      "Esteemed Mr Lebedev,\n",
      "Ladies and Gentlemen:\n",
      "You have gathered here to sum up the results of the past year. But I am sure that this will not be the end of the discussion. This year, Russia has turned a new page in its history. This is why now is the right time to openly discuss what changes have taken place in our judicial system over the last decade, and what it should look like in the near future.\n",
      "Of all legal professionals, judges have always enjoyed a special prestige, and they have been praised for a measured approach in their words and actions. In your hands, the law acquires real power and becomes an instrument of upholding justice. You are acting on behalf of the state and hand down your verdicts on behalf of the Russian Federation.\n",
      "A court of law means power, an enormous power that entails huge responsibilities. The usual view of a court as a disciplinary machine, as giving a speedy but not always fair judgment, should be confined to the past once and for all. The habit of seeking protection from superiors should be replaced in people’s minds with an understanding of the convenience and advantages of taking the matter to court, and defending their rights with your assistance.\n",
      "Today, citizens are doing this more willingly and frequently. But do the judicial systems and courts live up to these higher expectations? This is what we are going to talk about now. This is a good opportunity to ponder over the current condition of the judicial system.\n",
      "At present, about 850,000 criminal and civil cases are awaiting trial in Russian courts. Almost 8,000 cases were being tried in the Moscow courts alone as of January 1. During the past year, more than 2,000 cases were returned for further investigation, and one-third of all verdicts delayed.\n",
      "Regrettably, these figures show not only how busy judges are, but also how many people are still waiting for a fair resolution of their problems. Meanwhile, in many cases these problems will determine their future. Both you and I are fully aware of this. The defendants are spending months and sometimes years in detention facilities. Hearings on civil cases involving housing, inheritance and family issues are delayed for ages.\n",
      "Meanwhile, people are judging the effectiveness of government power, the integrity of courts, and the level of democracy by such worldly matters. For this reason, it is a huge liability to both the judiciary and the country’s leaders, and therefore to government authority as a whole.\n",
      "The judiciary’s real independence is the best indicator that a state is based on the rule of law. But this is an old and universal problem. It is as old as the world itself. In his time, Anatoly Koni said that a judge should be “protected against conditions conducive to cowardice and forced assentation.” He hit the nail on the head.\n",
      "Regrettably, we are witnessing relapses of the old attitude to courts as an appendage to the bureaucratic machine.\n",
      "For instance, it is the Russian president’s prerogative to delegate powers to judges. In this context, it is alarming that some regional leaders are trying to place judicial systems under their control.\n",
      "Everyone remembers the Ingush leaders’ attempt to hold a republican referendum on the procedures for appointing judges in violation of federal law and guarantees of equal rights for citizens throughout Russia.\n",
      "Moreover, the constitutions of some Russian republics still contain clauses under which only their residents can be appointed judges. This very formula has a dozen transgressions.\n",
      "I would like to say right away that here we fully support the position of the Supreme Court and the Russian Federation’s Council of Judges, which oppose any encroachments on the existing procedures for forming courts and appointing federal judges.\n",
      "I am equally against any talk about revising the judiciary’s current status and imposing limits on the guarantees of their immunity, independence and autonomy sanctioned by the law. Any attempts to transgress upon these constitutional principles will be nipped in the bud.\n",
      "More than eight years ago, the then Supreme Soviet of the Russian Federation approved the Judiciary Reform Concept, aimed at creating a strong and independent legal system.\n",
      "The judiciary took a direct part in this process of renewal. The Supreme Court initiated and adopted laws on military tribunals, the judicial department and the funding of courts in the Russian Federation. But for all the importance of the adopted legislation, the judicial system is still ridden with many serious problems and has many tasks still ahead of it.\n",
      "First, the legal foundation for administering justice is not in full accordance with the Russian Constitution. There are unjustified delays in the adoption of basic laws on courts of law. There are no new codes for criminal and legal proceedings and no legislative acts on administrative proceedings. Courts badly need these for their work. Russia’s Constitutional Court has already issued 14 resolutions on discrepancies between individual provisions of the code for criminal proceedings and the Constitution. The general message of these resolutions is to reinforce adversary proceedings. Maybe it is time to implement in full a constitutional rule whereby a person may be arrested or detained only on the basis of a court ruling. This does not mean that we should do it right now, but we should give it serious thought.\n",
      "Second, the old rules do not provide effective legal protection of the lawful rights and interests of citizens, in particular, those rules related to providing broader access to justice and defence during a preliminary investigation.\n",
      "Finally, Russian legislation should be reformed in line with the universally recognized norms of international law.\n",
      "You know that on May 5, 1998, Russia ratified the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, which has become part of our legal system. In addition to that, we have recognized the jurisdiction of the European Court of Human Rights. Today, we must pay special attention to those problems of the Russian judicial system that the European Court may object to.\n",
      "First of all, this applies to meeting reasonable deadlines for court deliberations. The European Court does not accept excuses such as overload, a lack of judges or shortage of funds when national courts drag out trials.\n",
      "Today, I would like to discuss another key aspect of your activities – cases involving economic crimes. The transition from a centralized, planned economy to one governed by the market is impossible without strengthening the foundations of the latter, primarily, the effective performance of legal institutions.\n",
      "In regulating the economy, the state should primarily guarantee the market’s streamlined functioning in a stable environment. This demand fully applies not only to the legislative and executive branches of government but also to courts of law and arbitration.\n",
      "The new civil and criminal codes combine two approaches to the protection of the rights and lawful interests of participants in economic relations. On the one hand, they guarantee an entrepreneur’s freedom of economic performance and rights. On the other hand, because of its interests, the state has its demands on economic agents as well. Your role here is to guarantee the interests of all participants by promoting tax collection, as well as combating money laundering and the illegal export of capital.\n",
      "I would like to stress one point. The government has been heavily criticized for abandoning the economy without a reason. I have already mentioned this several times, but I believe I can repeat it again when talking to my colleagues. The state should not interfere in the economy, as was the case before. It should not resurrect a command-based planned economy. Instead, it should create powerful levers and understandable rules, and it should enforce them in addition to regulating the economy. The state should make sure that the rules are the same for everyone and guarantee that all market players follow them. Only in this case will we have a transparent and attractive investment environment. Needless to say, the state should not only create new mechanisms, but also keep the old ones in good shape.\n",
      "This directly applies to the funding of the judicial system. Only recently, this question became so urgent that Russia’s Constitutional Court had to have its say.\n",
      "Article 124 of the Constitution reads that “courts of law shall be financed only out of the federal budget and financing shall ensure the full and independent administration of justice in accordance with federal law.”\n",
      "This concerns not only the funding of programmes for the development of the judicial system, but also the financial support of judges themselves. While receiving a modest salary, you are dealing with cases worth billions of roubles. You are fighting crime and dangerous offenders without proper protection for yourselves.\n",
      "These are the realities of today, and they do not give much reason for optimism. It goes without saying that everything should comply with the state’s abilities. But it is also clear that if the state wants everything to function normally, and to have a productive economy and effective institutions, it must pay more attention to this.\n",
      "I do not want to make any promises. It would be wrong to speak about a big rise in salaries. But I would like you to know that we understand that a rise is necessary, and we will certainly move in this direction. I must say that much has already been done to give judges their due. Last year, judges and court administration officials received their full salaries on time. Funding was increased by almost 184 million roubles in order to raise the official rate of pay. But this is only half the battle.\n",
      "Programmes to strengthen the rule of law and combat crime were not adequately funded. Many of the laws already passed are not being enforced for lack of money. Defendants’ constitutional right to a trial by jury is not being put into practice for the same reason. Today, trial by jury is limited to only nine regions of Russia, but it should be operating everywhere.\n",
      "Finally, sometimes for lack of money courts cannot even meet their basic needs and summon witnesses, interpreters, and experts as the law demands. They do not have enough forms, envelopes, and money for mailing expenses. There are still not enough computers or technical facilities for court records.\n",
      "We will not shirk our responsibility for this situation, and we will work to improve it. I have already said much to this effect. I think that if the state fails to pay proper attention to this problem, it will not be able to collect the taxes owed to it, and the economy will not perform well. It should therefore not be tight-fisted with the courts.\n",
      "Meanwhile, courts should also take steps to control their own expenses and streamline cash flows. Otherwise it will be difficult to resist attempts by some local leaders to “privatize” courts through their partial funding.\n",
      "There is one more major problem that I want to point out: personnel.\n",
      "I have already said that complaints about overload in the courts have surfaced so often that they have become commonplace. Indeed, there are still more than 1,000 vacancies for judges.\n",
      "This year, the authorised staff size was increased by a thousand positions by presidential decree. Federal judges will be relieved of part of the burden by the implementation of a federal law on justices of the peace; almost 5,500 people will be sworn in as justices.\n"

      "These plans are making it even more urgent to create an effective system for the training and proper screening of judges. It is essential not only to improve the screening process, but also to streamline the rules for appointing judges and removing them from office. The current procedures are complicated, take an extremely long time, and do not guarantee promotion.\n",
      "But I would also like to say that personnel problems are not limited to what I have just described. The authority of judicial power and its effective performance are largely determined by judges’ qualifications and their having an unbiased attitude. Needless to say, on average we have two or three times fewer judges per capita than many Western countries. But this should not deny our citizens their right to a speedy trial.\n",
      "My friends,\n",
      "You know well that the results of your work have a direct effect on the political and economic life of our society. Courts have been and remain a key factor in safeguarding democracy and allowing Russia to forge ahead in the new century.\n",
      "You have received a lot of extra work since the December elections. Citizens and associations have alerted you to violations of electoral laws by both federal and regional bodies of government. This flood of complaints is not likely to subside before the beginning of summer.\n",
      "You know our position – I mean the government’s position. The state and society need honest election results, and an open and honest election campaign. This is the only way of achieving a fully-fledged and effective government. This is the only way of guaranteeing democracy and order.\n",
      "During the conference you will certainly talk much about the implementation of the judicial reform. Let’s tell it straight – this reform has been dragged out; it is difficult, and society is looking at it ambiguously. Human faith in the inviolability of the law depends on its final result and on your personal decency and professionalism.\n",
      "I very much hope that you will continue to be guided in your work by the principles of professional honour, judicial duty and responsibility to our homeland. I would like to wish Russia’s judiciary the very best.\n",
      "Thank you for your attention.\n",

      "THE PRESIDENT:  Good evening, my fellow Americans.  I want to talk to you about where we are in the battle against COVID-19, the progress we’ve made, and the work we have left to do.\n",
      "\n",
      "And it starts with understanding this: Even as the Delta variant 19 [sic] has — COVID-19 — has been hitting this country hard, we have the tools to combat the virus, if we can come together as a country and use those tools.\n",
      "\n",
      "If we raise our vaccination rate, protect ourselves and others with masking and expanded testing, and identify people who are infected, we can and we will turn the tide on COVID-19.\n",
      "\n",
      "It will take a lot of hard work, and it’s going to take some time.  Many of us are frustrated with the nearly 80 million Americans who are still not vaccinated, even though the vaccine is safe, effective, and free.\n",
      "\n",
      "You might be confused about what is true and what is false about COVID-19.  So before I outline the new steps to fight COVID-19 that I’m going to be announcing tonight, let me give you some clear information about where we stand.\n",
      "\n",
      "First, we have cons- — we have made considerable progress\n",
      "in battling COVID-19.  When I became President, about 2 million Americans were fully vaccinated.  Today, over 175 million Americans have that protection. \n",
      "\n",
      "Before I took office, we hadn’t ordered enough vaccine for every American.  Just weeks in office, we did.  The week before I took office, on January 20th of this year, over 25,000 Americans died that week from COVID-19.  Last week, that grim weekly toll was down 70 percent.\n",
      "\n",
      "And in the three months before I took office, our economy was faltering, creating just 50,000 jobs a month.  We’re now averaging 700,000 new jobs a month in the past three months.\n",
      "\n",
      "This progress is real.  But while America is in much better shape than it was seven months ago when I took office, I need to tell you a second fact.\n",
      "\n",
      "We’re in a tough stretch, and it could last for a while.  The highly contagious Delta variant that I began to warn America about back in July spread in late summer like it did in other countries before us.\n",
      "\n",
      "While the vaccines provide strong protections for the vaccinated, we read about, we hear about, and we see the stories of hospitalized people, people on their death beds, among the unvaccinated over these past few weeks. \n",
      "\n",
      "This is a pandemic of the unvaccinated.  And it’s caused by the fact that despite America having an unprecedented and successful vaccination program, despite the fact that for almost five months free vaccines have been available in 80,000 different locations, we still have nearly 80 million Americans\n",
      "who have failed to get the shot. \n",
      "\n",
      "And to make matters worse, there are elected officials actively working to undermine the fight against COVID-19.  Instead of encouraging people to get vaccinated and mask up, they’re ordering mobile morgues for the unvaccinated dying from COVID in their communities.  This is totally unacceptable.\n",
      "\n",
      "Third, if you wonder how all this adds up, here’s the math:  The vast majority of Americans are doing the right thing.  Nearly three quarters of the eligible have gotten at least one shot, but one quarter has not gotten any.  That’s nearly 80 million Americans not vaccinated.  And in a country as large as ours, that’s 25 percent minority.  That 25 percent can cause a lot of damage — and they are.\n",
      "\n",
      "The unvaccinated overcrowd our hospitals, are overrunning the emergency rooms and intensive care units, leaving no room for someone with a heart attack, or pancreitis [pancreatitis], or cancer.\n",
      "\n",
      "And fourth, I want to emphasize that the vaccines provide very strong protection from severe illness from COVID-19.  I know there’s a lot of confusion and misinformation.  But the world’s leading scientists confirm that if you are fully vaccinated, your risk of severe illness from COVID-19 is very low. \n",
      "\n",
      "In fact, based on available data from the summer, only one of out of every 160,000 fully vaccinated Americans was hospitalized for COVID per day.\n",
      "\n",
      "These are the facts. \n",
      "\n",
      "So here’s where we stand: The path ahead, even with the Delta variant, is not nearly as bad as last winter.  But what makes it incredibly more frustrating is that we have the tools to combat COVID-19, and a distinct minority of Americans –supported by a distinct minority of elected officials — are keeping us from turning the corner.  These pandemic politics, as I refer to, are making people sick, causing unvaccinated people to die. \n",
      "\n",
      "We cannot allow these actions to stand in the way of protecting the large majority of Americans who have done their part and want to get back to life as normal. \n",
      "\n",
      "As your President, I’m announcing tonight a new plan to require more Americans to be vaccinated, to combat those blocking public health. \n",
      "\n",
      "My plan also increases testing, protects our economy, and will make our kids safer in schools.  It consists of six broad areas of action and many specific measures in each that — and each of those actions that you can read more about at WhiteHouse.gov.  WhiteHouse.gov.\n",
      "\n",
      "The measures — these are going to take time to have full impact.  But if we implement them, I believe and the scientists indicate, that in the months ahead we can reduce the number of unvaccinated Americans, decrease hospitalizations and deaths, and allow our children to go to school safely and keep our economy strong by keeping businesses open.\n",
      "\n",
      "First, we must increase vaccinations among the unvaccinated with new vaccination requirements.  Of the nearly 80 million eligible Americans who have not gotten vaccinated, many said they were waiting for approval from the Food and Drug Administration — the FDA.  Well, last month, the FDA granted that approval.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, the time for waiting is over.  This summer, we made progress through the combination of vaccine requirements and incentives, as well as the FDA approval.  Four million more people got their first shot in August than they did in July. \n",
      "\n",
      "But we need to do more.  This is not about freedom or personal choice.  It’s about protecting yourself and those around you — the people you work with, the people you care about, the people you love.\n",
      "\n",
      "My job as President is to protect all Americans. \n",
      "\n",
      "So, tonight, I’m announcing that the Department of Labor is developing an emergency rule to require all employers with 100 or more employees, that together employ over 80 million workers, to ensure their workforces are fully vaccinated or show a negative test at least once a week.\n",
      "\n",
      "Some of the biggest companies are already requiring this: United Airlines, Disney, Tysons Food, and even Fox News.\n",
      "\n",
      "The bottom line: We’re going to protect vaccinated workers from unvaccinated co-workers.  We’re going to reduce the spread of COVID-19 by increasing the share of the workforce that is vaccinated in businesses all across America.\n",
      "\n",
      "My plan will extend the vaccination requirements that I previously issued in the healthcare field.  Already, I’ve announced, we’ll be requiring vaccinations that all nursing home workers who treat patients on Medicare and Medicaid, because I have that federal authority.\n",
      "\n",
      "Tonight, I’m using that same authority to expand that to cover those who work in hospitals, home healthcare facilities, or other medical facilities –- a total of 17 million healthcare workers.\n",
      "\n",
      "If you’re seeking care at a health facility, you should be able to know that the people treating you are vaccinated.  Simple.  Straightforward.  Period.\n",
      "\n",
      "Next, I will sign an executive order that will now require all executive branch federal employees to be vaccinated — all.  And I’ve signed another executive order that will require federal contractors to do the same.\n",
      "\n",
      "If you want to work with the federal government and do business with us, get vaccinated.  If you want to do business with the federal government, vaccinate your workforce. \n",
      "\n",
      "And tonight, I’m removing one of the last remaining obstacles that make it difficult for you to get vaccinated.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Department of Labor will require employers with 100 or more workers to give those workers paid time off to get vaccinated.  No one should lose pay in order to get vaccinated or take a loved one to get vaccinated.\n",
      "\n",
      "Today, in total, the vaccine requirements in my plan will affect about 100 million Americans –- two thirds of all workers. \n",
      "\n",
      "And for other sectors, I issue this appeal: To those of you running large entertainment venues — from sports arenas to concert venues to movie theaters — please require folks to get vaccinated or show a negative test as a condition of entry.\n",
      "\n",
      "And to the nation’s family physicians, pediatricians, GPs — general practitioners –- you’re the most trusted medical voice to your patients.  You may be the one person who can get someone to change their mind about being vaccinated. \n",
      "\n",
      "Tonight, I’m asking each of you to reach out to your unvaccinated patients over the next two weeks and make a personal appeal to them to get the shot.  America needs your personal involvement in this critical effort.\n",
      "\n",
      "And my message to unvaccinated Americans is this: What more is there to wait for?  What more do you need to see?  We’ve made vaccinations free, safe, and convenient.\n",
      "\n",
      "The vaccine has FDA approval.  Over 200 million Americans have gotten at least one shot. \n",
      "\n",
      "We’ve been patient, but our patience is wearing thin.  And your refusal has cost all of us.  So, please, do the right thing.  But just don’t take it from me; listen to the voices of unvaccinated Americans who are lying in hospital beds, taking their final breaths, saying, “If only I had gotten vaccinated.”  “If only.”\n",
      "\n",
      "It’s a tragedy.  Please don’t let it become yours.\n",
      "\n",
      "The second piece of my plan is continuing to protect the vaccinated.\n",
      "\n",
      "For the vast majority of you who have gotten vaccinated, I understand your anger at those who haven’t gotten vaccinated.  I understand the anxiety about getting a “breakthrough” case.\n",
      "\n",
      "But as the science makes clear, if you’re fully vaccinated, you’re highly protected from severe illness, even if you get COVID-19.  \n",
      "\n",
      "In fact, recent data indicates there is only one confirmed positive case per 5,000 fully vaccinated Americans per day.\n",
      "\n",
      "You’re as safe as possible, and we’re doing everything we can to keep it that way — keep it that way, keep you safe.\n",
      "\n",
      "That’s where boosters come in — the shots that give you even more protection than after your second shot.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, I know there’s been some confusion about boosters.  So, let me be clear: Last month, our top government doctors announced an initial plan for booster shots for vaccinated Americans.  They believe that a booster is likely to provide the highest level of protection yet.\n",
      "\n",
      "Of course, the decision of which booster shots to give, when to start them, and who will give them, will be left completely to the scientists at the FDA and the Centers for Disease Control.\n",
      "\n",
      "But while we wait, we’ve done our part.  We’ve bought enough boosters — enough booster shots — and the distribution system is ready to administer them.\n",
      "\n",
      "As soon as they are authorized, those eligible will be able to get a booster right away in tens of thousands of site across the — sites across the country for most Americans, at your nearby drug store, and for free. \n",
      "\n",
      "The third piece of my plan is keeping — and maybe the most important — is keeping our children safe and our schools open.  For any parent, it doesn’t matter how low the risk of any illness or accident is when it comes to your child or grandchild.  Trust me, I know. \n",
      "\n",
      "So, let me speak to you directly.  Let me speak to you directly to help ease some of your worries.\n",
      "\n",
      "It comes down to two separate categories: children ages 12 and older who are eligible for a vaccine now, and children ages 11 and under who are not are yet eligible.\n",
      "\n",
      "The safest thing for your child 12 and older is to get them vaccinated.  They get vaccinated for a lot of things.  That’s it.  Get them vaccinated.\n",
      "\n",
      "As with adults, almost all the serious COVID-19 cases we’re seeing among adolescents are in unvaccinated 12- to 17-year-olds — an age group that lags behind in vaccination rates.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, parents, please get your teenager vaccinated.\n",
      "\n",
      "What about children under the age of 12 who can’t get vaccinated yet?  Well, the best way for a parent to protect their child under the age of 12 starts at home.  Every parent, every teen sibling, every caregiver around them should be vaccinated.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Children have four times higher chance of getting hospitalized if they live in a state with low vaccination rates rather than the states with high vaccination rates. \n",
      "\n",
      "Now, if you’re a parent of a young child, you’re wondering when will it be — when will it be — the vaccine available for them.  I strongly support an independent scientific review for vaccine uses for children under 12.  We can’t take shortcuts with that scientific work. \n",
      "\n",
      "But I’ve made it clear I will do everything within my power to support the FDA with any resource it needs to continue to do this as safely and as quickly as possible, and our nation’s top doctors are committed to keeping the public at large updated on the process so parents can plan.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now to the schools.  We know that if schools follow the science and implement the safety measures — like testing, masking, adequate ventilation systems that we provided the money for, social distancing, and vaccinations — then children can be safe from COVID-19 in schools.\n",
      "\n",
      "Today, about 90 percent of school staff and teachers are vaccinated.  We should get that to 100 percent.  My administration has already acquired teachers at the schools run by the Defense Department — because I have the authority as President in the federal system — the Defense Department and the Interior Department — to get vaccinated.  That’s authority I possess. \n",
      "\n",
      "Tonight, I’m announcing that we’ll require all of nearly 300,000 educators in the federal paid program, Head Start program, must be vaccinated as well to protect your youngest — our youngest — most precious Americans and give parents the comfort.\n",
      "\n",
      "And tonight, I’m calling on all governors to require vaccination for all teachers and staff.  Some already have done so, but we need more to step up. \n",
      "\n",
      "Vaccination requirements in schools are nothing new.  They work.  They’re overwhelmingly supported by educators and their unions.  And to all school officials trying to do the right thing by our children: I’ll always be on your side. \n",
      "\n",
      "Let me be blunt.  My plan also takes on elected officials and states that are undermining you and these lifesaving actions.  Right now, local school officials are trying to keep children safe in a pandemic while their governor picks a fight with them and even threatens their salaries or their jobs.  Talk about bullying in schools.  If they’ll not help — if these governors won’t help us beat the pandemic, I’ll use my power as President to get them out of the way. \n",
      "\n",
      "The Department of Education has already begun to take legal action against states undermining protection that local school officials have ordered.  Any teacher or school official whose pay is withheld for doing the right thing, we will have that pay restored by the federal government 100 percent.  I promise you I will have your back. \n",
      "\n",
      "The fourth piece of my plan is increasing testing and masking.  From the start, America has failed to do enough COVID-19 testing.  In order to better detect and control the Delta variant, I’m taking steps tonight to make testing more available, more affordable, and more convenient.  I’ll use the Defense Production Act to increase production of rapid tests, including those that you can use at home. \n",
      "\n",
      "While that production is ramping up, my administration has worked with top retailers, like Walmart, Amazon, and Kroger’s, and tonight we’re announcing that, no later than next week, each of these outlets will start to sell at-home rapid test kits at cost for the next three months.  This is an immediate price reduction for at-home test kits for up to 35 percent reduction.\n",
      "\n",
      "We’ll also expand — expand free testing at 10,000 pharmacies around the country.  And we’ll commit — we’re committing $2 billion to purchase nearly 300 million rapid tests for distribution to community health centers, food banks, schools, so that every American, no matter their income, can access free and convenient tests.  This is important to everyone, particularly for a parent or a child — with a child not old enough to be vaccinated.  You’ll be able to test them at home and test those around them.\n",
      "\n",
      "In addition to testing, we know masking helps stop the spread of COVID-19.  That’s why when I came into office, I required masks for all federal buildings and on federal lands, on airlines, and other modes of transportation.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Today — tonight, I’m announcing that the Transportation Safety Administration — the TSA — will double the fines on travelers that refuse to mask.  If you break the rules, be prepared to pay. \n",
      "\n",
      "And, by the way, show some respect.  The anger you see on television toward flight attendants and others doing their job is wrong; it’s ugly. \n",
      "\n",
      "The fifth piece of my plan is protecting our economic recovery.  Because of our vaccination program and the American Rescue Plan, which we passed early in my administration, we’ve had record job creation for a new administration, economic growth unmatched in 40 years.  We cannot let unvaccinated do this progress — undo it, turn it back. \n",
      "\n",
      "So tonight, I’m announcing additional steps to strengthen our economic recovery.  We’ll be expanding COVID-19 Economic Injury Disaster Loan programs.  That’s a program that’s going to allow small businesses to borrow up to $2 million from the current $500,000 to keep going if COVID-19 impacts on their sales. \n",
      "\n",
      "These low-interest, long-term loans require no repayment for two years and be can used to hire and retain workers, purchase inventory, or even pay down higher cost debt racked up since the pandemic began.  I’ll also be taking additional steps to help small businesses stay afloat during the pandemic. \n",
      "\n",
      "Sixth, we’re going to continue to improve the care of those who do get COVID-19.  In early July, I announced the deployment of surge response teams.  These are teams comprised of experts from the Department of Health and Human Services, the CDC, the Defense Department, and the Federal Emergency Management Agency — FEMA — to areas in the country that need help to stem the spread of COVID-19. \n",
      "\n",
      "Since then, the federal government has deployed nearly 1,000 staff, including doctors, nurses, paramedics, into 18 states.  Today, I’m announcing that the Defense Department will double the number of military health teams that they’ll deploy to help their fellow Americans in hospitals around the country. \n",
      "\n",
      "Additionally, we’re increasing the availability of new medicines recommended by real doctors, not conspir- — conspiracy theorists.  The monoclonal antibody treatments have been shown to reduce the risk of hospitalization by up to 70 percent for unvaccinated people at risk of developing sefe- — severe disease. \n",
      "\n",
      "We’ve already distributed 1.4 million courses of these treatments to save lives and reduce the strain on hospitals.  Tonight, I’m announcing we will increase the average pace of shipment across the country of free monoclonal antibody treatments by another 50 percent.\n",
      "\n",
      "Before I close, let me say this: Communities of color are disproportionately impacted by this virus.  And as we continue to battle COVID-19, we will ensure that equity continues to be at the center of our response.  We’ll ensure that everyone is reached.  My first responsibility as President is to protect the American people and make sure we have enough vaccine for every American, including enough boosters for every American who’s approved to get one. \n",
      "\n",
      "We also know this virus transcends borders.  That’s why, even as we execute this plan at home, we need to continue fighting the virus overseas, continue to be the arsenal of vaccines. \n",
      "\n",
      "We’re proud to have donated nearly 140 million vaccines over 90 countries, more than all other countries combined, including Europe, China, and Russia combined.  That’s American leadership on a global stage, and that’s just the beginning.\n",
      "\n",
      "We’ve also now started to ship another 500 million COVID vaccines — Pfizer vaccines — purchased to donate to 100 lower-income countries in need of vaccines.  And I’ll be announcing additional steps to help the rest of the world later this month.\n",
      "\n",
      "As I recently released the key parts of my pandemic preparedness plan so that America isn’t caught flat-footed when a new pandemic comes again — as it will — next month, I’m also going to release the plan in greater detail.\n",
      "\n",
      "So let me close with this: We have so- — we’ve made so much progress during the past seven months of this pandemic.  The recent increases in vaccinations in August already are having an impact in some states where case counts are dropping in recent days.  Even so, we remain at a critical moment, a critical time.  We have the tools.  Now we just have to finish the job with truth, with science, with confidence, and together as one nation.\n",
      "\n",
      "Look, we’re the United States of America.  There’s nothing — not a single thing — we’re unable to do if we do it together.  So let’s stay together.\n",
      "\n",
      "God bless you all and all those who continue to serve on the frontlines of this pandemic.  And may God protect our troops.\n",
      "\n",
      "Get vaccinated.\n",

    "Mr. President,\n",
    "\n",
    "China supports and highly appreciates Russia for proposing this ministerial meeting of the Security Council. To resolve conflicts in the Middle East and remove the threats of terrorism bears on the future of world peace and is the responsibility of the Security Council.\n",
    "\n",
    "The situation in the Middle East region is serious and disturbing. Differences among nations, religious sects and ethnic groups aggravate one another. Wars and conflicts, humanitarian disasters and terrorist threats are interwoven. The image of the drowned Syrian boy challenges human morality and questions the conscience of the international community.\n",
    "\n",
    "Today, we are gathered here at the Security Council Chamber not to do empty talk, but to reflect on the root causes of the turmoils of the Middle East, make a just and objective projection of the regional situation, seek a feasible and effective solution, and strive to build a framework of peace that can be accepted by all parties. More importantly, we are here to seize opportunity and take action to break the vicious cycle of incessant turbulence in the Middle East, honor the mandate entrusted to the Security Council by the UN Charter and meet the expectations on us from the international community and especially from the people of the Middle East.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mr. President,\n",
    "\n",
    "China hopes that the international community and people of the Middle East will jointly build a Middle East of peace, tolerance and self-advancement.\n",
    "\n",
    "First and foremost, people need a Middle East of peace. Stability is a blessing while turmoil brings peril. Peace is the most precious. The 70-year history of the UN has all along witnessed the gunsmoke in the Middle East and the displacement of innocent civilians. The history of the Middle East told us time and again that violence cannot win peace and hatred never brings hope. Violence cannot fully bring the problem to an end and hatred will only extinguish hope. Only by respecting each other can people live together peacefully, only by adhering to dialogue can problems be resolved and only by promoting friendship can a better future be created. This is what the international community hopes to see and what China's diplomacy aims to achieve.\n",
    "\n",
    "People need a Middle East of tolerance. The Middle East region, once a cradle of human civilization, boasts a glorious history with major contribution to human progress. Its flourishing civilization and cultural confidence has made this region an important platform for exchanges and integration of Eastern and Western civilizations. In the 21st century, co-existence of civilizations requires the spirit of harmony without uniformity more than before and progress of the society calls for inclusiveness and broad-mindedness. Different religions should tolerate and learn from each other and various ethnicities should live in harmony.\n",
    "\n",
    "People need a Middle East of self-advancement. The Middle East is the home of all the peoples in the region. Therefore, its future and destiny should be determined by countries in the region through consultation. Countries outside the region may provide help but should avoid interfering in the internal affairs of other countries or, even less so, imposing a specific model on them. Regional order should be shaped by countries in the region on the basis of the UN Charter and in light of the circumstances on the ground and the needs of the people there.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mr. President,\n",
    "\n",
    "The Syrian crisis has been lingering on for almost five years. The international community should not stand by and do nothing, nor should it intervene arbitrarily. We need to step up humanitarian assistance. In particular, the growing tension around the migrant crisis needs to be addressed to avoid more tragedies. We welcome greater efforts by the EU member states to this end. Syria's neighboring countries, which have received more than 4 million Syrian refugees over the past few years, face even greater and more immediate pressure. It is both unfair and unreasonable to forget their efforts and ignore their difficulties.\n",
    "\n",
    "Political settlement is the only way out of the Syrian crisis. To achieve this, parties need to find a middle way that draws on workable practices of other countries and regions, suits Syria's national conditions, and accommodates the interests of all parties. The resurgence of violent and terrorist forces and the spread of migrant crisis have further driven home to all parties the necessity and urgency of seeking a political settlement to the Syrian issue. China calls on all parties to seize the opportunity arising from a growing desire for political settlement, give positive consideration to the convening of the Geneva III Conference on Syria, and push for the restart of an inclusive political transition process that does not set preconditions or pre-determined results and involves all parties to the conflict. Let the Syrian people decide for themselves the future of their country with the help of the international community and the support of the UN Security Council. To achieve this goal, UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon and Special Envoy de Mistura are making active mediation efforts. China hopes all parties will unite behind the UN endeavor in this regard and create conditions, build consensus and foster an enabling environment for it to succeed.\n",
    "\n",
    "China is deeply concerned about the recent conflict between Israel and Palestine in the Al-Aqsa Mosque area. Violence never brings real security; it only entrenches hatred. China firmly supports the early restoration of the Palestinian people's lawful rights, and the realization of the peaceful co-existence between the two states of Palestine and Israel. The international community should work together to facilitate the restart of talks between Palestine and Israel on a broad-based platform with the direct participation of all major parties concerned. Only talks can bring hopes for peace and a better future.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mr. President,\n",
    "\n",
    "Terrorism is a common scourge of mankind. The evolving situation in the Middle East has repeatedly shown that terrorist activities are all the same in nature and, to fight them, we must not adopt double standards. Combating violent terrorism in all its manifestations should be the shared responsibility and priority for countries in the region and the international community.\n",
    "\n",
    "China calls for broad-based and comprehensive international counter-terrorism cooperation under the UN framework. Such cooperation should include the following priorities: combating cyber terrorism, preventing violent and extremist ideologies, blocking the flow of terrorists and terrorist funding, strengthening intelligence exchange, and giving full play to the role of the Security Council.\n",
    "\n",
    "China believes in a comprehensive response to terrorism that addresses both the symptoms and root causes. Regional instability and development gap breed terrorism, while ethnic disunity and religious conflicts allow radical ideologies to resurface. To fundamentally resolve issues that breed and feed terrorism, we must properly address regional disputes, restore regional stability, enhance the governance capabilities of various countries, speed up economic development and improve people's lives in tangible ways.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mr. President,\n",
    "\n",
    "China hopes this meeting of the Security Council will be a new starting point, and from here the international community will renew their efforts to open up a new prospect of peace and security in the Middle East."
