Remarks by the President at the 50th Anniversary of the Presidential Medal of Freedom","Good evening, everybody.  Please have a seat.  Michelle and I are so pleased to join you tonight to honor the legacy of an American leader in a building dedicated to the preservation of our American history. 

And we are thrilled to be joined by so many people whose accomplishments helped write new chapters in that history.  This morning, I recognized 16 brilliant, compassionate, wildly talented people with the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the nation’s highest civilian award.  And that was intimidating enough.  Tonight, I’m facing dozens of you. 

To the Presidential Medal of Freedom recipients of this year and years past, it is a great honor to be with you for this anniversary celebration.  To Wayne Clough, thank you for hosting us and for all the Smithsonian does to enrich our cultural heritage.  And to Jack, I have to say that our new ambassador to Japan, I’m sure, would be pleased with how you performed this evening.  I’ll give her a full report.  (Laughter.)  To all the family members of the Kennedy family, we are grateful for your presence and your enduring contributions to the life of our country.

For centuries, awards have existed for military valor.  And fifty years ago, President John F. Kennedy established a way to award extraordinary civilian virtue -- contributions to our country, service to our democracy, a dedication to our humanity that has advanced the common interest of freedom-loving people, both here at home and around the world. 

Since its creation, the Presidential Medal of Freedom has paid tribute to the creativity of writers, and artists, and entertainers.  We’ve recognized the leadership of elected officials and civil rights organizers; the imagination of scientists and business leaders; the grit and determination of our astronauts and our athletes.   Because there is no one way to contribute to the success of America.  What makes us great is that we believe in a certain set of values that encourage freedom of expression and aspiration.  We celebrate imagination and education and occasional rebellion.  And we refuse to set limits on what we can do or who we can be. 

Other peoples in other times have marked their history by moments of conquest at war, by dominion over empires.  But in the arc of human history, the American experience stands apart, because our triumph is not simply found in the exertion of our power; it’s found in the example of our people. Our particular genius over 237 years has been something more than the sum of our individual excellence, but rather a culmination of our common endeavors.

It’s a truth that resonated with President Kennedy when he said, “…I am certain that after the dust of centuries has passed over our cities, we…will be remembered not for our victories or defeats in battle or in politics, but for our contribution to the human spirit.”

And that unbending belief -- that the power to make great a nation is found in its people and in their freedom -- that was his philosophy.  That is his legacy. 

And it’s a legacy told in villages around the world that have clean water, or a new school, and a steady friend in the United States, thanks to the volunteers of the Peace Corps.  It’s a legacy found in the courage of all who serve under our proud flag, willing, like President Kennedy himself, to pay any price and bear any burden for the survival and success of our liberty. 

It’s a legacy on display in the arts and culture that he and Jackie championed as part of our national character, a legacy planted on the moon that he said that we’d visit and that we did, in the stars beyond, but also in the breakthroughs of the generations of scientists that his audacious promise inspired.

It’s a legacy continued by his brothers and his sisters, who have left this a more gentle and compassionate country.  Jean, a Medal of Freedom recipient herself and a diplomat in every sense, is with us tonight.  Bobby, whose wife, Ethel is one of my dearest friends, as Jack noted, would be celebrating Bobby’s 88th birthday today.  Eunice and Pat were devoted advocates for Americans of all abilities.  And Teddy, the youngest brother with the biggest heart -- he was a happy warrior who we were sent here to serve and waged a decades-long battle on behalf of those folks who sent us here -– for workers’ rights, and immigrants’ rights, and the right to affordable health care.  Tonight, our sympathies are with the love of Teddy’s life, Vicki, as she mourns the loss of her father, Judge Edmund Reggie. 

And it’s all tolled a legacy of service that the Kennedy family continues to this day -- from Caroline, who’s already drawing crowds of her own as she settles into her role as ambassador to Japan; to his great-nephew, and Massachusetts’ newest Congressman, Joe Kennedy; to the school of public service that bears the family name and teaches its young leaders how they, too, might one day pass the torch to a new generation.

This is a legacy of a man who could have retreated to a life of luxury and ease, but who chose to live a life in the arena -- sailing sometimes against the wind, sometimes with it.  And that’s why, 50 years later, John F. Kennedy stands for posterity as he did in life -- young, and bold, and daring.  And he stays with us in our imagination not because he left us too soon, but because he embodied the character of the people he led.  Resilient, resolute.  Fearless and fun-loving.  Defiant in the face of impossible odds and, most of all, determined to make the world anew -- not settling for what is but rather for what might be.  And in his idealism –- his sober, square-jawed idealism –- we are reminded that the power to change this country is ours.

This afternoon, Michelle and I were joined by President Clinton and Secretary Clinton to pay tribute to that proud legacy.  We had a chance to lay a wreath at the gravesite at Arlington, where President Kennedy is surrounded by his wife and younger brothers, and where he will rest in peace for all time, remembered not just for his victories in battle or in politics, but for the words he uttered all those years ago:  “We…will be remembered…for our contribution to the human spirit.”

How blessed we are to live in a country where these contributions overflow in ways both heralded and not so heralded.  The thousands of people in San Francisco who helped a little boy recovering from cancer live out his superhero dreams -- that’s part of that spirit.  The Marines deploying relief after a devastating typhoon and all across an ocean, people checking on their neighbors after a tornado; the families across the country who will spend Thanksgiving Day cooking feasts so others less fortunate might eat -- that’s part of the spirit. 

That’s who we are -- a people whose greatness comes not by settling for what we can achieve in our own lives, but also because we dare to ask what we can do, as citizens, to contribute to this grand experiment we call America.

And that’s what our Presidential Medal of Freedom honorees embody, each and every one of them who are here today and those who we remember posthumously.  That’s the living legacy of the Kennedy family.  And that is the responsibility we all welcome, as Americans, for our lifetime on this planet.

We are extraordinarily blessed to be Americans because we have the opportunity to serve in ways that so many of you have served, because we have the opportunity to touch lives in the ways that so many of you have touched lives.

God bless you all, and God bless the United States of America.",President,Barack Obama,https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/the-press-office/2013/11/20/remarks-president-50th-anniversary-presidential-medal-freedom,,NATIONALISM
Russia,31-03-2010,Dmitry Medvedev,Dmitry Medvedev met with the Security Council members to discuss ways to fight terrorism more effectively,"Colleagues, we are meeting out of schedule today. This is for obvious reasons, namely, the tragic events in Moscow – the bombings in the metro. Today, blasts also took place in Kizlyar [in Daghestan], killing colleagues from Daghestan’s police force. These acts are links in the same chain, instances of the same terrorist activity that has recently reared its head once more in the Caucasus, and which we have been fighting and will continue to fight.

The state authorities will provide assistance to the families of those killed and to the injured in both the Moscow and Dagestan bombings, of course. 

But we are here today to discuss ways to fight terrorism more effectively, including by addressing the weak spots that the whole country is talking about now. This is a very difficult task, and everyone needs to be aware of this: those present here today, and all of our citizens. But this is something we must address, all the more so as the terrorists’ goal is to destabilise our country, undermine civil society and sow fear and panic among the public. We will not allow this to happen. We will direct everything we do, all of our efforts on consolidating our country and people.

As I already said, all of the terrorists will be found and eliminated. I therefore propose that the FSB and the [Prosecutor General’s Office] Investigative Committee update us on how the investigation is progressing. 

I met yesterday with members of the judiciary. It would make sense to analyse judicial practice regarding particular charges, including terrorism charges, reflect on the way terrorism is prosecuted under criminal law, and pay more attention to preventing this kind of crime, including through judicial means.

There is another issue that also calls for our attention, namely, the need to protect sites, above all transport infrastructure and public places from terrorist attacks. I have already given the Government instructions to work on this matter and the Government has discussed the issue.

I signed an executive order today on establishing a comprehensive transport safety system. This order sets out the steps we need to take: draft the programme, equip the most vulnerable parts of the transport system as soon as we can (we should try to do this even faster than the deadline set by the order), implement technical solutions, organise the information systems’ functioning. We need to get all of this under control and we also need to set the proportionate and in such cases necessary responsibility of the transporters, local authorities and everyone involved in transport. All of these different aspects will be reflected in the action plan the Government draws up.

The last thing I wanted to say at the start of this meeting is that we need to improve the situation in the North Caucasus republics in general with terrorism prevention work, educational campaigns and economic programmes. Right from the outset this has been the objective of our new Deputy Prime Minister and Presidential Plenipotentiary Envoy [to the North Caucasus Federal District Alexander Khloponin]. These programmes must all go ahead no matter what the circumstances. Resolving social and economic problems is in many respects the key to bringing about change in the situation. Apart from the security side of things, we also need to work on this, work with the people, work with communities and offer them better conditions for life.

Remarks by the President During Visit to Power Africa Innovation Fair","Now, one other thing I want to point out -- so our Power Africa initiative has been leveraging private capital to invest in electrification all across the continent.  And our preliminary goal was 10,000 megawatts; now we’re looking at 30,000 megawatts, and we’re well on our way.

Some of those megawatts are going to be generated by very traditional power plants and the traditional financing and large-scale capital.  But part of what all these folks represent is the creativity of recognizing that there are going to be a lot of ways of generating power and a lot of different distribution mechanisms.  And the models that we have in the United States may not always be perfectly adaptable to a rural region of a country, where you might wait 20 years before you get all the power lines in. 

Moreover, part of what’s taking place is because -- you notice these solar panels -- this is an opportunity for countries like Africa to leapfrog over dirty energy and immediately go to clean energy.  And so this mix of traditional products combined with these innovative ways of both producing energy and distributing it is why we think this is going to be such a promising initiative over the next several years.

There was an article, I think a while back, about well, how much electricity has Power Africa actually produced lately?  And I would just point out that if you wanted to start a power plant in the United States, it doesn’t take a year to get that done.  In fact, what’s happening is, is that financing, the transactions have been completed, plans are underway, and the work is being done -- now we’re going to start seeing thousands, then ten of thousands, then hundreds of thousands, and then ultimately millions of households all across this continent with electrical power that can boost productivity and economic growth all across the continent.  

So it’s really promising.  We’re really excited about it.",President,Barack Obama,https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/the-press-office/2015/07/25/remarks-president-during-visit-power-africa-innovation-fair,,DEVELOPMENT

Remarks by the President at Diplomatic Corps Reception","Good afternoon, everyone.  I just had the opportunity to greet each of you in person.  And we welcome all of you.  Each year, the diplomatic corps comes so that we can say thank you for the partnership between our nations and our peoples, and reaffirm our shared commitment to promoting security and peace and human dignity around the world.  

Obviously, we come here with heavier hearts than normal.  Overnight in Nice, we witnessed another tragic and appalling attack on the freedom and the peace that we cherish.

Today, our hearts are with the people of France and with all the innocent men, women and so many children who were hurt or killed in this sickening attack.  This includes Americans that we know of -- a family from Texas, a father and young son, just 11 years old, who were there on vacation.  Their family, like so many others, are devastated.  They're grieving.  They need all the love and support of our American family as they grapple with an unimaginable loss, and try to get through what are going to be very difficult days.

And so on behalf of all of us, I think, I want to welcome our friend, Ambassador Araud of France.  And I had a chance to meet with him right before I came out so that he knew that it's not just the United States of America, but the entire world that stands in solidarity with the people of France during this difficult time.  

I spoke with President Hollande earlier today.  And in addition to conveying deep condolences, I reminded him that France is America's oldest ally and one of our strongest.  We owe our freedom to each other.  Americans and French have stood together for two centuries.  And I told President Hollande that we will stand united now -- in our grief; in our praying for the many who are injured, many of whom are fighting for their lives.  And we pledge to stand with our French friends as we defend our nations against this scourge of terrorism and violence.  

And this is a threat to all of us.  We don’t know all the details, but what we know is the capacity of even a single individual to do extraordinary harm to our people, to our way of life.  A lot of nations represented here today have been impacted this year and in previous years.  In recent weeks, we’ve seen heinous attacks, inspired or directed by ISIL, here in the United States, in Turkey, in Iraq, in Bangladesh, in Saudi Arabia.  And these terrorists are targeting and killing innocent people of all backgrounds and all faiths, including Muslims.  And I know I speak for all of us when I say that these individuals and these networks are an affront to all of our humanity.

Many of the nations that are represented here today are part of our global coalition against ISIL.  And I want to take this opportunity to say once more:  We will not be deterred.  We will not relent.  We’re going to keep working together to prevent attacks and defend our homeland.  We are going to keep taking out ISIL leaders and pushing ISIL back in Syria and Iraq.  We’re going to keep standing with our partners, from Africa to Afghanistan.  And we are going to destroy this vile terrorist organization.  

And in contrast to these terrorists who only know how to kill and destroy, we’re going to win this fight by building; by never giving up on diplomacy to end the Syrian civil war; by working with partners around the world, including Muslim communities, to push back against hateful ideologies that twist and distort Islam -- a religion that teaches peace and justice and compassion.  We will defeat these ideologies by offering a better vision of development and economic progress, so people, especially young people, have more hope and opportunity and are less susceptible to extremism and violence in the first place.  And we will continue to promote political opportunity and democracy so citizens have a say in their future.  

And we will win this fight by staying true to our values -- values of pluralism and rule of law and diversity and freedoms, like the freedom of religion, freedom of speech and assembly -- the very freedoms that the people of Nice were celebrating last night on Bastille Day.  In the wake of last night’s attacks, we’ve heard more suggestions that all Muslims in America be targeted, tested for their beliefs; some deported or jailed.  And the very suggestion is repugnant and an affront to everything that we stand for as Americans.  

We cannot give in to fear, or turn on each other, or sacrifice our way of life.  We cannot let ourselves be divided by religion -- because that’s exactly what the terrorists want.  We should never do their work for them.  And here in the United States, our freedoms -- including freedom of religion -- help keep us strong and safe, and we have to be vigilant and defend our security and our freedoms.    

And all of us -- whatever nations we represent here -- I think have to step back and reflect on what we are doing to eliminate this kind of chronic violence.  It's been a difficult several weeks in the United States.  But the divide that exists is not between races and ethnicities and religions; it is between people who recognize the common humanity of all people and are willing to build institutions that promote that common humanity, and those who do not -- those who would suggest that somebody is less than them because of their tribe, or their ethnicity, or their faith, or their color.  And those impulses exist in all our countries.  And those impulses, when we do not speak out against them and build strong institutions to protect people from those impulses, they can take over, they can be unleashed -- so that all of us have responsibilities, not just a few.  

I want to say that even as we are relentless against terrorists, it's also worthy for us to recognize that our nations have worked together for security and peace and human dignity around the world.  I want to thank so many of your countries for the partnership that we’ve forged and the progress we’ve achieved together over these past eight years in rescuing the global economy and securing vulnerable nuclear materials.  A comprehensive deal to prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon.  Halting the spread of Ebola, and thereby saving countless lives.  In Paris, the most ambitious agreement in history to fight climate change.  A new sustainable development set of goals to end extreme poverty and promote health and education and equality for all people, including women.

And through the efforts of many of you, we've continued to try to move beyond old conflicts:  Supporting the transition to democracy in Burma.  Forging a new partnership with Vietnam.  Deepening our new chapter of engagement with the Cuban people.  Helping to support the efforts in Colombia to end the decades-long conflict.  That’s the power of diplomacy.  That’s what’s possible when our nations and our peoples work together in a spirit of mutual interest and mutual respect.  

And what a contrast to the death and nihilism that terrorists offer.  What a powerful reminder of the progress and opportunity and hope that we can advance when, as nations and as peoples and as individuals, we refuse to be defined by our differences alone, and we remember that we are all part of one human race.  Even on difficult days like this, that’s what gives me hope.  And that’s what should give us all hope.  Because on this planet of more than seven billion people, the hatred and violence of a few ultimately is no match for the love and decency and hard work of people of goodwill and compassion, so long as we stand up for those values and so long as we answer those who would undermine those values.  

I'm very proud of the work that we've done over these last seven and a half years in partnership with your countries.  And so long as I have the privilege of being the President of the United States, I will continue to stand alongside you to promote those values all across the world.

Thank you very much, everybody.",President,Barack Obama,https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/the-press-office/2016/07/15/remarks-president-diplomatic-corps-reception,,INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS
USA,18-11-2014,Barack Obama,"
Remarks by the President Before Meeting with National Security and Public Health Teams on Ebola"," Well, I’ve got my team here to talk about Ebola.  But before I do, I want to just make mention of the horrific attacks that took place in Jerusalem. 

We know that two attackers senselessly and brutally attacked innocent worshippers in a synagogue during their morning prayers. Obviously, we condemn in the strongest terms these attacks.  A number of people were wounded, and four people were killed, including three American citizens.  So this is a tragedy for both nations, Israel as well as the United States.  And our hearts go out to the families who obviously are undergoing enormous grief right now.

Secretary Kerry has spoken to Prime Minister Netanyahu.  President Abbas has strongly condemned the attacks.  Tragically, this is not the first loss of life that we have seen in recent months.  Too many Israelis have died.  Too many Palestinians have died.  And at this difficult time, I think it’s important for both Palestinians and Israelis to try to work together to lower tensions and to reject violence.

The murderers for today’s outrageous acts represent the kind of extremism that threatens to bring all of the Middle East into the kind of spiral from which it’s very difficult to emerge.  And we know how this violence can get worse over time.  But we have to remind ourselves that the majority of Palestinians and Israelis overwhelmingly want peace and to be able to raise their families knowing they’re safe and secure.  The United States wants to work with all parties involved to make that a reality, and to isolate the kind of extremists that are bringing about this terrible carnage.

I now want to turn to the topic of this meeting, the Ebola situation.  Obviously, some of the attention on the crisis has ebbed over the last several weeks, but the challenges remain.  We have seen most recently Dr. Martin Salia, a surgeon who contracted Ebola in Sierra Leone -- he was flown back to the United States, to the Nebraska facility, to try to get treated.  Unfortunately, he was already in critical condition, and, sadly, passed away early Monday morning.  So our thoughts and prayers are with his family.

Beyond this tragedy, though, we’ve established that when Ebola is promptly diagnosed and treated, then we have a great chance of curing it.  Of the eight patients who were treated promptly in the United States, all eight have recovered.  They are Ebola free and they are back with their families.

And after the first incident of Ebola in Dallas, and the unfortunate passing of Mr. Duncan, we promptly acted based on some of the lessons that were learned from Dallas.  We’ve put in place new protocols for protective gear for our health workers.  We ramped up our training and outreach for health workers.  We’ve added screening for travelers to the United States.  We’re funneling all these passengers into five airports.  And we put in place rules for public health workers to monitor travelers for 21 days after they arrive here.

As we saw in New York with Dr. Craig Spencer -- one of the courageous health workers who has voluntarily traveled to the region to try to fight this disease -- our efforts to identify, isolate, and then treat Ebola patients can work.  America has proven that it can handle the isolated cases that may occur here.

But as long as the outbreak continues to rage in the three countries in West Africa -- Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea -- this is still going to be a major -- not just for America, but for the entire world. 

We are nowhere near out of the woods yet in West Africa.  The good news is, in parts of Liberia, our efforts, both civilian and military, are really paying dividends, and we are seeing the curve bending so that we are on track, with diligence, dealing with the hotspots that may still reemerge, to actually get a handle on that disease. 

We’re still seeing an increase of cases in Sierra Leone, although our British counterparts are doing an excellent job working with us and the international community to coordinate the situation there.  In Guinea, the numbers are lower than in Sierra Leone or Liberia, but they’re often in very remote areas that are hard to reach, and some of the international coordination still needs to improve.

The bottom line, though, is that we know how to treat this disease given that it has emerged as such a large, significant outbreak in these areas, and we recently saw some cases in Mali. It underscores how important it is to continue to push forward until we stamp out this disease entirely in that region.  Until we do, there are threats of additional outbreaks.  And given the nature of international travel, it means that everybody has some measure of risk.

Here at home, we’ve made great progress in preparing our health care system to deal with any possible threat.  Our scientists continue to make progress with vaccines and treatments, but we’ve got plenty of work to do.

So all of this means that, although we should feel optimistic about our capacity to solve the Ebola crisis, we cannot be complacent simply because the news attention on it has waned.  We have to stay with it.  And that’s why I’m calling on Congress to make sure that it approves before it leaves the emergency funding request that we put forward to respond to Ebola, both domestically and internationally. 

The funding is going to help us strengthen our domestic health systems so that we can respond to any future cases that may arise in the United States wherever they might happen.  It’s going to devote much-needed resources to sustain our efforts in West Africa.  It will accelerate the testing and approval of Ebola vaccines and treatments.  And it’s going to help vulnerable countries to, in the future, prevent, detect, and respond to outbreaks of various communicable diseases before they become epidemics. 

And that, ultimately, is good for our public health.  The more we can catch these things early where they begin, the less risks we have over the long term.  And as I’ve said before, in some ways, we are lucky Ebola is a very difficult disease to transmit.  If we have a comparably lethal disease that is airborne, we have much bigger problems.  So this gives us an opportunity to start putting in place the kind of public health detection infrastructure around the globe that is necessary should additional pandemics or epidemics or outbreaks arise. 

All this makes it necessary for Congress to act.  This is not a Democratic issue; it is not a Republican issue -- this is a basic issue of the health and safety of the American people.  And so I hope that Congress is on the case on this issue before they leave.

Thank you very much, everybody.",President,Barack Obama,https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/the-press-office/2014/11/18/remarks-president-meeting-national-security-and-public-health-teams-ebol,,INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS
United Kingdom,24-Jan-11,David Cameron,Prime Minister's speech at the Nordic Baltic Summit,"A transcript of the speech and Q&A given by Prime Minister David Cameron in London on Thursday, 20 January 2011: I think it’s very clear we need to combine Lithuanian levels of internet access, Swedish education in computing code with Estonian levels e-government and e-commerce. Add to that Norwegian understanding of energy storage, Icelandic ability to encourage female participation, Finnish levels of childcare and family-friendliness. Add to that the Latvian ability to go from austerity to growth so rapidly with Danish expertise in renewable energy. If we wrapped all those things together I think we would genuinely create the good life. Of course, what would the British bring? Well, apart from a sense of generosity in recognising the strength of others, I hope a creativity and inventiveness, not least in the field of bringing people together to discuss these important ideas. So let me thank all Prime Ministers for coming to London, as well as the chairs, the facilitators and all the presenters and contributors. This has been a different kind of summit. No question of politicians being locked in a smoke-filled room, no sign of a boring pre-prepared communique telling us things we already know. Instead, this summit has been about generating and exchanging ideas, about challenging our preconceptions, about learning from each other’s experiences, how in these tough economic times do we boost jobs, enterprise and economic growth while promoting greater wellbeing and a higher quality of life for our citizens. And I believe today we have made good progress. I think one of the outcomes of this should be that so many of the ideas that we have talked about should be part of Europe’s growth agenda, whether it’s about green growth, about entrepreneurialism, about the digital economy, all of those issues need to be in the European programmes and I’m sure we’ll all drive that forward. First of all, today we’ve created a hugely valuable new network. Nine Prime Ministers from the UK, Nordic and Baltic countries have got together for the first time in our history. But this is about more than just government-to-government exchange. We’ve brought together for the first time politicians with policy experts, business leaders with thought leaders and also innovators and implementers. I hope that new relationships have been forged, new contacts made, ideas exchanged and debated. And while as governments we’re committed to supporting, cajoling and inspiring change, we want to see this new network take on a life of its own, embedding an entrepreneurial spirit right across our region. I’m pleased that to keep this network alive we will be putting in place some social media platforms for all participants to continue this discussion online and Fredrik Reinfeldt and I have been discussing how we may have a follow-up conference to this next year, possibly in Sweden, which I think would be hugely welcome given all the enthusiasm we’ve heard for what we’ve done in the last 24 hours. But a network like this must also have a clear purpose, and some people have asked me why I’ve convened this particular group of countries. But I think the answer is simple. We face similar economic and social challenges; we have a huge amount to learn from each other. The Nordic and Baltic countries have some of the most high-tech, innovative companies, some of the most radical approaches to delivering public services and some of the best ideas about how to improve general wellbeing and quality of life. So yes, I want to see action on economic reform by Europe as a whole, on trade, on regulation, the single market, on innovation, but I believe the UK, Nordic and Baltic countries can be the avant-garde, can be in the guard’s van of delivering jobs and growth. So let me focus briefly on a couple of the ideas that have emerged from our discussions. First, trade. We’re all agreed that increasing trade is the biggest boost that we can give to our economies, and make no mistake the economic climate we face today is tough, but it’s precisely because of those pressures that we must trade more with each other. Trade between the United Kingdom, Nordic and Baltic countries is already £54 billion a year, roughly the same as UK trade with China, but following a very successful trade event held yesterday where companies such as wind-turbine business Vestas will create 400 new jobs in Britain and where energy-company Vattenfall will be opening up the new headquarters in London, I can also announce that Infomentor and Arla Foods have announced investments into the UK, and there’s one more concrete step forward that I can announce today, and that is that Britain’s new trade minister, Lord Green, will be taking a trade mission of business people and investors to the Nordic and Baltic region and will set up a taskforce to boost our trade links. Trade, however, is only half of the story; to generate sustainable growth and improve our society’s wellbeing, we acknowledge today that we must do things differently. We have to innovate. This is partly the responsibility of governments and we heard about some great government initiatives today. From the e-government and digital initiatives we have heard about from Estonia; the policies to improve equality in the workforce like the ideas on workforce participation and paid parental leave from Norway; ways to encourage enterprise such as innovative approaches to unemployment benefit that we have heard about from Iceland, or the vocational training in Denmark that you are putting in place for young people. All in all, the ideas we have heard today give us, I believe, as Prime Ministers and as heads of government, real food for thought. However, there is a crucial role for business and for society too. For example, from Finland we have heard about groundbreaking technology initiatives like the Nokia Innovation Mill which converts thousands of unused innovations into new start-up companies. In Lithuania they have got the world’s second largest producer of apps, and on the green agenda we have heard a lot about smart grids, of which Sweden is amongst the most advanced countries. We have been inspired by ideas from Latvia where entrepreneurial organisations are already taking over the delivery of some previously state services. So there are a huge amount of ideas coming not from government, but from businesses, from civil society, from NGOs, from think tanks, and elsewhere. To help us follow up and to make sure these ideas are built on, I am grateful to the three think tanks that have been taking part today: Policy Exchange, Reform and the RSA; they have agreed to work with our chairs to bring together the points from today and recommend ways forward.",Prime Minister,David Cameron,https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/prime-ministers-speech-at-the-nordic-baltic-summit,,DEVELOPMENT
China,02-10-2021 00:00,H.E. Wang Yi,Global Vision and Firm Commitment as a Major Country,"This year marks the 75th anniversary of victory in the World Anti-Fascist War and the founding of the United Nations (UN). It is a year commemorable to all countries around the world. However, the sudden onslaught of COVID-19 has brought unprecedented shocks, accelerated the evolution of the international landscape and created many uncertainties for the future of humanity. Faced with the crisis, most countries have called for greater solidarity and cooperation. Yet a certain country is going against this overwhelming trend, putting its own interests first and pursuing a beggar-thy-neighbor approach; it is even provoking hostility and division. Where is the world headed in the next 75 years? This is the question on the mind of all countries.

At such a critical juncture on which hinges the future of humanity, President Xi Jinping has recorded video messages for a series of important video conferences, including the High-level Meeting to Commemorate the 75th Anniversary of the UN, the General Debate of the 75th Session of the UN General Assembly, the Summit on Biodiversity, and the High-level Meeting on the 25th Anniversary of the Fourth World Conference on Women. Following his attendance at the high-level meetings marking the 70th anniversary of the UN in 2015 and his speech at the UN Office at Geneva in 2017, this is the third time President Xi has spoken at the UN and given China's voice, solution and proposition at the world's most important multilateral platform.

In his important statements, President Xi, with a keen understanding of the times and the world and taking account of the long-term, common interests of humanity, provided comprehensive and systematic answers to such key questions as what kind of a world humanity will face in the post-COVID era, what role China will play in the world and what kind of an international order we all need. He took a clear stand and unequivocally reiterated China's firm commitment to multilateralism, the authority of the UN, the path of peaceful development and mutually beneficial cooperation, and the vision of building a community with a shared future for mankind. His important statements, demonstrating the global vision and firm commitment of China as a major country, have been welcomed and highly regarded by the international community. It is widely agreed that President Xi's statements and proposals will have positive and far-reaching impact on the evolution of the international landscape, both now and in the future. To be more specific:

First, new impetus has been injected into the global COVID-19 response.

COVID-19 is a global public health crisis to confront humanity since World War II. International solidarity is much needed in overcoming it. Against this backdrop, President Xi put forward a range of important initiatives and proposals and demonstrated a strong sense of responsibility for the wellbeing of humanity.

First, sharing China's experience. China was among the first to stem the spread of the coronavirus and reopen the economy. In this process, we have gained much experience and developed practices that could be of useful reference to other countries.

President Xi elaborated on China's experience in fighting COVID-19, including its people-first, life-first commitment, science-based approach and well-calibrated measures. According to many countries, China's experience, gained through extraordinary efforts, has been proven effective in practice, and reinforced their confidence and strength in defeating the virus.

Second, making China's initiatives. President Xi underscored the imperative of solidarity and partnership in the face of such a grim challenge. He urged fully leveraging the crucial leadership role of the World Health Organization (WHO), pursuing collaborative responses across national borders, and opposing politicization and stigmatization.

He proposed that comprehensive and normalized response measures be instituted to restore economic and social activity and vitality in an orderly way. President Xi also drew attention to the needs of developing countries, especially African countries, and called for timely and robust measures in debt relief and international assistance.

Third, fulfilling China's responsibility. China both advocates and more importantly, actively pursues global cooperation against COVID-19. Under the personal direction of President Xi, China engaged in a biggest-ever global humanitarian action in the history of the People's Republic, and provided assistance to countries in need to the best of its ability.

In addressing the 73rd World Health Assembly last May, President Xi announced China's five major initiatives in support of global COVID-19 response. We are making steady progress in the vaccine development. Once available and deployed, the vaccines will be made a global public good and provided to developing countries on a priority basis, as a concrete step in fulfilling China's earnest commitment.

Second, new consensus has been forged on the reform of the global governance system.

In the world today, unilateralism is undercutting the international order and bullyism challenging the norms governing international relations, presenting real threats and challenges to world peace and stability. The global governance system needs to be reformed and brought up to date - this is a task of our times that we in the global community must take on.

China is a founding member of the UN that was the first to put its signature on the UN Charter. It has also been a firm supporter of multilateralism. How China views global governance and what position it takes is of great interest to all parties. President Xi set out China's views on this subject in an all-round fashion, with a dialectical perspective on what should remain unchanged and what should be changed in today's global governance system.

What should remain unchanged? The purposes and principles of the UN Charter and the pursuit of multilateralism. President Xi stressed the UN has stood one test after another, and the UN Charter remains an important guarantee for world peace and development.

Addressing the concern about the world fracturing into two separate systems, President Xi pointed out that there is but one system in the world, and it is the UN-centered international system; there is but one set of rules, and it is the basic norms governing international relations underpinned by the UN Charter.

These important statements set the tone for the reform of the global governance system. All countries need to follow a constructive approach to improve and strengthen the existing system. Self-conceit and arbitrary withdrawal from international treaties and organizations are not helpful, still less creating divisions, seclusion or decoupling.

Where do we need change? As the times evolve, we need to enhance international coordination to tackle the ever-increasing global challenges and threats. And we also need to seek shared benefits through cooperation and consultation, and better reflect the collective rise of developing countries, which has become a fact to be reckoned with in international politics.

President Xi called on the UN to stand firm for justice, uphold the rule of law, promote cooperation and focus on real action. These four propositions epitomize the great expectations of the global community on the UN. President Xi stressed that no country has the right to dominate global affairs, control the destiny of others, or keep advantages in development all to itself. Even less should one be allowed to do whatever it likes or practice exceptionalism or double standards. He also underscored that priority should be given to addressing non-traditional security challenges such as public health, the issue of development should be highlighted in the global macro framework, and the representation and voice of developing countries in the UN should be increased.

People with a sense of justice can easily tell right from wrong. President Xi's resounding statements struck a chord with the majority of the international community, and charted the right course for reforming the global governance system.

Third, new proposals have been put forth for global economic recovery.

COVID-19 has plunged the world economy into the most serious recession since World War II, and taken a heavy toll on the economic and social development of all countries. Moreover, the backlash against globalization and rise of protectionism has aggravated the global downturn, and posed severe challenges to development. At this critical moment, President Xi made the following proposals to effectively remove the main obstacles holding back global recovery and development.

- Commitment to openness and integration. The march of the humanity toward openness and integration is unstoppable. Economic globalization is as much a historical trend as an indisputable reality. As illustrated by President Xi, burying one's head in the sand like an ostrich in the face of economic globalization or trying to fight it with Don Quixote's lance goes against the trend of history. We should remain committed to building an open world economy, uphold the multilateral trading regime with the World Trade Organization as the cornerstone, and work to ensure the stable and smooth functioning of global industrial and supply chains. These powerful statements demonstrate China's vision and sense of responsibility to forge ahead against all odds and charted the future course for the world economy.

- Commitment to win-win cooperation. President Xi encouraged countries to see each other as members of the same big family, pursue win-win cooperation and the common interests of all as each work to safeguard its own interests, and expand the converging interests of all. He underlined that China will not pursue development behind closed doors. Rather, it aims to foster, over time, a new development paradigm with domestic circulation as the mainstay and domestic and international circulations reinforcing each other. Consistent with the trend of peace, development and cooperation, these statements reflected China's openness and readiness to share its huge market with the rest of the world, and projected its image as a responsible country promoting win-win cooperation through real actions.

- Commitment to reform and innovation. The progress of human society is always achieved through overcoming difficulties and challenges with constant reform and innovation. President Xi stressed that we should not dodge the challenges of economic globalization. Instead, we must strike a proper balance between the government and the market, fairness and efficiency, growth and income distribution, and technology and employment so as to make sure that development delivers benefit to people from all countries, sectors and backgrounds in an equitable way. President Xi made many important observations on the new round of scientific and technological revolution and industrial transformation and the transition to green and low-carbon development. He also called on all countries to pursue innovative, coordinated, green and open development for all. All this has pointed the way forward for the sound and sustained growth of the world economy.

Fourth, a new benchmark has been set for promoting global ecological progress.

Turning the Earth into our beautiful homeland is a responsibility shared by all humanity. Since the start of this year, the world has been struck by frequent natural disasters and the COVID-19 pandemic. It once again prompts us to reflect on the relationship between man and Nature.

In his statements, President Xi made the appeal that humankind should launch a green revolution and move faster to create a green way of development and life. He put forward four proposals, namely, increase the drive for building a beautiful world, build synergy for global governance on the environment, increase the potential for high-quality economic recovery after COVID-19, and strengthen the power of action to tackle challenges to the environment. These insightful views and important announcements have contributed to the promotion of global ecological progress.

China attaches great importance to building an ecological civilization, and stands committed to pursuing the path of green, low-carbon and sustainable development. Guided by the philosophy that lucid waters and lush mountains are more precious than mountains of gold and silver, we are making solid progress toward building a beautiful China.

In 2019, China's carbon dioxide emissions per unit of GDP dropped by 48.1% from the 2005 level, and the share of non-fossil fuel in primary energy consumption reached 15.3%. Annual investment in renewable energy had exceeded 100 billion dollars for five years in a row, and the stock of new energy vehicles in China accounted for over half of the world's total.

China also tops the world in the expansion of forest cover. With more than 70 million hectares of land afforested in the last ten years, China has put in place ""green Great Walls"" to protect people's homes and turned deserts into oases, creating one miracle after another.

From the conclusion of the Paris Agreement to the full implementation of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, and from promoting green cooperation under the Belt and Road Initiative to engaging in global ecological and environmental governance, China has all along committed itself to building a clean and beautiful world.

In recent years, while fulfilling its international obligations to high standards, China has continuously set for itself new goals and made new commitments one after another. In his statements, President Xi solemnly announced that having met its 2020 climate action targets two years ahead of schedule, China will scale up its nationally determined contributions, adopt even more forceful policies and measures, and strive to peak carbon dioxide emissions before 2030 and achieve carbon neutrality before 2060. These ambitious targets have shown to the world that China is firmly committed to the new development philosophy and stands ready to make new contributions to global climate response. President Xi's major policy announcements have been widely commended by the international community.

Fifth, new impetus has been given to the global cause of women's development.

In his address to the UN high-level meeting on the occasion of the 25th anniversary of the Fourth World Conference on Women in Beijing and the fifth anniversary of the Global Leaders' Meeting on Gender Equality and Women's Empowerment, President Xi shared a heart-stirring story of a medical worker, one of the many great Chinese women who have made outstanding contribution to China's battle against COVID-19.

The reason why Chinese women play an important role in driving the country's development is because the Communist Party of China and the Chinese government always value and support women's development. In the past 70-plus years since the founding of the People's Republic of China, gender equality has been made into a basic state policy. The status of women has been notably improved, and remarkable progress has been achieved in women's development. China has put in place a legal system for fully protecting women's rights and interests, and is recognized by the WHO as one of the ten fast-track countries in women's and children's health.

Over the past decades, women's development in China has also been a unique contribution to the global cause of women. Noting the challenges facing women's development globally, President Xi called for efforts to minimize the impact of COVID-19 on women, strive for genuine gender equality, ensure that women advance at the forefront of our times, and enhance global cooperation in advancing women's development. He also proposed to hold in 2025 another Global Leaders' Meeting on Gender Equality and Women's Empowerment.

President Xi's insightful views have demonstrated China's vision on and commitment to women's development, and will chart the course for the all-round development of women.

Sixth, a new sense of responsibility has been demonstrated in support of the core role of the UN.

The UN belongs to the people of the whole world. It serves all countries and at the same time, relies on the support from all parties. As a permanent member of the UN Security Council, China always firmly supports the UN and provides the world with public goods. It is the second largest contributor to the UN regular budget and peacekeeping budget; it has dispatched more than 40,000 peacekeepers over the past three decades, more than any other permanent member of the Security Council.

The major initiatives and the measures that President Xi announced at the high-level meetings marking the 70th anniversary of the UN in 2015 have all been executed. Among others, the Peace and Development Trust Fund between the UN and China, supported as many as 52 projects between 2016 and 2019 in the peace and security field alone. UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres spoke highly of China's support and the role it plays, noting that it is thanks to China's support that the UN is better-positioned to perform its duties.

At this year's General Assembly, President Xi announced a set of new initiatives and measures, including: providing US$50 million to the UN COVID-19 Global Humanitarian Response Plan, and US$50 million to the China-FAO South-South Cooperation Trust Fund (Phase III); extending the Peace and Development Trust Fund between the UN and China by five years after it expires in 2025; donating another US$10 million to UN Women in the coming five years; and setting up a UN Global Geospatial Knowledge and Innovation Center and an International Research Center of Big Data for Sustainable Development Goals. These initiatives are part of China's proactive efforts to advance global peace and development. They are also the solid actions taken by China to support multilateralism.

The new statements and proposals by President Xi at this year's General Assembly further enriched and expanded Xi Jinping Thought on Diplomacy in both theory and practice. Five years ago, President Xi outlined the pathway for building a community with a shared future for mankind from five aspects at the 70th Session of the UN General Assembly. Three years ago, he further expounded on the overall design for shaping a better world along five lines of efforts at the UN Office at Geneva. At this year's General Assembly, he summed up four important lessons that COVID-19 reminds the international community as people reflect on epidemic response.

These three important addresses at the UN have enriched the theoretical framework on building a community with a shared future for mankind, and guided the innovation in theory and practice of our major-country diplomacy with Chinese characteristics. They constitute important components of Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era and Xi Jinping Thought on Diplomacy. With their theoretical and epoch-making significance, they will provide a powerful intellectual boost to China's diplomatic work in the future.

Change is the constant of the world. Although we live at a momentous time of profound changes unseen in a century, we still believe that no matter what difficulties and obstacles may lie ahead, the pursuit of the Chinese nation for rejuvenation will not be stopped, the just cause of multilateralism will not be halted, and the prevailing trend of peace and development in the world will not be reversed.

All members of the Chinese diplomatic service will continue to rally closely around the CPC Central Committee with Comrade Xi Jinping at its core, earnestly implement Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era, work proactively to advance major-country diplomacy with Chinese characteristics in the new era, and make greater contributions to the building of a community with a shared future for mankind with all countries.",State Councilor and Foreign Minister of the People's Republic of China,Xi Jinping,https://www.fmprc.gov.cn/mfa_eng/wjdt_665385/zyjh_665391/t1821549.shtml,,INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS
USA,16-04-2021 00:00,Joe Biden,"Statement from President Joe Biden on the Mass Shooting in Indianapolis, Indiana","Vice President Harris and I have been briefed by our homeland security team on the mass shooting at a FedEx facility in Indianapolis, Indiana, where a lone gunman murdered eight people and wounded several more in the dark of night. 
 
Today’s briefing is just the latest in a string of tragedies, following closely after gunmen firing bullets in broad day light at spas in and around Atlanta, Georgia, a grocery store in Boulder, Colorado, a home in Rock Hill, South Carolina, and so many other shootings. 
 
While we await critical details about the shooting, its motivation, and other key information, once again, I have the solemn duty of ordering the flag lowered at half-staff at the White House, public buildings and grounds, and military posts and embassies, just two weeks after I gave the last such order.
 
It’s a mass shooting just a week after we met, in the Rose Garden, with families who lost children and dear friends as bullets pierced their bodies and souls in schools, a night club, in a car at a gas station, and a town meeting at a grocery store. And it came just the night before 14th anniversary of the shooting at Virginia Tech, in which a gunman murdered 32 people.
 
Last night and into the morning in Indianapolis, yet again families had to wait to hear word about the fate of their loved ones. What a cruel wait and fate that has become too normal and happens every day somewhere in our nation.
 
Gun violence is an epidemic in America. But we should not accept it. We must act.
 
Last week, I called on the Justice Department to better protect Americans from gun violence.  I also urged Congress to hear the call of the American people – including the vast majority of gun owners – to enact commonsense gun violence prevention legislation, like universal background checks and a ban of weapons of war and high-capacity magazines.
 
Too many Americans are dying every single day from gun violence. It stains our character and pierces the very soul of our nation.
 
We can, and must, do more to act and to save lives.
 
God bless the eight fellow Americans we lost in Indianapolis and their loved ones, and we pray for the wounded for their recovery.",President,Joe Biden,https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/04/16/statement-from-president-joe-biden-on-the-mass-shooting-in-indianapolis-indiana/,,EXTREMISM
USA,12-07-2014,Barack Obama,"
Weekly Address: Expanding Opportunity – It’s Time for Congressional Republicans to Do Their Part"," Hi, everybody.  This week, I spent some time in Colorado and Texas, talking with people about what’s going on in their lives. 

One of them was Elizabeth Cooper, who’ll be a college junior this fall.  She wrote to tell me something I hear often: how hard it is for middle-class families like hers to afford college.  And she shared something I know many of you feel when you wonder what’s going on in Washington.  She said she feels “not significant enough to be addressed, not poor enough for people to worry [about], and not rich enough to be cared about.”

I ran for President to fight for Americans just like Elizabeth – people who work hard, do everything right, and just want a chance to build a decent life for themselves and their families.

And after the worst economic crisis in generations, our businesses have now created nearly 10 million new jobs over the past 52 months.  The unemployment rate has fallen to its lowest point since 2008.  By almost every measure, our economy is better off than it was five years ago.

But while we’ve created more jobs at this point of the year than any year since 1999, too many families barely earn what they did in 1999.  It’s harder to pay for college, save, or retire, because people’s wages and incomes have not gone up.  Nearly all the gains of the recovery are going to the very top – and aren’t making a difference in your lives. 

And I believe America does better when the middle class does better.  And I’ve laid out an opportunity agenda to create jobs, train workers, educate our kids, and make sure hard work actually pays off.

These are the things we should be doing to grow the middle class and help folks work their way into the middle class.  And it’s pretty uncontroversial stuff. I hope we can work together on it.  And I’m always willing to compromise if folks have other ideas or if it advances generally the interests of working Americans.

But so far this year, Republicans in Congress have blocked every serious idea to strengthen the middle class.  Lifting the minimum wage, fair pay, student loan reform – they’ve said no to all of it.  And that’s when I’ve acted this year to help working Americans on my own– when Congress won’t act. 

I’ve taken actions to attract new jobs, lift workers’ wages, help students pay off their loans, and more.  And the Republican plan right now is not to do some of this work with me – instead, it’s to sue me.  That’s actually what they’re spending their time on.  It’s a political stunt that’s going to waste months of America’s time.  And by the way, they’re going to pay for it using your hard-earned tax dollars.

I have a better idea: do something, Congress.  Do anything to help working Americans.  Join the rest of the country. Join me, I'm looking forward to working with you.

You know, on Tuesday, I met with Carolyn Reed and her husband David, who own six Silver Mine Sub shops in Colorado.  Two days later, they announced they’re giving their hourly employees a raise to ten dollars and ten cents an hour. 

They’re not waiting for Congress.  Carolyn said, “We are happy to be a part of what I hope will be a growing voluntary trend in increased wages.”

Carolyn and Americans like her all across the country are happy to do their part.  Congress now needs to step up and do its part.  And next week, I’ll travel to a couple of job sites to talk about how Democrats and Republicans can work together to grow the economy and protect nearly 700,000 jobs by passing a highway bill by the end of the summer.

I’m here because hardworking Americans like Elizabeth and Carolyn.  That’s something I’ll never forget – it's something I’ll never stop fighting for.  Thanks, and have a great weekend.",President,Barack Obama,https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/the-press-office/2014/07/12/weekly-address-expanding-opportunity-it-s-time-congressional-republicans,,DEVELOPMENT
Russia,10-05-2016 00:00,Vladimir Putin,Vladimir Putin addressed State Duma,"Members of the State Duma, friends,

It gives me great pleasure to welcome you and congratulate you on the opening of the seventh convocation of the State Duma.

Today in this hall, we have representatives of all the 85 Russian regions, including those elected in Crimea and Sevastopol.

Our citizens have entrusted you with the distinguished title of a Parliament Member. The election campaign was transparent and the competition was honest. The results demonstrate the will and choice of Russian society. I see a guarantee of the legislative branch’s strength and authority in the absolute legitimacy of the parliament.

The role of the State Duma as a representative body has significantly increased. Half of the mandates were given to candidates directly elected by residents of specific areas, districts and regions.

Overall, the composition of the State Duma has changed markedly. Representatives of public, professional and local organisations have joined it. I believe that as a result, Parliament will be receiving more efficient feedback from the voters, the civil society and the regions, which means a better quality of legislative work.

I also expect that the State Duma will be cooperating more closely with everybody who has the right to legislative initiative, including regional parliaments, and will frequently practice preliminary readings and public hearings, including with participation of the parties not sitting in Parliament.

I would like to stress that effective laws are not only a result of impeccable legal work, which is, of course, very important. The parliament’s decisions must be based on civil accord. Therefore, the State Duma must become a regular platform for an extensive public and political dialogue.

Colleagues,

During the election campaign, people expressed a demand for substantial social and economic changes. There is intensive and important work ahead for you as legislators and you must start immediately.

You can always count on the President’s support, on my support and on the closest interaction with the Russian Government. The ability of the branches of power to efficiently work together has key importance for our common success.

In order to set the economy on a growth trajectory, we need to remove legislative obstacles that curb the competitiveness, investment flows and the introduction of cutting edge technologies, and to provide a balanced development of Russian regions, the northern and Far Eastern areas.

Draft laws to support entrepreneurship and private initiative will be submitted to the State Duma. In particular, they will concern greater legislative protection of businesses from pressure by unscrupulous – unfortunately, they exist – employees of law enforcement agencies.

I would like to direct your attention to the key issue. What is this issue? Of course, special attention should be paid to reaching objectives in education, healthcare, housing policy and the environment. That is, in areas that directly influence people’s wellbeing and social and demographic development.

We launch priority projects in order to concentrate our efforts and resources on solving the most pressing tasks in the economy and social sphere. I will ask you to promptly provide them with a legislative framework, and while working with the federal budget to make sure that the priority projects are financed in full.

Of course, we must enhance the country’s security and defense capability, and defend its position on the global stage as well. I count on the political and legislative support of all the parliamentary parties.

I also consider it important that the resources of parliamentary democracy are used in full to develop substantial international relations with all interested partners.

Friends,

Russian society expects thorough and professional work from you, a deep understanding of the importance of law, and willingness to fight for the interests of the state and the nation.

I would like to address representatives of all the parliamentary parties. There have always been and will always be political disagreements. This is life, but the status of a people’s representative and the authority of the parliament, responsibility for the fate of the country and its citizens are above any personal or party ambitions.

This is how members of the sixth convocation worked in solidarity when making the most principled and, without exaggeration, life-changing decisions for Russia.

In the past years, the Russian Parliament has made a huge step in its development. It has become more professional and responsible. We have ensured an open and honest dialogue between various political forces.

I would like to thank once again the former deputies and former Speaker, Sergei Naryshkin, for their productive and efficient work.

I am confident that there will be continuity. I expect that the newly elected Deputies will improve on the best achievements of their predecessors and, of course, will preserve the historical legacy of the Russian parliamentary system.

More than a hundred years ago, Petr Stolypin said when addressing the State Duma, “We must bring together all our efforts, all our obligations and rights to support Russia’s historically supreme right to be strong.” Whether we cite these words or put them in a different form, we must always assume that any nation and any country have exactly the same right, to be strong.

One more thing. We never use the word “strength” to imply superpower ambitions. We can never impose anything on anybody. Russia’s strength is within us, within our people, our traditions and culture, our economy, our huge territory and natural resources. It is in our defence power, of course. However, most importantly, our strength is in the unity of our people.

We must always remember that all the components of Russia’s strength that I have just mentioned are the most important conditions for preserving our statehood, independence and existence as a shared home for all the peoples living here.

I wish the State Duma members of the seventh convocation and the new Parliament leadership success in serving the Russian nation.

Thank you.",President,Vladimir Putin,http://en.kremlin.ru/events/president/transcripts/statements/53027,,OTHERS
United Kingdom,13-Aug-10,David Cameron,"PM's speech at Sovereign's Parade, Sandhurst","Prime Minister It’s a huge privilege for me to be here with you today. As Prime Minister I come into contact with our armed forces a great deal. Whether visiting Afghanistan, going round bases in the UK, or meeting with our top officers for briefings as part of our new National Security Council. And I just have to tell you this. There is nothing that makes me more proud of our country, of what we stand for in the world, or what we’re capable of doing, than our armed forces. So to share this moment of celebration for 226 young men and women and their families and friends, makes this a very special day for me. Sandhurst is one of the greatest training institutions in the world. Today there are 21 officers being commissioned from 13 countries From Afghanistan to Yemen, from Rwanda to Bahrain From China to Kosovo, to Swaziland and the United States of America. And we’re very proud that you’ve all come here for your training. And as newly commissioned officers, you are all following in the footsteps of nearly 200 years of history. The first intake of cadets who started here in 1812 included people who went on to fight at the battle of Waterloo. Within twelve months many of you can expect to be on operations yourselves. There will be huge challenges ahead. But as you leave here today, I hope you will take three things with you. First, pride in what you have achieved. Second, pride in the Army you’re going to join And third, pride in what you are going to do. Let me take each in turn. Pride in what you’ve achieved You’ve been through 44 weeks of the toughest and the best training that anyone could have. Outwardly you are fitter, leaner and stronger. Inwardly more confident, more sure of your abilities and your own limits. Of course, you’ll all have many memories of your time here. Just yesterday I spoke to the Crown Prince of Abu Dhabi who said how much he missed being here. Many have passed out of here and risen to great prominence. There’s a story I like about one who it’s said was sent by his Sergeant Major to march down the King’s Walk to apologise to Queen Victoria’s statue for being such an idle officer on drill. After which the young cadet was seen marching back to his college and not to the drill square. When he was summoned back - the young cadet responded that Her Majesty had accepted his apology but had observed that he had looked rather tired and that he should go and get some rest! This is an incredibly tough place to succeed. And rightly so. Many don’t make it. Half of those who apply here don’t get accepted in the first place. Nearly a sixth of those who pass in, don’t pass out. It’s a great testament to the strength and endurance of those of you here today. The army advert says “be the best” And that’s exactly what you are. And you should take pride in that. Pride in the army you’re going to join The second thing I want you to take away is pride in the army you’re going to join. For the Brits among you - you are quite simply becoming part of the army with the greatest history in the world. You will have studied the tactics of soldiers in battles from Agincourt to Allemagne. Tales of bravery that ring out through the centuries. I know you will follow in that tradition. I can see that today because of what our forces have done and are doing in Afghanistan. In my generation alone I’ve seen the Army deployed in Northern Ireland, the Falklands, the Balkans, West Africa, Iraq and Afghanistan. Each of which has posed different challenges, but in each of which our men and women have served with great distinction. But the secret of success I believe is this: That despite the technology of today, an army is an intensely human business, based on personal relationships and the ability of young newly commissioned officers to lead men and women in the face of danger. There’s no greater honour that a nation can bestow than the trust to lead your fellow men and women. And that is the task you will have. Pride in what you’re going to do So the third thing I want you to take away is pride in what you’re going to do. The challenges you face over the coming years will place demands on you experienced by few others of your age in the world today. Many of you will be deployed to Afghanistan. Whenever I visit Afghanistan, I’m struck not just by the incredible bravery of our soldiers, but by everything else they have to do. They’re superb athletes, fantastically fit and able. They are technically competent. Because the equipment now is far more complicated than anything previous generations have had. And they’re also diplomats, because this is not about two armies facing each other. It is a war amongst the people. It’s about handling all sorts of difficult situations as you work with the local people. From the village shura, to the local army and police. Your training here has given you the best possible start. You will need to continue to develop all these skills and more. But I want you to be proud of the difference that you can make. The security of our nation - and that of our allies across the world - is at stake. If we leave Afghanistan now, Al Qaeda will again use Afghanistan as a base from which to attack the West. I say - we cannot let that happen. But it’s what you will do that will actually prevent it. You will be helping to defend our way of life. And there is no greater calling than that. Your country will have pride in you And in return for all you will give to your country, I want your country to have pride in you. As a government we will do everything we can to support you, to look after your families and to rebuild the Military Covenant that is so important to this Government - and I believe this country. First and foremost that means supporting you. People expect us to do the right thing by you. And we will.

China,17-04-2010 00:00,Hu Jintao,Cooperation and Openness for Mutual Benefit and Win-Win Progress ,"President Lula da Silva,

Dear Colleagues,

It gives me great pleasure to join you again in the beautiful city of Brasilia. Let me begin by expressing sincere thanks to President Lula and the Brazilian government for the thoughtful arrangements they have made for this meeting.

When we met in Yekaterinburg last June, the world economy was in the quagmire of the international financial crisis. Major economies ran into recession, and the work and life of people around the world were seriously affected. In the face of a gloomy economic picture, the four BRIC countries came together and sent a strong message that we would work for the early recovery of the world economy. Through hard efforts, we became the first to achieve an economic turnaround. And thanks to the concerted efforts of the international community, the world economy has shown signs of recovery and is expected to gradually emerge from the financial crisis.

At the same time, we must realize that the world economic recovery is not yet firmly established or balanced, and there are still many uncertainties down the road. We have seen recently the rise of sovereign debt risks in some countries, fluctuations in international financial markets, surging protectionism of various forms and grave employment situation in some parts of the world. Global challenges such as climate change, food security, energy and resource security, public health security and major natural disasters are intertwined, and the deep-seated problems in world economic governance structure are yet to be addressed. In short, there is still a long way to go before the world economy can achieve sustainable growth.

Dear Colleagues,

Over the past year, we have broadened the scope and increased the levels of dialogue and cooperation among our four countries, and our efforts have produced fruitful results. Our four countries differ in political system, development model, religious belief and cultural tradition, but we have become good friends and partners. This shows that countries with different social systems can be inclusive toward each other and countries with different development models can engage in cooperation. It also shows that different civilizations can learn from each other and different cultures can have exchanges. Our endeavor is in keeping with the trend towards peace and development and answers the call of our time for cooperation and mutual benefit.

“BRIC” cooperation now faces both valuable opportunities and severe challenges. We should set clear objectives for cooperation among the four countries and advance the BRIC cooperation process from a strategic height. We should base our cooperation on political mutual trust, and treat each other with sincerity, mutual respect, mutual understanding and mutual support. We should focus on practical cooperation and make our cooperation more dynamic through concrete actions. We should strengthen institutional building to support increased cooperation in broader areas. We should aim for mutual benefit by combining our respective strengths and sharing the fruits of cooperation to the fullest extent. We should view openness and transparency as the prerequisite of our cooperation and strengthen communication and exchanges to make our cooperation an open process.

Dear Colleagues,

The international situation is now very complex, and the global pattern is undergoing profound readjustment. No matter how the international situation may evolve and what changes the international system may experience, we should remain firmly committed to the goal of mutual benefit, the principle of democracy and equity, the approach of mutual respect and the spirit of solidarity and cooperation.

We should encourage all parties to firm up the foundation of the world economic recovery and strengthen macroeconomic policy coordination. The international community coordinated the “entry” strategy in response to the financial crisis, and we must also act in coordination with respect to the “exit” strategy and maintain the continuity and stability of macroeconomic policies.

We should encourage all parties to address imbalances in the global economic governance structure. It is important to achieve on schedule the quantified reform targets of international financial institutions set by the G20 Pittsburgh Summit and increase the representation and voice of emerging markets and developing countries.

We should encourage all parties to continue to promote trade liberalization and facilitation, properly handle trade disputes and reject protectionism. The main parties to the Doha Round negotiations should demonstrate sincerity and flexibility to reach comprehensive and balanced outcomes at an early date and facilitate the establishment of an open and mutually-beneficial multilateral trade regime.

We should encourage all parties to improve the international financial supervisory and regulatory regime by expanding its scope, specifying responsibilities, adopting universally accepted standards and norms and strengthening mechanisms. There should be supervision over the macroeconomic policies of major reserve currency issuing economies and over sovereign credit rating agencies.

We should encourage all parties to embrace a stronger sense of responsibility and morality and work for balanced global development. It is important to scale up input in development and ensure development resources and at the same time respect each other’s development model chosen in the light of national conditions and policy space. In September, the United Nations will hold the High-level Meeting on the Millennium Development Goals. We need to urge the international community, particularly developed countries, to honor commitments in increased assistance, debt relief, market access and technology transfer and help developing countries promote economic growth, improve people’s well-being and meet the Millennium Development Goals.

To maintain and advance dialogue and cooperation among BRIC countries, China would like to host the third BRIC Summit.

Dear Colleagues,

China has scored notable achievements over the past 30-odd years since reform and opening-up. Now many people are interested to know what kind of a country China is likely to be in the future. What will it say and what will it do? How is it going to treat old friends and how is it going to treat new friends? Let me share with you, in this connection, the following observations.

First, China’s development is a long and arduous task. China is the world’s biggest developing country. A large population, a weak foundation and uneven development: these are the basic realities confronting us. China has 1.3 billion people. Our per capita GDP has just exceeded US$3,000, trailing behind more than 100 countries. According to UN standard, we still have over 100 million people living below the poverty line. It is truly a heavy task to grow the economy and improve people’s livelihood in China. The scale and complexity of the challenges that we face in the course of development are unmatched anywhere else in the world and have been rarely seen in human history. To achieve modernization and ensure a prosperous life for all our people, we must make persistent efforts for a long time to come.

Second, peaceful development is China’s only and logical choice. The Chinese people love peace. It is our long-cherished tradition to foster harmony and build amicable ties with neighbors. China’s development will not bring harm or pose a threat to anyone. We advocate and follow the principle of “do not do onto others what you do not want others to do onto you”. The Chinese people suffered so much in modern history, and we therefore value peace, stability, harmony and freedom more than anything else. China is committed to the path of peaceful development. A prosperous and growing China dedicated to peace and cooperation is willing and able to make new and even greater contribution to mankind’s pursuit of peace and development.

Third, China’s development is an inclusive, win-win process. China pursues a win-win strategy of opening-up and seeks to promote common development of all countries through mutually-beneficial cooperation. Guided by the basic state policy of opening-up, we have been endeavoring to develop an open economy, increase import, actively use foreign investment, implement the FTA strategy at a faster pace, push forward regional economic integration, and share with other countries the benefits of expanding markets and deepening division of labor. China has taken an active part in the international cooperation to counter the global financial crisis ever since it broke out. We have sent many trade and investment promotion missions and large procurement missions abroad. China has made great efforts to support and help developing countries. We have cancelled the debts owed by 49 heavily indebted poor countries and least developed countries and offered zero-tariff treatment to commodities from more than 40 least developed countries. Last November, we announced eight new measures in support of Africa’s sustainable development. These measures will help expand China’s trade with and investment in Africa, intensify practical cooperation between the two sides, build up Africa’s capacity to achieve self-development, and strengthen our joint endeavor to counter the global financial crisis.

Fourth, China follows a responsible approach in pursuing development. The year 2009 was the most difficult year for the Chinese economy since the beginning of the new century. The global financial crisis led to a sharp decline in China’s export, a big increase in unemployment and a slowdown in economic growth. Confronted with such a situation, we gave top priority to maintaining steady and relatively fast economic growth, and fully implemented and steadily improved our package plan and policy measures in response to the financial crisis. Thanks to these efforts, we achieved an 8.7 percent GDP growth and made important contribution to the world economic recovery. To ensure steady and relatively fast growth, we have taken it as an important task to speed up the transformation of growth pattern and economic restructuring. We have worked hard to promote coordinated growth of consumption, export and investment, with a special emphasis on boosting domestic demand and increasing household consumption. We have no intention to seek trade surplus. Quite the contrary, we have always placed high importance on achieving equilibrium in the balance of international payments in an effort to maintain macroeconomic stability. Last year, China’s trade surplus dropped by US$102 billion over the previous year, yet our import in goods reached US$1.0056 trillion, making China the world’s second largest importing country and presenting great opportunities for foreign goods and services. We have been following a managed floating exchange rate regime in accordance with the principle of independent initiative, controllability and gradualism. Despite the tremendous difficulties caused by the global financial crisis, we have kept the RMB exchange rate basically stable and have thus made contribution to the stability of the international economic and financial systems.

Dear Colleagues,

The Shanghai World Expo will open in two weeks. The World Expo is a great event for countries to increase economic and cultural exchanges and promote progress of human civilization. On behalf of the Chinese government and people, I warmly welcome friends from Brazil, India, Russia and all countries of the world to go to the beautiful city of Shanghai and join us in this great event. Together, we will contribute to and witness a successful, splendid and memorable World Expo.

Thank you!",President,Hu Jintao,https://www.fmprc.gov.cn/ce/cgvienna/eng/xw/t683652.htm,,INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS
Russia,14-10-2008,Dmitry Medvedev,Opening Address at the Joint Meeting of the State Council Presidium and the Council for the Development of Physical Education and Sport,"Good day dear colleagues!

This event has turned out to be very representative. If everyone in this room is involved in sports this would already be good, and if it is part of their professional duties then it is doubly good. Because we are here to discuss measures to promote the development of physical culture and sport in our country. This joint meeting of the Presidium of the State Council of Russia and the Presidential Council for the Development of Physical Culture and Sport has been planned for a long time.

I will not speak in platitudes: of course you all understand the importance of this issue. Therefore without any superfluous words I will get right to the heart of the matter. I will start with a brief analysis of the Russian team performance at the Olympic and Paralympic Games, and make a short summary. Even though this has already been done it will be useful to start the discussion this way.

Victory in such competitions is a crucial indicator of the level of sports development in any country and in ours too. Such victories provide a clear picture of the level of development of individual sports.

At the Olympics Russia maintained its leadership position and was ranked third in the medal standings. And in general this is an important and positive result. Our team performed honourably.

Of course not all our predictions came true: we won less medals than in previous games. At the same time, our main rivals — the People's Republic of China and the United States — won more than they did in previous Olympics.

We unfortunately lost some of our achievements in team sports, and in certain ones we performed – as one says – below capacity.

As for our Paralympians, they gave their best performance ever at the Summer Games. One in two Russian athletes was a champion or a medal winner.

There is no doubt that all these results will ultimately fuel our national pride and strengthen the international authority of the Russian Federation. You know how fans share in the results and what they feel when a Russian flag is raised. These are incomparable emotions both for athletes and for millions of Russian fans. But it is clear when we think about the future that we will face very tough competition. We need to prepare very seriously even to maintain the position that we achieved at the Olympics this year.

I think that we need to analyse the pluses and minuses in the preparation of the Olympic team and have a frank conversation about the effectiveness of the entire sports sector.

Today I will touch on the urgent measures that we need to take in the foreseeable future and in the strategic period up to 2020.

I will recall that the State Council addressed the theme of sport already in 2002, when the sports industry was in critical condition. The implementation of the measures discussed by the State Council ultimately resulted in some positive changes in the sports sector and increased respect for sport among society.

A separate document – a federal law on physical culture and sport – and other normative acts were adopted. The federal target programme for 2006–2015 actually earned a total amount of funding of more than 100 billion rubles.

Since 2002 we have built nearly 24,000 sports facilities. Is this a lot or a little? The answer is obvious: it is few. Nevertheless regional programmes have been active and some of them are very good, including with respect to the physical education of children, adolescents and young adults. By the way, a whole range of Russian territories took away a great deal of medals from Beijing.

The corresponding Presidential Council was formed and has convened, a sports channel was established. Our entrepreneurs — and we should thank them for this as well – organised a fund to support Olympians and generally became more involved in the social protection of athletes; they intend to continue to do so in the future. As a result, of course the importance of sport and the opportunities for people to maintain a normal physical condition have increased, but this is still very little.

I cannot fail to mention another encouraging fact. Russia defended its applications to host the 22nd Winter Olympics in Sochi and the Summer World Student Games in Kazan with honour. Both of these achievements are important results, but we must not stop there.

The figures, which are well known, are as follows: today 15 percent of Russians are regularly involved in physical education and sport, in other words, 85 percent or more than two-thirds do not engage in any physical activity or sports. This is very low, extremely low.

And this figure reflects not so much people's indifference to sport, but also the lack of available opportunities to play sports. We all know the situation. In a given locality, small or large, a new sports centre, a sports establishment appears and life immediately revives: new sections open, parents drive their children, and a new micro-environment is created — the climate becomes more healthy.

The irony is that we have done a great deal to collect the necessary resources to develop sport but they are not used effectively. In general they are mediocre and in a number of places simply bad: the majority of sports schools have a terrible material base. Sports halls are available only in 50 percent of the cases where they should be and swimming pools do not even reach the 6 percent mark. We understand what this means; just compare these figures with the availability of swimming pools in other countries. This is merely an example. Of course the outcome of all this is not high.

In practice we have no system of sports clubs both near places of residence or employment. There are not enough affordable sports halls and open areas. And of course this is not just about fitness clubs — a lot have been organised recently — but also about cheap, full-value sports infrastructure. And this should be dealt with by local authorities in the given city, town or village; this is their direct responsibility. And of course they should do so with the support of the region and the federal centre. There is no fantasy here. In fact I am referring to support for initiatives that were made some time ago.

Today it is absolutely possible to take into account the needs of people of all ages, people with disabilities, disabled people and we must do so without delay.

The system of physical education in educational institutions requires fundamental modernisation. Again statistics show that 80 percent of our students have sedentary ways of life: they either sit in classes or they continue to sit at home in front of their computers. Unfortunately, they do not have all necessary opportunities though few attend sports facilities when they do exist. Often schools — not everywhere of course but some schools — carry out physical education lessons according to a 'tick the box' system so to speak. In other words, not how they should be.

We discussed this issue yesterday when I met with our tennis players, but this can be said about almost any school. Here we have to talk about how to generally organise physical education lessons and perhaps apply certain principles that are applied in other countries.

The cost of this 'inertia' is the deterioration of the health of two thirds of our students and is often accompanied by their physical and moral degradation as well. We are now paying attention to those who will go on to be conscripts but, unfortunately, this is also based on enthusiasm only – there is no system in place.

So far there is nothing outstanding in student sports, even though it certainly has its achievements, the activities of sport clubs are shrinking, while over a half of all universities – and unfortunately in Russia there are very many that compromised on quality – cannot even cope with the demands of academic disciplines for physical education: there simply are no such classes.

To date we are still searching for new ways to organise student sports and new arrangements for its funding. I will not speak in platitudes: you are all well aware that student sports is the basis for high sport achievements throughout the world. With such a development rate, of course we are lagging a great deal behind the demand that exists among our people and this is simply unacceptable.

Obviously we need to make significant adjustments and – as I said just a short time ago – adopt a clear and consistent strategy for the development of physical culture and sport until 2020. Its main goal is to create conditions so that at least half of our citizens and at least 80 percent of Russian children play sports. Work on such a strategy must be open — it is not a departmental, but rather a public document – and representatives of all regions, of sporting communities as well as business communities, in short all those present here, should be involved in the preparation of this document. However, before approving the strategy it is necessary to take a number of operational measures that will have a rapid impact first and foremost on children, adolescents and young people, measures to develop technologies that will make their physical education more attractive and – most importantly – more effective.

One very important issue about which we have spoken repeatedly is new sports teachers. And the most important thing in this respect is a different system of training and material incentives. We must consider this issue and take a very tough approach to the logistical requirements of equipment in physical education classes in schools, because if we do not invest here then nothing will turn out.

I would draw your attention to the creation of school teams in various sports. Just yesterday we talked about this during my meeting with Russian tennis players. I am confident that you can create these teams in other sports and hold national competitions between them. All this should be done very quickly, especially given that in 2013 our country will host the Summer World Student Games.

Dear colleagues, one of our central tasks consists in preparing for the Olympic and Paralympic Games in Sochi. You know that we want to build not only an Olympic capital but also one of the best resorts in the world and provide the city's residents and all the citizens of Russia with advanced and convenient infrastructure. In this regard, I have accepted the proposal from the government cabinet about certain changes in its structure and as soon as possible we will introduce a new Deputy Prime Minister who will oversee preparations for the Olympic and Paralympic Games in Sochi. I intend to take all necessary decisions in this regard in the near future.

At home we should not just perform in an average way. We must strive to do very well. I will not cite examples from our Chinese friends, but we must strive for similar results.

It is already necessary to review the preparation of sports teams and in doing so to provide incentives for coaches who are willing to prepare their athletes to produce the best results. We worked on this system in the board of trustees of the support fund for Olympic athletes. As chairman of that council I discussed many different programmes, but simply enthusiasm, or money received from business is not enough — this should also be a systematic project.

We must pay particular attention to the management of high-level sports. We must quickly build and reconstruct the training base of national teams, and introduce advanced sporting and medical techniques.

And finally there is one other important task, namely the creation of infrastructure for Paralympic sport. I recently met with our Paralympic team. They are keen to work and you know the efforts they are willing to expend. Therefore our Paralympians should be given more opportunities to be heard at international and Russian national competitions.

The value of sports for any society cannot be overstated, especially for a growing society and a state that is in the process of consolidation. Therefore what we are working on today is, in fact, one of the most important national priorities. Starting from here I propose to organise our discussion. ",President,Dmitry Medvedev,http://en.kremlin.ru/events/president/transcripts/statements/1729,,DEVELOPMENT
USA,07-07-2016,Barack Obama,"
Statement by the President"," Good evening, everybody.  I know we've been on a long flight, but given the extraordinary interest in the shootings that took place in Louisiana and Minnesota, I thought it would be important for me to address all of you directly. 

     And I want to begin by expressing my condolences for the families of Alton Sterling and Philando Castile. 

     As I said in the statement that I posted on Facebook, we have seen tragedies like this too many times.  The Justice Department, I know, has opened a civil rights investigation in Baton Rouge.  The governor of Minnesota, I understand, is calling for an investigation there, as well.  As is my practice, given my institutional role, I can't comment on the specific facts of these cases, and I have full confidence in the Justice Department’s ability to conduct a thorough and fair inquiry. 

     But what I can say is that all of us as Americans should be troubled by these shootings, because these are not isolated incidents.  They’re symptomatic of a broader set of racial disparities that exist in our criminal justice system.  And I just want to give people a few statistics to try to put in context why emotions are so raw around these issues. 

According to various studies -- not just one, but a wide range of studies that have been carried out over a number of years -- African Americans are 30 percent more likely than whites to be pulled over.  After being pulled over, African Americans and Hispanics are three times more likely to be searched.  Last year, African Americans were shot by police at more than twice the rate of whites.  African Americans are arrested at twice the rate of whites.  African American defendants are 75 percent more likely to be charged with offenses carrying mandatory minimums.  They receive sentences that are almost 10 percent longer than comparable whites arrested for the same crime. 

     So that if you add it all up, the African American and Hispanic population, who make up only 30 percent of the general population, make up more than half of the incarcerated population.

     Now, these are facts.  And when incidents like this occur, there’s a big chunk of our fellow citizenry that feels as if because of the color of their skin, they are not being treated the same.  And that hurts.  And that should trouble all of us.  This is not just a black issue.  It's not just a Hispanic issue. This is an American issue that we should all care about.  All fair-minded people should be concerned.

     Now, let me just say we have extraordinary appreciation and respect for the vast majority of police officers who put their lives on the line to protect us every single day.  They’ve got a dangerous job.  It is a tough job.  And as I've said before, they have a right to go home to their families, just like anybody else on the job.  And there are going to be circumstances in which they’ve got to make split-second decisions.  We understand that.

But when we see data that indicates disparities in how African Americans and Latinos may be treated in various jurisdictions around the country, then it's incumbent on all of us to say, we can do better than this; we are better than this -- and to not have it degenerate into the usual political scrum.  We should be able to step back, reflect, and ask ourselves, what can we do better so that everybody feels as if they’re equal under the law?

     Now, the good news is, is that there are practices we can institute that will make a difference.  Last year, we put together a task force that was comprised of civil rights activists and community leaders, but also law enforcement officials -- police captains, sheriffs.  And they sat around a table and they looked at the data and they looked at best practices, and they came up with specific recommendations and steps that could ensure that the trust between communities and police departments were rebuilt and incidents like this would be less likely to occur.

     And there are some jurisdictions out there that have adopted these recommendations.  But there are a whole bunch that have not.  And if anything good comes out of these tragedies, my hope is, is that communities around the country take a look and say, how can we implement these recommendations, and that the overwhelming majority of police officers who are doing a great job every single day, and are doing their job without regard to race, that they encourage their leadership and organizations that represent them to get behind these recommendations.

     Because, ultimately, if you can rebuild trust between communities and the police departments that serve them, that helps us solve crime problems.  That will make life easier for police officers.  They will have more cooperation.  They will be safer.  They will be more likely to come home.  So it would be good for crime-fighting and it will avert tragedy.

     And I'm encouraged by the fact that the majority of leadership in police departments around the country recognize this.  But change has been too slow and we have to have a greater sense of urgency about this.

     I'm also encouraged, by the way, that we have bipartisan support for criminal justice reform working its way through Congress.  It has stalled and lost some momentum over the last couple of months, in part because Congress is having difficulty, generally, moving legislation forward, and we're in a political season.  But there are people of goodwill on the Republican side and the Democratic side who I've seen want to try to get something done here.  That, too, would help provide greater assurance across the country that those in power, those in authority are taking these issues seriously.  So this should be a spur to action to get that done, to get that across the finish line.  Because I know there are a lot of people who want to get it done.

     Let me just make a couple of final comments.  I mentioned in my Facebook statement that I hope we don't fall into the typical patterns that occur after these kinds of incidents occur, where right away there’s a lot of political rhetoric and it starts dividing people instead of bringing folks together.  To be concerned about these issues is not to be against law enforcement.  There are times when these incidents occur, and you see protests and you see vigils.  And I get letters -- well-meaning letters sometimes -- from law enforcement saying, how come we’re under attack?  How come not as much emphasis is made when police officers are shot? 

And so, to all of law enforcement, I want to be very clear: We know you have a tough job.  We mourn those in uniform who are protecting us who lose their lives.  On a regular basis, I have joined with families in front of Capitol Hill to commemorate the incredible heroism that they’ve displayed.  I’ve hugged family members who’ve lost loved ones doing the right thing.  I know how much it hurts.  On a regular basis, we bring in those who’ve done heroic work in law enforcement, and have survived.  Sometimes they’ve been injured. Sometimes they’ve risked their lives in remarkable ways.  And we applaud them and appreciate them, because they’re doing a really tough job really well.

There is no contradiction between us supporting law enforcement -- making sure they’ve got the equipment they need, making sure that their collective bargaining rights are recognized, making sure that they’re adequately staffed, making sure that they are respected, making sure their families are supported -- and also saying that there are problems across our criminal justice system, there are biases -- some conscious and unconscious -- that have to be rooted out.  That’s not an attack on law enforcement.  That is reflective of the values that the vast majority of law enforcement bring to the job. 

But I repeat:  If communities are mistrustful of the police, that makes those law enforcement officers who are doing a great job and are doing the right thing, it makes their lives harder.  So when people say “Black Lives Matter,” that doesn’t mean blue lives don’t matter; it just means all lives matter, but right now the big concern is the fact that the data shows black folks are more vulnerable to these kinds of incidents. 

This isn’t a matter of us comparing the value of lives.  This is recognizing that there is a particular burden that is being placed on a group of our fellow citizens.  And we should care about that.  We can’t dismiss it.  We can’t dismiss it.

So let me just end by saying I actually, genuinely, truly believe that the vast majority of American people see this as a problem that we should all care about.  And I would just ask those who question the sincerity or the legitimacy of protests and vigils and expressions of outrage, who somehow label those expressions of outrage as “political correctness,” I’d just ask folks to step back and think, what if this happened to somebody in your family?  How would you feel? 

To be concerned about these issues is not political correctness.  It’s just being an American, and wanting to live up to our best and highest ideals.  And it’s to recognize the reality that we’ve got some tough history and we haven’t gotten through all of that history yet.  And we don’t expect that in my lifetime, maybe not in my children’s lifetime, that all the vestiges of that past will have been cured, will have been solved, but we can do better.  People of goodwill can do better.

And doing better involves not just addressing potential bias in the criminal justice system.  It’s recognizing that too often we’re asking police to man the barricades in communities that have been forgotten by all of us for way too long, in terms of substandard schools, and inadequate jobs, and a lack of opportunity. 

We’ve got to tackle those things.  We can do better.  And I believe we will do better. 

Thanks very much, everybody.",President,Barack Obama,https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/the-press-office/2016/07/07/statement-president,,OTHERS
Russia,22-11-2000,Vladimir Putin,Opening Remarks at a State Council Meeting," Good afternoon, colleagues!

First of all, I want to congratulate you on the beginning of the State Council’s work. It is doubtless an important event in the country’s political life.

The past six months were a difficult but also a dynamic period for us. Together we have achieved a good deal, made advances on federative relations, and revised the principles on which the Federation Council is based. Your proposals and what only recently was just a general idea have been fleshed out into a new mechanism. New for us, but well-known from past experience. As a political body the State Council is, in my opinion, an absolute necessity and of utmost importance both for the centre and regions of the Federation.

To set up the State Council and make it work required our understanding of the need for such a step. It required a common political will. Of course, we did not arrive at the decision at once. We openly, frankly and in detail discussed the role of this fundamentally new body in Russia’s political setup.

Today’s agenda has been drawn up by the State Council’s Presidium, which, as you know, will have a rotating membership. Practically all the proposed items are important and interesting. But the question today that is most often raised and best prepared is that of a strategy for the country’s social and economic development, with an emphasis on the regional aspect. I sincerely hope that our discussion will be interesting, informative and useful.

Before I go over to the agenda, allow me to make a few remarks.

Here, in the State Council, our task is to formulate a consolidated position on key aspects of the country’s development. Of course, we cannot and must not skip current issues. That would be impossible. But it appears to me that the State Council should act, above all, as a political-strategy think tank. This is what sets it apart from other administrative and advisory bodies. The State Council can set the course for the country to follow but must not double as a Parliament or Government. We have our work cut out for us: we need to adopt the required approaches and learn to work in this manner, learn to look at problems through the prism of national interest. It may sometimes do good to pause and forget for a moment routine matters and petty administrative details. The same goes for purely regional or purely federal problems. There are bigger things to tackle if the country is to forge ahead and do it effectively.

To be sure, strategic policy is the responsibility of the federal administration. The Government, too, is doing a lot in this respect. But here, within the State Council, we will be able not only to coordinate our positions but also obtain a more detailed picture of the regional landscape, and mesh the Federation’s interests with those of individual regions.

Surely you have your own experience and your own approaches to political matters and to shaping economic programmes for your regions. It must be frankly said that regional leaders are more attuned to the needs and requirements of the local population, they bear the burden of responsibility imposed on them by their voters, and know how Moscow decisions translate for the rank-and-file. But in order to put flesh on the bones of seminal ideas, we must view strategies as nationwide directives. Our common goal is to guarantee the legal, economic and political unity of the country with due consideration for local specifics.

A major segment of our work involves strengthening the vertical power structures, something we have discussed many times and something that has been debated so actively and heatedly in society. It implies both control from the federal centre and effective feedback. I am sure the State Council can be an excellent tool for such an interdependent relationship.

And one more remark. Under the Constitution, the executive branch at the centre and in the provinces is one whole. We have many jointly administered facilities. The President of Tatarstan will speak about that today. He is head of one of the groups we established in the Presidium. Nor can we forget the provisions of Article 77 of Russia’s Constitution, which highlights the unity of the Russian Federation’s executive branch. We believe it is important not only to make decisions, but also to implement them. We were guided by this consideration when we ultimately decided on this make-up of the State Council.

Our State Council has roots that go far back in history. In Russia, it was power-wielding bodies that almost always made major strategic decisions. No one, of course, can offer ready-made solutions or generally accepted recipes for successful work. It is a painstaking effort, complex and responsible.

Prime Minister Mikhail Kasyanov and Khabarovsk Regional Governor Vladimir Ishayev are going to give their reports today. But one report or one meeting is not, of course, enough to produce a strategy for national development. That consists of programmes and documents drawn up by the Government, the Federal Assembly, local bodies of authority, and actions by Presidential Envoys to the Federal Districts.

Lastly, I would like to call your attention to the fact that a strategy does not boil down to economic matters alone, like those to be dealt with in today’s reports. We need strategies in the social, educational and scientific fields, in health services, and on national security. And for international relations, of course. We must know the place Russia occupies in the world. Special groups and commissions will discuss these aspects of our work. Please find the necessary time and do not delegate your powers and functions to your assistants and experts, who have enough difficult and important duties as it is. We must take political responsibility for decision-making.

I thank you for your time and attention and suggest we begin work.",President,Vladimir Putin,http://en.kremlin.ru/events/president/transcripts/statements/21122,,DEVELOPMENT
United Kingdom,04-Jun-20,Boris Johnson,PM Global Vaccine Summit closing remarks: 4 June 2020,"As we bring this summit to a conclusion, let me thank you all for the generosity of your contributions today. Together, we have replenished this alliance, securing – and I’m the lucky one that gets to make the big announcement – a fantastic $8.8bn for Gavi’s vital work over the next five years. And I want to say a particular thank you to Bill and Melinda Gates for their generosity, their philanthropy, yet again, and their continued leadership in humanity’s battle against disease. Our ancestors had to live with the unavoidable reality that killer pathogens could at any time strike down their children, imposing an incalculable burden of sorrow. Yet, today, thanks to the ingenuity of Edward Jenner, a British doctor from Gloucestershire who pioneered the world’s first vaccine, the simple act of inoculating our children can save lives many times over. Vaccines work. People who are vaccinated protect themselves and the rest of the population by lowering the spread and risk of infection. Gavi’s work on routine immunisation is the strongest shield against outbreaks of infectious diseases, and so it is that our collective efforts at this Summit will now save up to 8 million lives. Our actions – your actions - will also support healthcare systems in the world’s poorest countries, which are increasingly victims of coronavirus. So today, as we make the choice to unite and forge a path of global co-operation, let us also renew our collective resolve to find the vaccine that can in the end defeat coronavirus. For our part, the UK has already committed up to £764 million for the global coronavirus response. And I’m proud to say that some of the most promising research into vaccines is happening here, supported by our Vaccine Taskforce. We are pioneering the innovative collaborations that will be needed to manufacture and distribute a vaccine, once found, like the partnership between AstraZeneca and the University of Oxford. So as we conclude today, let us unite to stop a disease like coronavirus causing such devastation ever again. Just as we have great military alliances like NATO – and I hope that those of you not in NATO know what I mean - where countries collaborate on building their collective military defence, so we now need that same spirit of collaboration and collective defence against the common enemy of disease. It will require a new international effort to co-operate on the surveillance and sharing of information that can underpin a global alert system so we can rapidly identify any future outbreak. And it will need a radical scaling up of our global capacity to respond, exactly as Bill [Gates] has set out. So just as Britain has been honoured to host this summit today, you can count on our full contribution as together we rise to fulfil the greatest shared endeavour of our lifetimes: the triumph of humanity over disease, now and for the generations that follow. Thank you.",Prime Minister,Boris Johnson,https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/pm-global-vaccine-summit-closing-remarks-4-june-2020,,INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS
Russia,11-05-2010 00:00,Dmitry Medvedev,Farewell to Viktor Chernomyrdin,"Relatives of Viktor Chernomyrdin, ladies and gentlemen, colleagues, friends,

Today, we pay our last respect to Viktor Chernomyrdin, our comrade, who dedicated his entire life to serving his country. His biography was that of a hard working person, hence extraordinary, as during his career he practically dealt with all sorts of things and held various positions always acting with honour and success. It is absolutely evident that his most challenging experience was serving as Prime Minister during a very difficult time of the 1990s.

The nature of time is that people quickly forget the subject matter of events, retaining only the most striking reminiscences. The 1990s were exceptionally perplexed indeed as the country was in an extremely grave situation, many people lost their jobs and incomes, and the public mood was rather gloomy. That was the burden taken up by Mr Chernomyrdin as the Prime Minister of the Russian Federation. In terms of law, he was the first Prime Minister of the country appointed after the new Constitution was enacted. For years, he worked tirelessly in this position and it was certainly the most difficult period in his biography when he did absolutely everything to maintain peace in the society and to resolve urgent economic problems.

I remember very well the significance of his appointment as Prime Minister, as it obviously helped cool down political ardours and produced a politician capable to consolidate and assure people which then was so much needed.

I did not work with Mr Chernomyrdin in the 1990s and only met him in 2000 when I succeeded him as chairman of the board of directors of Gazprom. A significant portion of Mr Chernomyrdin’s career was in the gas sector and he was in fact one of those who created the industry in Russia and in practical terms designed it to become a major component of the national economy. It is thanks to his efforts that electricity and heating are available at every home.

Most recently, Mr Chernomyrdin held another very difficult position, that of the ambassador of Russia to Ukraine, and over the complicated period of time he skilfully levelled out the collisions between the two states, settled the conflicts which flamed between politicians, and simply contributed to restoring normal ties between the two fraternal nations. The sound Russian-Ukrainian relations we have today are to a great extent the result of the efforts of Mr Chernomyrdin who loved both Ukraine and his motherland and who did everything to promote friendly and sincere relations between our countries.

There is one other thing that I cannot fail to mention: Mr Chernomyrdin was an optimist. We communicated a lot, but I cannot remember ever seeing him in a bad mood or him demonstrating his bad moods. Instead, he was always smiling, always joking, and his jokes had a peculiar flair and elegance.

In every position where I met with him, he was always geared toward working efficiently, and he never shied away from taking on any additional burdens, even when he was Prime Minister of the Russian Federation.

All of these witness the fact that Mr Chernomyrdin was an exceptionally wise and experienced person who selflessly loved his motherland, who genuinely loved his native village where he and I once met, as well as our entire country.

Viktor Chernomyrdin is, without a doubt, an outstanding contemporary Russian politician, one of the brightest and mightiest statesmen of the last twenty years.

Viktor Chernomyrdin will remain forever in our memories.

Lest we forget.",President,Dmitry Medvedev,http://en.kremlin.ru/events/president/transcripts/statements/9429,,OTHERS
Russia,14-08-2008,Dmitry Medvedev,Meeting with Servicemen from the Russian Armed Forces,"Dear comrade officers!

First of all I would like to thank you for your honourable performance of military duty during the peacekeeping mission. The work was carried out effectively and was in the interests of the people of the Russian Federation. The targets set during the operation were fully achieved. Soldiers who were directly involved in the peacekeeping operations and who are well aware of the magnitude of the tragedy that occurred in South Ossetia are here today.

Let us call things what they are: the people of South Ossetia have survived a genocide and we need to say it. To heal these wounds will take years, maybe decades. And the actions we took to halt the extermination of almost an entire people were legitimate, inevitable and absolutely justified, not to mention the fact that the protection of its people, of its citizens, is the direct duty of the Russian state. And peacekeeping forces performed accurately in full accordance with the tasks they were given.

There are casualties among the Russian peacekeepers caught in the heat of aggression. Yesterday was a day of mourning in Russia, and I ask once again that you convey our deepest condolences to the relatives and friends of the victims. I would like you to know at once that we will provide them with all necessary support. The families of the soldiers who sacrificed their lives for their homeland should receive the utmost attention from the state. I am instructing the Minister of Defence to prepare a full list to take the necessary decisions concerning their welfare.

On 12 August 2008 we announced the end of operations forcing the Georgian authorities to restore peace. That same day we adopted Statement on the Principles of Conflict Resolution, that is a basis for the agreement which we still have to sign and principles which were just agreed to by the South Ossetian and Abkhazian parties. Russia, the EU and the OSCE will guarantee this agreement. I would like to specially underline to you, as defenders of your country, that no declaration will be able to replace this binding document, and we will insist on this. The Georgian side has been evasive about this for many years and it must be done now, after the massacre which occurred. Our current goal remains a definitive ceasefire by Georgia and the withdrawal of their troops to their permanent positions, which is also provided for in the principles.

As you know perfectly well, the situation in South Ossetia remains very difficult. In this regard, we are obliged to keep our peacekeepers in a state of constant preparedness. This is an obvious way of deterring the Georgian side and, in addition, a way of dealing with the critical conditions of the humanitarian disaster and its consequences that we now face.

Everyone who works in the region, irrespective of their nationality or which state they belong to, now needs security they can rely on. At the same time, we will naturally use the entire arsenal of diplomatic means necessary for further settlement. And, of course, the state will do its utmost to strengthen the army and navy, to modernise the Armed Forces and to ensure social guarantees for military personnel.

Once again I thank you and your comrades for your courage. A few minutes ago I signed the first decree on state awards. Naturally I will meet with those who are not here in this room, those who in the frontlines defended the ideals of peacekeeping and the interests of Russia. You have participated in a noble operation, saving defenceless people who were treacherously attacked. I am confident that you will continue to protect the lives and interests of Russian citizens, and to carry out your civilian, military and human duties.",President,Dmitry Medvedev,http://en.kremlin.ru/events/president/transcripts/statements/1093,,INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS
USA,20-02-2018 00:00,Donald Trump,Remarks by President Trump at Medal of Valor Ceremony,"THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you, thank you very much.  And thank you — please — and thank you to Attorney General Sessions, and to Secretary Mnuchin, Director Pompeo, Congressman Issa for joining us for this very special ceremony.

To a very, very incredible group of heroes who we’re celebrating today, welcome all to the White House.  Incredible job.  Thank you.

To the families who are here with you, each of you also serves and sacrifices for your country, and so I want to thank all of the families, the great families, because you’re being honored, also.  Thank you very much.  Thank you.  Great job.  (Applause.)  Right?

We’re also so pleased — and I will tell you — to be gathered here today to recognize 12 really extraordinary law enforcement officers and first responders, and to award them the Medal of Valor.  And that’s a big deal.

As we come together to recognize these brave Americans, I know all of us here today, and across the entire nation, are grieving for the community of Parkland in the great state of Florida.  We’re working very hard to make sense of these events.

On Saturday, I met with some of the survivors and their families, and I was moved — greatly moved, greatly moved — by their strength, their resilience; and heartbroken for the families whose loved ones were so cruelly torn from them forever.  Forever and ever.

We cannot imagine the depths of their anguish, but we can pledge the strength of our resolve.  And we must do more to protect our children.  We have to do more to protect our children.

This week, I will be holding a number of discussions with students, local leaders, and law enforcement to develop concrete steps that we can take to secure our schools, safeguard our students, and protect our communities.

School safety is a top priority for my administration.  That is why, when governors from across the nation visit the White House next week, we will be discussing, at great length, what the federal and state governments can do to keep our students safe.

This includes implementing commonsense security measures and addressing mental health issues, including better coordination between federal and state law enforcement to take swift action when there are warning signs.

In addition, after the deadly shooting in Las Vegas, I directed the Attorney General to clarify whether certain bump stock devices, like the one used in Las Vegas, are illegal under current law.  That process began in December.

I just — a few moments ago — I signed a memorandum directing the Attorney General to propose regulations to ban all devices that turn legal weapons into machine guns.  I expect that these critical regulations will be finalized, Jeff, very soon.

The key in all of these efforts, as I said in my remarks the day after the shooting, is that we cannot merely take actions that make us feel like we are making a difference.  We must actually make a difference.

We must move past clichés and tired debates and focus on evidence-based solutions and security measures that actually work, and that make it easier for men and women of law enforcement to protect our children and to protect our safety.

In the aftermath of this evil massacre, our spirits have been lifted by the accounts of bravery at the Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School — coaches, teachers, students, law enforcement officers, and others — who have shown us that the forces of love and courage are always stronger than the forces of evil and hate.

It’s this truth that brings us together today.

The 12 patriots we honor come from many places, and serve in many different roles, but they all share one thing in common: When faced with danger, they each put the lives of others before their own.  These are very brave people that I’m standing with today.

Here with us are Lieutenant William Buchanan and Emergency Medical Technician Sean Ochsenbein.  Where are you two guys?  Yeah, that’s what I thought.  (Laughter.)  Good looking guys.  That’s good.

They were both off duty near Elizabethton, in the great state of Tennessee — and it is a great state — when they saw a smoldering car with a passenger trapped inside.

They braved smoke, fire, and the danger of explosion to rescue the man.  And they saved his life.  People thought it would be impossible to save his life.  William, Sean, thank you both very much.  Great job.  Great bravery.  (Applause.)

Fire Engineer Stephen Gunn is also here.  He was first on the scene of a dangerous fire started by an arsonist in Phoenix, Arizona.  As flames engulfed the home, Engineer Gunn charged inside to save an unconscious man.

Within seconds, Stephen’s helmet began to melt and his skin began to burn — not good — but he carried the man out before the house collapsed.  And that’s by seconds.

Engineer Gunn, I understand you keep your melted helmet as a reminder of that day.  Now, you will have a symbol of our nation’s gratitude to go alongside of that very charred helmet.  Something much prettier than that helmet.  Beautiful medal.  Thank you very much.  Great job.  Thank you.  Thank you.  (Applause.)

On a February evening in California, Harbor Patrol Officer David Poirier, Jr., of Redondo Beach Fire Department was aboard a patrol boat with the captain when they received a call that people were drowning in the ocean.  Four people who had been fishing along the sea wall were swept into the ocean by raging waves.  This was a rough day.

Officer Poirier jumped into the dark, icy water and helped get the three survivors on top of a rock, while the captain went back for more help.  And that on top of the rock was a rough stay for all of them.

Each time waves crashed over the rock, they were all tossed back into the water.  But again and again, Officer Poirier rescued them until more help arrived, and saved the lives of those three people.

Officer Poirier, a job well done.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  (Applause.)

When a gunman began firing at the employees of Excel Industries in Hesston, Kansas, Chief Douglas Schroeder charged into the building without any backup whatsoever.  He closed in on the shooter, dodging bullets and firing back, until he stopped the killer cold.

Chief Schroeder, you saved a lot of lives.  Thank God you were there.  Thank you, Chief.  Thank you.  (Applause.)

Officer Andrew Hopfensperger, Jr. — that’s a very important “Jr.,” isn’t it?  Huh?  I know you’re very proud of your father — was patrolling the parking lot of Antigo High School in Wisconsin, during the school’s junior prom, when he heard a burst of gunfire.  Within 19 seconds, he found the shooter, and took him down just before he was about to kill 4 innocent students.

Andrew, incredible job.  Thank you very much.  Thank you.  Thank you.  (Applause.)

Finally, when terrorists attacked defenseless employees of the San Bernardino Department of Public Health, six of the heroes with us today chased them down and put an end to their sinister rampage, which was going to get a lot worse.

During the attack, Officer Nicholas Koahou was shot in the leg.  But he continued to fight back, despite a really horrific wound.

Today, we are fortunate to honor him and the rest of that amazing team — Corporal Rafael Ixco, Detective Bruce Southworth, Deputy Shaun Wallen, Detective Brian Olvera, and Investigator Chad Johnson.  Thank you all very much.  That’s great.  Great.  (Applause.)

Some fantastic stories, and we thank you.  To each of the 12 heroes who are about to receive the Medal of Valor, you have earned an eternal place in the gratitude, in our history, and in our hearts.  Through your service and sacrifice, we are reminded that America’s greatest treasure is her people.  In your courage, we see America’s strength.  And in your character, we see America’s soul.

And today, one proud nation says to all of you: Thank you, God bless you, and God forever bless these great heroes.  (Applause.)  Fantastic.  Thank you, fellas.  Nice work, gentlemen.  Thank you so much.

Now I’d like to ask the military aide to come forward and read the citations.

MILITARY AIDE:  Medal of Valor, presented to Lieutenant William Buchanan of the Avery County, North Carolina Sheriff’s Office and Emergency Medical Technician Sean Ochsenbein of the Putnam County, Tennessee Rescue Squad.

For thinking quickly and acting courageously to rescue a man from a burning vehicle following a violent two-car collision.  The two officers had never met and were off duty at the time of the accident, but their coordinated and selfless actions ensured the safety of the driver.

(The Medal of Valor is presented.)  (Applause.)

Engineer Stephen Gunn.

Medal of Valor, presented to Engineer Stephen Gunn of the Peoria, Arizona Fire-Medical Department

For stepping through smoke and flames to rescue an unconscious man from a house set on fire by an arsonist.  As the intense heat melted his helmet and burned his skin, Engineer Gunn managed to remove the victim from a room engulfed in flames.

(The Medal of Valor is presented.)  (Applause.)

Firefighter/Harbor Patrol Officer, David Poirier, Jr.

Medal of Valor presented to Firefighter/Harbor Patrol Officer David Poirier Junior of the Redondo Beach, California Fire Department.

Medal of Valor presented to Officer Nicholas Koahou of the Redlands, California Police Department; Corporal Rafael Ixco, Detective Bruce Southworth, and Deputy Shaun Wallen of the San Bernardino County, California Sheriff’s Office; Detective Brian Olvera of the San Bernardino, California Police Department; and District Attorney Investigator Chad Johnson of the San Bernardino, California County District Attorney’s Office.

For bravely pursuing two heavily armed assailants who had killed 14 people in an attack on a San Bernardino, California workplace.  The officers sustained fire from assault weapons before mortally wounding both terrorists.

(Medals of Valor are presented.)  (Applause.)

THE PRESIDENT:  Very brave people.  I want to thank you in particular.  And enjoy the rest of your day, folks.  We’re doing some incredible things in our country and you’re starting to see.

And we will be working very, very hard on that horrible, horrible issue that took place last week in Florida.  We’re working very hard.  We’re going to come up with solutions.  It’s been many, many years and there have been no solutions.  We’re going to come up with solutions.

Thank you all very much.  Appreciate it.  Thank you.  (Applause.)",President,Donald Trump,https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefings-statements/remarks-president-trump-medal-valor-ceremony/,,NATIONALISM
United Kingdom,20-Sep-16,Theresa May,Theresa May's speech to the UN General Assembly,"Introduction Mr President, Deputy Secretary-General, Excellencies, ladies and gentlemen, it is a great honour for me to address this General Assembly for the first time and to do so as Prime Minister of a country that has always been a proud and pro-active member at the very heart of this United Nations. This United Nations was formed because leaders across the world knew that they could only deliver security for their citizens at home if they could cooperate, as a community of nations, to deliver security across the globe. Some of the threats that we face together today are familiar to those founding leaders: war, political instability, abuses of human rights and poverty. Others are new: global terrorism, climate change, and unprecedented mass movements of people. We gather here today because we know that such challenges do not respect the borders of our individual nations and that only by working together shall we overcome them. As a new Prime Minister to the United Kingdom my pledge to this United Nations is simple: the UK will be a confident, strong and dependable partner internationally – true to the universal values that we share together. We will continue to honour our commitment to spend 0.7% of our Gross National Income on development, building on the achievements we have already made to reduce poverty, deal with instability and increase prosperity the world over. And we will drive forward the implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals. We will continue to champion the rights of women and girls, making sure that all girls get the education they deserve, and tackling horrific abuses such as female genital mutilation and the use of sexual violence in conflict. We will continue to be a steadfast, permanent member of the Security Council, meeting our NATO commitment to spend 2% of GDP on defence and making a leading contribution to UN peacekeeping efforts, where we have doubled our commitment, including new deployments to Somalia and South Sudan. We will continue to stand up for the rules based international system and for international law, and I join other leaders in condemning the outrageous bombing of the aid convoy in Syria yesterday. We will continue to play our part in the international effort against climate change. And in a demonstration of our commitment to the agreement reached in Paris, the UK will start its domestic procedures to enable ratification of the Paris agreement, and complete these before the end of the year. And we will continue to strengthen our existing partnerships, from this United Nations, to the Commonwealth and NATO, seeking to resolve conflict in countries across the world - from Colombia and Cyprus to Somalia and Yemen. Relevant and responsive institutions But we must never forget that we stand here, at this United Nations, as servants of the men and women that we represent back at home. And as we do so, we must recognise that for too many of these men and women the increasing pace of globalisation has left them feeling left behind. The challenge for those of us in this room is to ensure that our governments and our global institutions, such as this United Nations, remain responsive to the people that we serve. That we are capable of adapting our institutions to the demands of the 21st Century and ensuring that they do not become irrelevant. So when it comes to the big security and human rights challenges of our time, we need this – our United Nations - to forge a bold new multilateralism. Because as we have seen even in the past week, no country is untouched by the threat of global terrorism. And when extremists anywhere in the world can transmit their poisonous ideologies directly into the bedrooms of people vulnerable to radicalisation, we need not just to work together to prevent conflict and instability in nation states but to act globally to disrupt the networks terrorist groups use to finance their operations and recruit to their ranks. When we see the mass displacement of people, at a scale unprecedented in recent history, we must ensure we are implementing the policies that are fit for the challenges we face today. And when criminal gangs do not respect our national borders, trafficking our fellow citizens into lives of slavery and servitude, we cannot let those borders act as a barrier to bringing such criminals to justice. In each of these areas, it is the convening power of our United Nations that gives us a unique opportunity to respond. But we can only do so if we modernise and adapt to meet the challenges of the 21st Century. Terrorism As a United Nations we have shown how we can work together to reduce the threat from international terrorism by preventing conflict and instability from developing. For example, through our Permanent Membership of the Security Council, Britain has played a leading role in the fight against Al Shabaab in Somalia. Since 2010, with huge support from across the region, and critically the commitment of Somalis themselves, Al Shabaab has been driven from all the major cities it used to control. It is vital that as an international community we continue to support countries in the region that are contributing thousands of troops, and that we continue to build the capacity of Somali security forces. That is why the UK is now going to increase further our security support and we will be calling on others to do the same, hosting an international conference on Somalia in 2017 to maintain this vital momentum. Missions like this must remain central to the work of this United Nations, but on their own they are not enough. Because the terrorist threats we face today do not come from one country but exist in a different space. The global networks they exploit require a different kind of global response. These organisations are using our own modern banking networks against us. So we need to look at our regulations, our information sharing and using our technological capabilities to get ahead of them. They are targeting our airlines, exploiting the fact that no one country can keep its citizens safe when they are flying between multiple jurisdictions. That is why this week the United Nations will vote on a UK led resolution on aviation security to ensure that every country implements the standards we need to ensure that no country is the weak link. They are exploiting the internet and social media to spread an ideology that is recruiting people to their cause all over the world. So we need to tackle this ideology head-on. That is why the UK has championed the work that the Secretary General has led to develop a strategy for preventing violent extremism. Now, as an international community, we must work together to adopt and implement the most comprehensive national action plans to tackle both the causes and the symptoms of all extremism. It is not enough merely to focus on violent extremism. We need to address the whole spectrum of extremism, violent extremism and non-violent extremism; Islamist and neo-Nazi – hate and fear in all their forms. A new approach to migration Just as we need the United Nations to modernise to meet the challenges of terrorism in the 21st Century, so we also need to adapt if we are to fashion a truly global response to the mass movements of people across the world and the implications this brings for security and human rights. The 1951 convention and the 1967 protocol must remain the bedrock of our response, but the context in which they must be applied has dramatically changed. Across the world today, there are 65 million people who have been forcibly displaced. That it is equivalent to the entire population of the United Kingdom. It is an unprecedented figure, one that has almost doubled in a decade. And yet UN appeals are underfunded; host countries are not getting enough support; and refugees are not getting the aid, education and economic opportunities they need. We must do more. And as the second largest bi-lateral provider of assistance, the UK remains fully committed to playing a leading role. In the last 5 years the UK has invested over $9 billion in humanitarian assistance, saving millions of lives every year. The London Syria Conference in February raised $12 billion in pledges, the largest amount ever raised in one day in response to a humanitarian crisis. And that money is being used to combine both urgent humanitarian assistance and vital economic development, benefitting both refugees and the communities and countries hosting them. Clearly we need to continue our efforts to bring an end to the conflict and the appalling slaughter in Syria and to get aid through to those who need it. And while these efforts continue inside Syria, we also agreed new efforts to support refugees and host communities in neighbouring countries, including through education and opportunities to work. This is being assisted by loans from international financial institutions and access to European markets. And through our trading relationships and direct engagement with businesses we are mobilising the private sector to create new jobs in the region for everyone. And while there is more to be done, it is this approach to financing both humanitarian support and economic development that I will be championing when I announce a further UK financial contribution at President Obama’s Refugee Summit later today. But in addition to refugees and displaced people fleeing conflict and persecution, we are also seeing an unprecedented movement of people in search of greater economic opportunities through the same unmanaged channels. This affects all of us, and it is the responsibility of us all to take action. We cannot ignore this challenge, or allow it to continue unmanaged. We need to do better. Better for the countries people leave, for the countries they move through, for the countries they try to get to – and most of all, better for the migrants and refugees themselves. Despite the huge increase in international efforts, more migrants have died attempting hazardous journeys across borders this year than any other. I believe we have to use the opportunity afforded by this General Assembly for an honest global debate to address this global challenge. In doing so, we should be clear that there is nothing wrong with the desire to migrate for a better life. And also that controlled, legal, safe, economic migration brings benefits to our economies. But countries have to be able to exercise control over their borders. The failure to do so erodes public confidence, fuels international crime, damages economies and reduces the resources for those who genuinely need protection and whose rights under the Refugee Convention should always be fulfilled. I believe there are three fundamental principles that we now need to establish at the heart of a new approach to managing migration that is in the interests of all those involved. First, we must help ensure that refugees claim asylum in the first safe country they reach. The current trend of onward movements, where refugees reach a safe country but then press on with their journey, can only benefit criminal gangs and expose refugees to grave danger. So we must all do more to support countries where the refugees first arrive, to provide the necessary protection and assistance for refugees safely and swiftly, and to help countries adapt to the huge economic impact that refugees can have – including on their existing population. As we are seeing in Jordan, Lebanon and Turkey, when the right assistance is provided, solutions that provide sanctuary and opportunity to refugees, and opportunities for those hosting them, can be found. This is also good for the refugees and the countries they come from - because the closer they stay to home, the easier it will be for them to return and rebuild after the conflict. Second, we need to improve the ways we distinguish between refugees fleeing persecution and economic migrants. I believe we must ensure the existing convention and protocol are properly applied to provide protection to refugees and reduce the incentives for economic migrants to use illegal routes. This in turn will help us target support for those refugees who need it most and retain the support of our populations for doing so. Third, we need a better overall approach to managing economic migration which recognises that all countries have the right to control their borders - and that we must all commit to accepting the return of our own nationals when they have no right to remain elsewhere. By ensuring a managed and controlled international migration response - and at the same time investing to tackle the underlying drivers of displacement and migration at source - we can reject isolationism and xenophobia, achieving better outcomes for all of our citizens – and particularly for the most vulnerable. Modern Slavery Finally, as we gather here today to bring the founding values of the United Nations to bear on some of the most pressing global problems, the likes of which we haven’t seen before, so we must also face up to the fact that some of the worst human rights abuses that we thought we had confined to the history books have re-emerged in new pernicious forms. The Universal Declaration of Human Rights proclaimed by the General Assembly stated that all human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights, that no one shall be held in slavery or servitude and that slavery and the slave trade shall be prohibited in all their forms. Yet nearly 70 years on, we are presented with a new form of slavery: modern slavery. Organised crime groups, who are largely behind this modern slavery, lure, dupe and force innocent men, women and children into extreme forms of exploitation. Trafficked and sold across borders; victims are forced into living the kind of inhumane existence that is almost too much for our imagination. These criminals have global networks to help them make money out of some of the world’s most vulnerable people. Victims are held captive in squalid conditions under the constant shadow of violence and forced into sex and labour exploitation. If we are going to succeed in stamping out this abhorrent crime and bring the perpetrators to justice, we need to confront the reality of what we are dealing with. These organised crime groups work across borders and jurisdictions. And they often use the internet and modern technology to recruit, transport, control and exploit their victims, all the while staying ahead of legal systems that are often constrained by traditional geographical boundaries. So we must take action. We must use our international law enforcement networks to track these criminals down, wherever they are in the world, and put them behind bars where they belong. We need to be smarter and even more co-ordinated than the criminal gangs in our efforts to stop them. In the UK, I am setting up the first ever government taskforce for modern slavery, bringing together every relevant department to co-ordinate and drive all our efforts in the battle against this cruel exploitation. We are also using our aid budget to create a dedicated fund focused on high risk countries where we know victims are regularly trafficked to the UK. And yesterday, I committed the first £5 million from this fund to work in Nigeria to reduce the vulnerability of potential victims and step up the fight against those who seek to profit from this crime. But if we are to meet the Sustainable Development Goal to eradicate modern slavery, we need to go much further. Security relationships have developed between so many countries for dealing with issues like counter-terrorism, cyber security, drug trafficking and wider intelligence sharing. But we do not have a similar relationship for this fight against modern slavery. So we need our law enforcement agencies to work together, with joint investigation teams working across multiple countries. Victims will only find freedom if we cultivate a radically new, global and co-ordinated approach to defeat this vile crime. Together we must work tirelessly to preserve the freedoms and values that have defined our United Nations from its inception. Together we must work tirelessly to restore these freedoms and values to the lives of the men, women and children who are exploited for profit and held captive with little or no chance of escape. Conclusion From the St James’ Palace declaration and the Atlantic Charter forged by Winston Churchill and President Roosevelt, to the first meeting of this General Assembly in London in 1946, the United Kingdom has always been an outward-facing, global partner at the heart of international efforts to secure peace and prosperity for all our people. And that is how we will remain. For when the British people voted to leave the EU, they did not vote to turn inwards or walk away from any of our partners in the world. Faced with challenges like migration, a desire for greater control of their country, and a mounting sense that globalisation is leaving working people behind, they demanded a politics that is more in touch with their concerns; and bold action to address them. But that action must be more global, not less. Because the biggest threats to our prosperity and security do not recognise or respect international borders. And if we only focus on what we do at home, the job is barely half done. So this is not the time to turn away from our United Nations. It is the time to turn towards it. Only we, as members of this community of nations, can act to ensure this great institution becomes as relevant for our future as it has been in our past. So let us come together, true to our founding values but responsive to the challenges of today and let us work together to build a safer, more prosperous and more humane world for generations to come.",Prime Minister,Theresa May,https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/theresa-mays-speech-to-the-un-general-assembly,,DEVELOPMENT
Russia,02-07-2011 00:00,Dmitry Medvedev,Speech at meeting on the Interior Ministry’s main areas of work,"Colleagues,

Let me start with the main news. I want to inform you that I signed Federal Law On the Police Force today, and it will take effect since March 1, 2011. The long and hard work on drafting this law and the broad discussions that involved both the public and the professionals are over now, and the law is entering into force. This is a long-awaited event. I congratulate you all on this news, and I hope that you will measure up to the demands the new law sets.

As you know, the law defines the status, rights, and duties of the police force. It relieves the police force, at least partially, I hope, of duties that duplicate other agencies’ responsibilities, and of tasks it should not really be doing. It also reinforces the partnership model of relations between the police and our society. This law was drafted on my initiative as part of the transformations taking place within the Interior Ministry, and was passed after being put through discussion.

The Law On the Police Force is just the first step in the Interior Ministry’s reorganisation, as is clear to everyone here. Laws are very important of course, and the operation of all state agencies is based on them, but it is equally important to improve their performance.

I will soon sign a number of executive orders connected with the law’s implementation. They include the orders approving the provisions on the Interior Ministry, its central organisation and regional offices. These orders will specify the composition and operating procedures of the Interior Ministry personnel certification committees and the maximum numbers of Interior Ministry officers, including the central office’s staff. 

Another order approves the list of positions and special ranks for the senior officials of the Interior Ministry, the Federal Migration Service, the Bureau for Coordinating the Fight against Organised Crime, and several other organisations. These decisions are of a rather secondary nature, but they play a part too in ensuring the effective climate we need, the right environment for the police to do its job efficiently. 

I want to highlight several important points related to the new law. They are the following:

First is unquestionably the need to fight terrorism which is probably our biggest challenge. Unfortunately, it has historic roots and objective causes. The terrorist attack at Domodedovo Airport revealed the completely unacceptable lack of professionalism in maintaining security measures at various facilities. This has prompted decisions taken by myself and the Minister of the Interior. The new law gives the police substantially expanded powers in ensuring security in public places, and assessing anti-terrorist protection and safety of infrastructure sites. I hope that the police will put these powers to use with maximum effectiveness.

Second is the need for firm action to prevent extremism and attempts to incite interethnic and interfaith hostility. These things are very dangerous for our country.

We are all citizens of a large, multiethnic nation, and here at this table too, as everywhere, of course, we have people of different ethnic backgrounds. You have the necessary laws and possibilities for coordinating your efforts with other agencies and services in this area. We cannot give extremists even the slightest opportunity to destabilise the situation in the country, especially during events of major public importance.

    ”The Law On the Police Force is just the first step in the Interior Ministry’s reorganisation, as is clear to everyone here. Laws are very important of course, and the operation of all state agencies is based on them, but it is equally important to improve their performance.“

Third is the suppression of organized crime. This work must produce much better results. Criminal groups in a number of regions have grafted themselves so tightly to business entities and local authorities that it is impossible in some cases to see where organized crime groups end and business communities or state agencies begin. The Interior Ministry must jointly with the other law enforcement agencies address and prevent these problems.

I remind you that, in response to requests by a number of regional governors, I signed a special order establishing permanent coordination meetings under the regional governors. The reason for this step was to give the governors the possibility where necessary of contacting directly the heads of the regional departments of the Interior Ministry, Federal Security Service, and other law enforcement agencies. At the same time, the heads of the local law enforcement and security agencies can be assured this way that their own appeals will not simply get bogged down somewhere in all the bureaucratic routine. If they see that bandits and government organisations in this or that location have established solid ties between themselves, the governor is obliged in such cases to step in and decide what action to take, because it is not only the police, FSB, and the prosecutor’s office that are responsible for fighting crime, but also the regional governors.

Fourth is to the need to tackle corruption, which remains a direct threat to the country and public interest. People are outraged at the endless money they are still having to hand over on the motor roads, during inspections and audits, and when soliciting all manner of permits and certificates. I receive a huge number of complaints every day on these issues, an enormous number. Almost every second letter I get via electronic channels deals with these kinds of violations. It is all the more dangerous too when people in the law enforcement, supervisory and other government agencies are involved in these kinds of corruption mechanisms. These sorts of connections are used to stifle competitors and often to seize others’ business. It is the police force’s direct duty to identify those who are putting official powers up for sale. This is corruption too. You need to eliminate these corrupt schemes and bring to light attempts to embezzle state funds, working together with other government agencies, of course.

You must pay particular attention to the way investment in big construction projects is being spent, namely, the 2012 APEC summit, the 2013 World University Games in Kazan, the 2014 Sochi Winter Olympics, and now the 2018 Football World Cup as well. These are all big and complex projects, and all of them place a large number of responsibilities on the police.

Fifth is the need for more active development of an integrated information and telecommunications system and the Safe City system, making greater use of navigation and monitoring systems. We just saw how the police are using this system in Moscow’s Northern Administrative District, and I must say that it looks impressive. This is not some screen put on display for the sake of the bosses’ visit, to show that the Interior Ministry personnel know how to use computers, but is a real system that works in practice. You can see vehicles’ location and how tasks are being assigned. The system helps to optimise police cars’ movements and, most important of all, enables the police to react swiftly to the signals coming in, and send cars quicker to where they are needed.

I think the work on improving this system should continue. It is in operation in some other cities too. I have seen something of its work in other places, but it is already more advanced in Moscow, of course. This is a real functioning system, and I hope that, together with video surveillance, it will provide good evidence for criminal and administrative cases and for future disciplinary hearings.

The final point I wanted to make is that this is a big law, and its volume adds to its complexity. It describes in great detail all of the different police powers. I was asked a lot of questions in this respect. People asked, “Is this an increase in police powers, or is it something else?” It is exactly what is required, a detailed series of provisions defining the rights, powers, and duties of the police, and this is just what we need to ensure the police force’s effective and proper operation, while at the same time setting the limits on police powers, so as to avoid the temptation to misuse them.

I think the law is therefore useful, but at the same time, like all laws, it is not ideal, and we have to realise this right from the start. I am sure that as we put the law into practice we will see various proposals and ideas that could be used. Various NGOs have already made proposals on improving the current version. But I want this law to be implemented first, so that we can see what works well in it, and also any oversights, which are inevitable too, and when we find them, we will fix them. 

    ”The terrorist attack at Domodedovo Airport revealed the completely unacceptable lack of professionalism in maintaining security measures at various facilities. This has prompted decisions taken by myself and the Minister of the Interior. The new law gives the police substantially expanded powers in ensuring security in public places, and assessing anti-terrorist protection and safety of infrastructure sites. I hope that the police will put these powers to use with maximum effectiveness.“

Another very important matter related to the law’s enforcement is that the screening process that the law introduces for police officers should result in the best people, the best professionals, joining the new force. Since the entry of the new law into force will be followed by such a certification process, with the best officers joining the new police force, while those who fail to meet the standards not being permitted to serve in the new force, we need to give our new police officers the right kind of better social benefits too. Our police officers must receive a full and broad social benefit package that will guarantee them decent living standards and settle their housing, education, and healthcare issues.

And finally, there is the matter too of raising service pay, which I discussed at a recent meeting with the Government. This concerns Interior Ministry personnel too, including police officers.

Draft laws regulating service in the Interior Ministry and social protection provisions for ministry staff should be submitted to the State Duma for examination soon. I instruct the Government to complete this work together with the Presidential Executive Office and report to me on the results. 

* * *

I will just add a little more before we move on to an exchange of opinions. This truly is a special day, because whatever happens, the introduction of this new law – particularly one as fundamental as the overall Federal Law On the Police Force – will bring about major changes for the system itself, and it is imperative to prepare for these changes. That is precisely why I will issue a whole set of instructions based on the results of today’s meeting. I have already mentioned some of them, but I want to note this fact again.

I am instructing the Government and the Presidential Executive Office to introduce a draft federal law on service in the police, which is to be submitted as a legislative initiative by the President of the Russian Federation to the State Duma. This is a law inextricably tied to the law On the Police Force.

Second, as the Minister and I both just said, it is imperative to refine and present a draft federal law stipulating social guarantees to law enforcement staff, and to submit it to the State Duma as the President of Russia’s legislative initiative.

    ”It is the police force’s direct duty to identify those who are putting official powers up for sale. This is corruption too. You need to eliminate these corrupt schemes and bring to light attempts to embezzle state funds, working together with other government agencies, of course.“

The Government should develop and adopt all the necessary regulations pertaining to the adoption of the Federal Law On the Police Force. They have several months to do so. This should be done as thoroughly as possible, and should include legislative amendments stipulating the transfer of certain functions that under the new law no longer fall under police jurisdiction, to other agencies and organisations.

It is very important to focus on using the media, the internet, and other means of communication to explain the main provisions of the law On the Police Force to the public, because when a new law comes into force, there can be misunderstandings and sometimes even phantom fears, particularly concerning the rights and responsibilities of police officers.

The Ministry of the Interior must develop new criteria for assessing performance of its officers, including the police. The criteria must stipulate the quality of law enforcement and its influence on the overall situation in the country. At the same time, it is imperative to return to the issue we just discussed. I gave instructions to the Presidential Executive Office and jointly with the Interior Ministry it should decide which particular body will ultimately be responsible for registering offences. The Prosecutor General and I have also discussed this, so, Mr Chaika, I would like you to participate in this work as well.

The federal constituent entities will have their share of steps to be made. We are currently in Moscow and the Mayor of Moscow is present. Naturally, a great deal will depend on cooperation between governors and the corresponding police forces and Interior Ministry units.

And another topic. At first glance, it may seem less significant, but it is nevertheless relevant. I just heard a report from the head of the Department of the Interior. A significant proportion of the crimes in Moscow – and therefore, in other parts of our nation as well – is committed by non-residents. This includes both citizens of the Russian Federation from other areas of the country and foreigners – this is particularly relevant for certain categories of crimes such as theft, robbery, violent robbery, and other violent crimes.

What is my point? We often increase the penalties for a given crime. It’s easy to do, but the preventive influence of these amplified sanctions is not that great, although it does have some effect. Still, we need to consider and make definitive decisions on the suggestions concerning penalties for breaking migration laws and registration rules. As far as registration rules are concerned, our situation is different from what it was, say, in the USSR; we no longer have residence permits. Our citizens can and should freely move around the country, but at the same time, freedom of movement does not mean it is acceptable to break existing rules. Thus, the rules of administrative registration must be more effective and clear, and if they are breached, there must be penalties. And those penalties should not just be administrative, such as a small fine which is not of much concern to anybody in such a situation. Indeed, it may be worthwhile to look into criminal prosecution for repeat offenders. In any case, this is one method for monitoring the movement of individuals who do not wish to respect our legislation.

I would like this matter to be tackled by members of the Presidential Council, which works on the development of law enforcement activities, together with other relevant departments: the Prosecutor General’s Office, the Ministry of the Interior, and our social activists who are also addressing these issues, as well as representatives of public and legislative bodies.

USA,16-05-2019 00:00,Donald Trump,Remarks by President Trump on Modernizing Our Immigration System for a Stronger America,"THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you very much, everybody.  Thank you.  Please.  Thank you.  Thank you very much.

We’re here on this very beautiful spring day in the Rose Garden to unveil our plan to create a fair, modern, and lawful system of immigration for the United States.  And it’s about time.  (Applause.)

If adopted, our plan will transform America’s immigration system into the pride of our nation and the envy of the modern world.  Our proposal builds upon our nation’s rich history of immigration, while strengthening the bonds of citizenship that bind us together as a national family.

Throughout our history, we have proudly welcomed newcomers to our shores.  Out of many people, from many places, we have forged one people and one nation under God, and we’re very proud of it.  (Applause.)  We share the same home, we share the same destiny, and we pledge allegiance to the same, great American flag.  (Applause.)

Our policies have turbo-charged our economy.  Now, we must implement an immigration system that will allow our citizens to prosper for generations to come.

Today, we are presenting a clear contrast: Democrats are proposing open borders, lower wages, and, frankly, lawless chaos.  We are proposing an immigration plan that puts the jobs, wages, and safety of American workers first.  (Applause.)

Our proposal is pro-American, pro-immigrant, and pro-worker.  It’s just common sense.  It will help all of our people, including millions of devoted immigrants, to achieve the American Dream.

We are grateful to be joined this afternoon by a tremendous number of people from the House, the Senate, and my Cabinet.  And I love you all, but I won’t introduce you all because I’ll be here all day long.  (Laughter.)  But you’re all here.

Our plan achieves two critical goals.  First, it stops illegal immigration and fully secures the border.  And, second, it establishes a new legal immigration system that protects American wages, promotes American values, and attracts the best and brightest from all around the world.

The proposal begins with the most complete and effective border security package ever assembled by our country — or any other country, for that matter.  (Applause.)  It’s so important.

This plan was not developed, I’m sorry to say, by politicians.  We have a lot of politicians.  But you respect the people and you know the people that have developed this plan.  It was designed with significant input from our great law enforcement professionals to detail what they need to make our border — which is 100 percent operationally secure.  One hundred percent.

Everyone agrees that the physical infrastructure on the border and the ports of entry is gravely underfunded and woefully inadequate.  We scan only a small fraction of the vehicles, goods, and all of the other things coming across, including people.  And, sadly, the drugs pour across our border.  We’re going to stop it.

Investment in technology will ensure we can scan 100 percent of everything coming through, curbing the flow of drugs and contraband, while speeding up legal trade and commerce.  It’s the most heavily traded — monetarily — border anywhere in the world, and it’s not even close.

To make certain that we are constantly making the upgrades we need, our proposal creates a permanent and self-sustaining border security trust fund.  This will be financed by the fees and revenues generated at the border crossings itself.

Importantly, we’re already building the wall, and we should have close to 400 miles built by the end of next year, and probably even more than that.  It’s going up very rapidly.  (Applause.)

And I want to thank the Army Corps of Engineers.  They’re doing a fantastic job on the wall.  And that’s a wall that is desperately needed.

As we close the gaps in our physical framework, we must also close the gaps in our legal framework.  Critical to ending the border crisis is removing all incentives for smuggling women and children.  Current law — (applause).  That’s right.  That’s right.  Women and children.  People have no idea how bad it is unless you’re there, and unless you are a member of law enforcement.  They see it every day, and they can’t believe what they see.

Current law and federal court rulings encourage criminal organizations to smuggle children across the border.  The tragic result is that 65 percent of all border-crossers this year were either minors or adults traveling with minors.  Our plan will change the law to stop the flood of child smuggling and to humanely reunite unaccompanied children with their families back home — and rapidly.  As soon as possible.  (Applause.)

We must also restore the integrity of our broken asylum system.  Our nation has a proud history of affording protection to those fleeing government persecutions.  Unfortunately, legitimate asylum seekers are being displaced by those lodging frivolous claims — these are frivolous claims — to gain admission into our country.

Asylum abuse also strains our public school systems, our hospitals, and local shelters, using funds that we should, and that have to, go to elderly veterans, at-risk youth, Americans in poverty, and those in genuine need of protection.  We’re using the funds that should be going to them.  And that shouldn’t happen.  And it’s not going to happen in a very short period of time.  Have to get this approved.

My plan expedites relief for legitimate asylum seekers by screening out the meritless claims.  If you have a proper claim, you will quickly be admitted; if you don’t, you will promptly be returned home.

Crucially — (applause) — our plan closes loopholes in federal law to make clear that gang members and criminals are inadmissible.  These are some of the worst people anywhere in the world — MS-13 and others.  Inadmissible.  Not coming in.  We’re taking them out all the time by the thousands, a year, but they come in.  They are no longer admissible.  And for criminals already here, we will ensure their swift deportation.  (Applause.)

We will keep our communities safe.  Americans can have complete and total confidence that under this plan, the borders will finally be fully and totally secured.  (Applause.)

And I know a number of our Republican friends and others — Lindsey, I see you sitting right there, and Steve, you’re working on a plan — an immediate plan.  A smaller plan, but a very immediate plan to stop it as of this afternoon.  So, as fast as you can get something done.  This is the big, beautiful, bold plan, but we need something very quickly.  And if you can get it done, that would be fantastic.  Okay?  Thank you.  (Applause.)  Appreciate you working on it.

A topic of less discussion in national media, but of vital importance to our country, is our legal immigration system itself.  Our plan includes a sweeping modernization of our dysfunctional legal immigration process.  It is totally dysfunctional.  The system will finally be fair, transparent, and promote equality and opportunity for all.

Every year, we admit 1.1 million immigrants as permanent legal residents.  These green card holders get lifetime authorization to live and work here and a five-year path to American citizenship.  This is the most prized citizenship anywhere in the world, by far.

Currently, 66 percent of legal immigrants come here on the basis of random chance.  They’re admitted solely because they have a relative in the United States.  And it doesn’t really matter who that relative is.  Another 21 percent of immigrants are issued either by random lottery, or because they are fortunate enough to be selected for humanitarian relief.

Random selection is contrary to American values and blocks out many qualified potential immigrants from around the world who have much to contribute.  While countless — and you wouldn’t believe how many countries, like Canada, create a clear path for top talent.  America does not.

Under the senseless rules of the current system, we’re not able to give preference to a doctor, a researcher, a student who graduated number one in his class from the finest colleges in the world — anybody.  We’re not able to take care of it.  We’re not able to make those incredible breakthroughs.  If somebody graduates top of their class from the best college, sorry, go back to your country.  We want to keep them here.

Companies are moving offices to other countries because our immigration rules prevent them from retaining highly skilled and even, if I might, totally brilliant people.  We discriminate against genius.  We discriminate against brilliance.  We won’t anymore, once we get this passed.  And we hope to get it passed as soon as possible.  (Applause.)

Some of the most skilled students at our world-class universities are going back home because they have no relatives to sponsor them here in the United States.  And that’s the only way.  We want these exceptional students and workers to stay, and flourish, and thrive in America.  (Applause.)  Thank you.

As a result of our broken rules, the annual green card flow is mostly low-wage and low-skilled.  Newcomers compete for jobs against the most vulnerable Americans and put pressure on our social safety net and generous welfare programs.

Only 12 percent of legal immigrants are selected based on skill or based on merit.  In countries like Canada, Australia, and New Zealand — and others — that number is closer to 60 and even 70 and 75 percent, in some cases.

The biggest change we make is to increase the proportion of highly skilled immigration from 12 percent to 57 percent, and we’d like to even see if we can go higher.  (Applause.)  This will bring us in line with other countries and make us globally competitive.

At the same time, we prioritize the immediate family of new Americans — spouses and children.  The loved ones you choose to build a life with, we prioritize.  And we have to do that.  They go right to the front of the line.  Right to the front of the line, where they should be.  (Applause.)

America’s last major overhaul of our legal admissions policy was 54 years ago.  Think of that.  So a major update — and that’s what this is: merit system and a heart system — is long overdue.

The millions of legal immigrants who have come to America over the past half century are now cherished members of our national family.  Going forward — (applause) — it is their interest, and in their interest, and their children’s interest, to adopt a green card system that promotes a rising standard of living for all of our citizens.

Three in four new jobs at the end of last year went to Americans previously out of the workforce.  Our economy is better probably than it ever has been in the history of our country.  (Applause.)  And because of that great economy, we’re able to do things that nobody ever thought possible before, and that’s what we’re going to do for immigration, finally.

Wages are rising but our current immigration system works at cross-purposes, placing downward pressure on wages for the working class, which is what we don’t want to do.

Last year, we also passed historic criminal justice reform.  (Applause.)  And we had tremendous backing — bipartisan — from Democrats, Republicans, conservatives, liberals.  I guess we could also use the word “progressives.”  A new word that’s come about.

Americans with criminal records are getting a second chance at life in higher numbers than ever before.  Unfortunately, the current immigration rules allow foreign workers to substitute for Americans seeking entry-level jobs.  So, foreign workers are coming in and they’re taking the jobs that would normally go to American workers.

America’s immigration system should bring in people who will expand opportunity for striving, low-income Americans, not to compete with those low-income Americans.  (Applause.)

Our proposal fulfills our sacred duty to those living here today, while ensuring America remains a welcoming country to immigrants joining us tomorrow.  And we want immigrants coming in.  We cherish the open door that we want to create for our country, but a big proportion of those immigrants must come in through merit and skill.  (Applause.)

The White House plan makes no change to the number of green cards allocated each year.  But instead of admitting people through random chance, we will establish simple, universal criteria for admission to the United States.  No matter where in the world you’re born, no matter who your relatives are, if you want to become an American citizen, it will be clear exactly what standard we ask you to achieve.  It will be made crystal clear.  (Applause.)

This will increase the diversity of immigration flows into our country.  We will replace the existing green card categories with a new visa, the Build America visa — which is what we all want to hear.  (Applause.)

Like Canada and so many other modern countries, we create an easy-to-navigate points-based selection system.  You will get more points for being a younger worker, meaning you will contribute more to our social safety net.  You will get more points for having a valuable skill, an offer of employment, an advanced education, or a plan to create jobs.

We lose people that want to start companies, and, in many cases, they’re forced to leave our country; go back, usually, to the country where they came from; and they’ll start up companies, and some of those companies are among the biggest and most successful companies today in the world.  They could’ve started them right here in the United States, where they wanted to do it in the first place.  Now they’ll have a chance.  (Applause.)

Priority will also be given to higher-wage workers, ensuring we never undercut American labor.  To protect benefits for American citizens, immigrants must be financially self-sufficient.

Finally, to promote integration, assimilation, and national unity, future immigrants will be required to learn English and to pass a civics exam prior to admission.  (Applause.)

Through these steps, we will deliver an immigration system that respects, and even strengthens, our culture, our traditions, and our values.

Four months ago, I had the honor of participating in a swearing-in ceremony for new Americans, right here in the Oval Office.  It was a beautiful reminder that American citizenship is the most precious gift our nation has to offer.  When we swear in new citizens, we do more than give them a permit; we give them a history, a heritage, a home, and a future of limitless possibilities and potential.

Our nation used to pride ourselves on this capacity: our unique ability to instill the spirit of America into any human heart, into any human being.  Many of the Democrats have claimed to be for these concepts at different times in their careers and, in many cases, in very recent history.  And I hope that they will end up joining me and all of the people gathered together today in putting politics aside, putting security and wages first, and pursuing these historic reforms.  It’s time.  (Applause.)

And if for some reason — possibly political — we can’t get the Democrats to approve this merit-based, high-security plan, then we will get it approved immediately after the election, when we take back the House, keep the Senate, and, of course, hold the presidency.  (Applause.)  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you very much.

But wouldn’t it be nice to do it sooner than that?  (Laughter.)  But it’s not a very long time, is it?  Sixteen months.

One of the reasons we will win is because of our strong, fair, and pro-America immigration policy.  It’s time to restore our national unity and reaffirm our national purpose.  It is time to rebuild our country for all Americans.

Together, we will create an immigration system to make America safer, and stronger, and greater than ever before.

Thank you.  God bless you all.  Thank you very much.  (Applause.)  Thank you.",President,Donald Trump,https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefings-statements/remarks-president-trump-modernizing-immigration-system-stronger-america/,,DEVELOPMENT
Russia,12-07-2004 00:00,Vladimir Putin,Speech at a Ceremony in Honour of the 63rd Anniversary of the Beginning of the Soviet Counter-Attack in the Battle for Moscow," Dear friends, dear veterans,

Every day brings us closer to a great and sacred date for our people – the 60th anniversary of the victory of the Soviet people in the Great Patriotic War, the 60th anniversary of victory in the Second World War, in which our people and our army played a decisive role.

This war was extremely blood and brutal. And only the heroism of our people and the Soviet army could turn the tide of events.

In this sequence of blood battles and heroic victories, the victory near Moscow naturally has special significance. And not just because it made possible to stop the ‘Blitzkrieg’- swift capture of our country, and to break the ‘Barbarossa’ operation. This victory had special significance, because our people and army were able to defend the very heart of our country, our dear Moscow.

This victory was very important and had a special meaning. It became clear that the brutal and cunning enemy could be beaten, and so from this moment on our people became absolutely certain that the enemy would be defeated, and the victory would be ours. And this was the most important moral advantage, a moral victory that our army gave to the country and the world in the battle near Moscow.

From that moment, wide counter-offensives began – from the northern regions of Leningrad to the Black Sea. And all these victories were gained at a very high cost, with much bloodshed, a terrible cost.

We know the role that the heroic divisions of the High Command reserve and from the Far East and Siberia played in this battle.

But we well understand that neither so-called ‘General Winter’, nor the lack of roads in Russia was the main reason for the enemy’s defeat. The loser always finds reasons for his defeat, but our soldiers and our people also faced these same difficulties. But we won because we were stronger in spirit. We won because of the heroism of our people, the skill and selflessness of our soldiers and officers, the people whom today we call veterans.

We will not only preserve the memory of this battle – we will always remember it, and always will be proud of it; and it will always inspire our people to new achievements in the name of our dear Russia.

Thank you.",President,Vladimir Putin,http://en.kremlin.ru/events/president/transcripts/statements/22735,,NATIONALISM
China,23-01-2018 00:00,H.E. Wang Yi,Join Hands Across the Ocean in a New Era,"Your Excellency President Michelle Bachelet,
Colleagues from the Latin American and Caribbean Countries,
Distinguished Guests from the International and Regional Organizations,
Ladies and Gentlemen,
Friends,

Chinese President Xi Jinping attaches high importance to this meeting and sends his congratulatory message. Allow me to read it to you.

""As the second ministerial meeting of the China-CELAC Forum opens, I wish to express, on behalf the government and people of China and in my own name, warm congratulations and extend sincere greetings to President Michelle Bachelet and the delegates of the participating countries and international and regional organizations.

When the first ministerial meeting of the Forum was held in Beijing in January 2015, I attended its opening ceremony. I am happy to see that with our joint efforts in the past three years, the China-CELAC Forum has developed into the main channel for the overall cooperation between China and Latin American and Caribbean (LAC) countries and fruitful progress has been made in wide areas. Today, the two sides are meeting again to review past experience and plan the future, in an effort to elevate China-LAC relations to a higher level.

Our world is undergoing major development, transformation, and adjustment. Countries are increasingly interconnected and interdependent and humankind faces many common challenges. Despite the geographical distance, China and LAC countries are all developing countries, and share the dream of world peace, prosperity and happiness of the people. The Chinese people are ready to join hands with the people of LAC countries to further contribute to the building of a community with a shared future for humankind.

The aim of the Belt and Road Initiative that I put forward four years ago is for China and all interested parties to build a new platform for international cooperation on connectivity and lend fresh impetus to common development. The Initiative has been warmly received by the international community, including many LAC countries. Historically, our ancestors, braving waves of the vast ocean, blazed the trans-Pacific maritime Silk Road between China and LAC countries. Today, we need to draw a new blueprint for our joint effort under the Belt and Road Initiative and open a path of cooperation across the Pacific Ocean that will better connect the richly endowed lands of China and Latin America and usher in a new era of China-LAC relations.

Let us join hands and set sail toward a better future for China-LAC relations and for all humankind!

I wish the meeting a full success!""

That is the end of the message.

Ladies and Gentlemen,
Friends,

In his congratulatory message, President Xi Jinping commended the progress the Forum made in the past three years, and put forward the important proposal of advancing China-LAC relations with Belt and Road cooperation. President Xi's message speaks to China's sincerity in deepening its cooperation with LAC countries in pursuing common development.

-Over the past three years, with the institutional pillars of the Forum put in place, we have steered the Forum onto a track of sound growth. The foreign ministers of China and the CELAC Quartet have held two rounds of dialogue. Our national coordinators have met annually. Dialogue and cooperation platforms have been established in over ten areas including political parties, infrastructure, agriculture, business, scientific and technological innovation, youth, think-tanks, legal affairs, the environment, local government cooperation and non-governmental exchanges. Seventeen sub-forum events have been held, involving the direct participation of over 20,000 people. These events provide us the institutional guarantees in implementing our political consensus and cooperation plans.

-Over the past three years, thanks to our meticulous efforts, cooperation under the Forum has yielded tangible outcomes and helped us gain valuable experience. Following the China-CELAC Cooperation Plan 2015-2019 adopted at the first ministerial meeting, we have vigorously advanced our cooperation in 13 key areas including, among others, political and security affairs, trade, investment and finance. Our mutual political trust has deepened. Twenty-two CELAC countries have established diplomatic ties with China and nine have forged either strategic or comprehensive strategic partnerships with China. Our business cooperation has kept expanding and improving. Despite a sluggish world economy, our annual trade volume has stayed above US$200 billion. The stock of China's non-financial investment in the LAC region has doubled in three years and exceeded US$200 billion. Our financing cooperation has supported over 80 livelihood projects in more than 20 countries.

-Over the past three years, by strengthening people-to-people ties through the Forum, we have consolidated the public support for our relations. Over 1,000 leaders of the political parties from LAC countries have visited China, and 4,000-plus professionals have been to China for training or further education. The China-LAC Science and Technology Partnership and the China-LAC Scientist Exchange Program have been successfully implemented, with 15 scientists from LAC countries going to Chinese research institutes for short-term exchange programs every year. Projects like the China-LAC joint laboratories, demonstration farms and Press Center have come to fruition. The splendid China-LAC Cultural Exchange Year, with its activities across Chinese provinces and cities and in nearly 30 LAC countries, has been the biggest cultural event we jointly hold so far.

The fruitful outcomes we have achieved at the Forum are attributable to our commitment to mutual respect and equality, and to our common pursuit of cooperation and development. Building on the solid foundation we have laid, we need to strive for new progress to take the building of the Forum and our cooperation to a new high, and open up new prospects for China-LAC cooperation. We need to set a new exemplary model for the South-South cooperation, and bring more certainty and positive energy to world peace, stability and prosperity.

Ladies and Gentlemen,
Friends,

At the end of last year, the Communist Party of China successfully convened its 19th National Congress, and outlined an ambitious blueprint for building China into a great modern socialist country that is prosperous, strong, democratic, culturally advanced, harmonious, and beautiful by the middle of this century. General Secretary Xi Jinping emphasized that, the Communist Party of China strives for both the wellbeing of the Chinese people and progress of the entire humankind. He also declared to the world that China will stay committed to peaceful development and to a win-win strategy of opening up. China stands ready to share its development dividends with all other countries and achieve common prosperity together with fellow developing countries. China has the resolve and confidence to explore a way of building a great country, that is different from the one followed by the traditional powers, and will always stand side by side with the LAC countries and all other developing countries. The mission of China's diplomacy in the new era has been identified, that is to work with all other countries to forge a new form of international relations featuring mutual respect, fairness, justice, and win-win cooperation, and to build a community with a shared future for humankind.

The Chinese people believe that actions speak louder than words. Since President Xi first put forward the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) in 2013, it has gained wide support from around the world. Last May, senior officials from over 140 countries and representatives of over 80 international organizations attended in Beijing the first Belt and Road Forum for International Cooperation. At the forum, we reached a consensus to jointly promote BRI cooperation. To date, China has signed intergovernmental agreements on Belt and Road cooperation with more than 80 countries and organizations. China has made over US$50 billion of outbound investment under the Initiative, which has brought nearly 200,000 jobs to relevant countries. A cooperation platform originating from Eurasia, extending to every continent and linking the oceans, the Belt and Road Initiative has shown broad prospects and enormous potential.

The Belt and Road Initiative proposed by China is aimed at providing the world with public goods. It focuses on international economic cooperation and follows the principle of extensive consultation, joint contribution and shared benefits; geopolitical contest or a zero-sum game is neither our purpose nor our practice. We encourage all countries, big and small, to discuss the BRI as equals, to draw on each other's comparative advantages, to tap our potential and to secure win-win cooperation outcomes for all our peoples. The Belt and Road is a platform for open, transparent and inclusive cooperation. We welcome all countries that endorse the Silk Road Spirit to join us.

Ladies and Gentlemen,
Friends,

The consensus we will reach on Belt and Road cooperation at this meeting will be reflected in a special declaration. We hope it will gather fresh momentum and open new prospects for the China-LAC comprehensive cooperative partnership. As we see it, China and LAC countries are well placed to take full advantage of the BRI.

First, we enjoy a time-honored friendship. President Xi has repeatedly mentioned the trans-Pacific maritime Silk Road which connected China and LAC countries. Often referred to as the Nao de China, it started in the mid-16th century, with ships setting out from Fujian, stopping over in Manila and sailing all the way across the Pacific to its final destination-Acapulco. This route enabled the exchange of the East Asia's silk, porcelain and spices for Latin America's corn, potato and chili, and facilitated exchanges between our civilizations. The Nao de China, creating a bond between our peoples, has become part of our collective memory.

Second, we have a solid foundation of cooperation. Since the turn of the century, China-LAC relations have made rapid headway, with our cooperation reaching new heights and our converging interests continuing to expand. China has established free trade areas with Chile, Peru and Costa Rica, concluded trade and investment facilitation arrangements and signed industrial cooperation agreements with many LAC countries. The boom of e-commerce and the digital economy in recent years is creating new opportunities for expanding China-LAC economic ties. Our two sides are also engaged in diverse forms of financial cooperation: over US$17 billion has been allocated as part of China's US$35 billion financial package towards LAC countries, and the US$30 billion China-LAC Industrial Cooperation Investment Fund has been launched, together with the creation of a company that will run the fund.

Third, we have a strong need for mutual cooperation. Latin America and the Caribbean is a region of emerging economies. The LAC countries are striving for development, revitalization and people's wellbeing, and have made ambitious development plans with a strategic vision. It falls to us to seek greater complementarity, to sharpen our economic competitiveness, and to move our industries up the value chain. To this end, Belt and Road cooperation will be a ""golden key"" that unlocks a brighter future for both sides.

Ladies and Gentlemen,
Friends,

I think it would be appropriate to compare China-LAC cooperation to a fruit tree. If we can nourish it with Belt and Road cooperation, it will be more exuberant and bear more fruits, both bilaterally and collectively. Going forward, China stands ready to work with you towards the goal of building a comprehensive cooperative partnership of equality, mutual benefit and common development, which was set by President Xi and the leaders of LAC countries. We hope to deepen the 1+3+6 framework, develop more effective and innovative ways of cooperation, and see to it that it will expand into more areas, improve its structure, gather more momentum and feature higher quality. To this end, China would like to make the following proposals:

First, building a transportation network connecting lands and oceans. As we Chinese often say, prosperity comes with roads and railways. China would like to be your active partner in transportation, infrastructure and energy connectivity projects, support you in building the bi-oceanic railway and the bi-oceanic tunnel, and open more sea routes and direct air links, so as to increase the capacity and density of the transportation networks connecting China and LAC countries. China also stands ready to conclude Belt and Road agreements with more LAC countries, and launch more Belt and Road projects with a view to reaping an ""early harvest"".

Second, fostering a large market open and beneficial to both sides. China will facilitate trade and investment with LAC countries to develop our combined market of two billion consumers. China will host an international import expo every year to open its market to and share its opportunities with the world. We welcome the participation of LAC countries in the inaugural expo to be held this November, and encourage you to export more niche, high-quality goods to China.

Third, developing competitive home-grown industries. To break developmental bottlenecks, LAC countries need to foster home-grown pillar industries with a competitive edge. China has the equipment, technology, funding and training opportunities you need. Our two sides may speed up industrial cooperation; work to build logistics, power and information passages; leverage the synergy of businesses, the public and the government; broaden the financing channels of funds, credit and insurance, and explore the establishment of a consortium of development financial institutions; and build more industrial parks and special economic zones. Hopefully, all this will contribute to the early establishment of an independent and diversified industrial system in LAC countries.

Fourth, seizing the opportunity of innovation-driven growth. China hopes to enhance coordination between the Belt and Road Science, Technology and Innovation Cooperation Action Plan and the development strategies of LAC countries, and build a China-LAC online Silk Road and a digital Silk Road. Our two sides may advance cooperation in the emerging areas such as aerospace and aviation, renewable energy, artificial intelligence, big data, the Internet and bio-medicine. China is ready to help train more researchers from LAC countries through the China-LAC Science and Technology Partnership and the China-LAC Young Scientists Exchange Program. China is working on a big data service platform for ecological and environmental protection and an international coalition for green development, both under the BRI, and welcomes the participation of LAC countries in both initiatives. China also supports small- and medium-sized LAC countries in enhancing their capacity to deal with climate change.

Fifth, carrying out extensive exchanges based on equality and mutual trust. China and LAC countries are all developing countries and emerging economies at a crucial stage of development and revitalization; our countries are exploring development paths suited to our own circumstances. China is ready to share more governance experience with LAC countries, enhance people-to-people ties and exchanges between our political parties, sub-national entities, media organizations, think tanks and youths; and establish more culture centers in each other's countries and more Confucius Institutes in LAC countries to deepen mutual understanding and friendship. In the next three years, we will invite over 600 leaders of political parties from LAC countries to visit China and provide 6,000 government scholarships to LAC countries to strengthen the bonds of friendship between our peoples.

Ladies and Gentlemen,
Friends,

As a Chinese poem reads, ""True friends value their promises to each other and will travel a thousand miles to be together."" Let us make this meeting a new starting point in our relations, seize the opportunity offered by the Belt and Road Initiative, and join hands across the ocean to open a splendid new era of China-LAC relations.

In closing, I wish the second Ministerial Meeting of the China-CELAC Forum a great success!",State Councilor and Foreign Minister of the People's Republic of China,Xi Jinping,https://www.fmprc.gov.cn/mfa_eng/wjdt_665385/zyjh_665391/t1528692.shtml,,DEVELOPMENT
United Kingdom,12-Dec-20,Boris Johnson,PM Climate Ambition Summit opening remarks: 12 December 2020,"Thank you very much Zeinab, thank you Secretary-General Antonio, thank you to my fellow leaders, excellences. Good afternoon from London, where we are coming to the end of an extraordinary and difficult year, I think with a sudden surge of scientific optimism. Because after barely 12 months of the pandemic, we’re seeing the vaccine going into the arms of the elderly and vulnerable, vaccines that have been products each and every one of them of vast international efforts in laboratories around the world. And so my message to you all, is that together we can use scientific advances to protect our entire planet, our biosphere against a challenge far worse, far more destructive even than coronavirus. By the promethean power of our invention we can begin to defend the earth against the disaster of global warming. And by that I mean that together we can reduce our emissions, we can radically cut our dependence on fossil fuels, we can change our agricultural practices, and in short we can reverse the process by which for centuries, humanity has been quilting our planet in a toxic tea-cosy of greenhouse gases. And at the same, we can create hundreds of thousands of jobs, millions of jobs across the planet as we collectively recover from coronavirus. If you doubt our ability to do that, let me tell you that when I was a child of six, this country depended on coal for 70% of our energy needs. That coal dependency is now down to 3% or less and since 1990, the UK has cut our CO2 emissions by 43% - more than any other G20 nation – and yet our economy has grown by 75%. Today, we’re putting our foot to the accelerator – in a carbon friendly way of course – with a Ten Point Plan for a Green Industrial Revolution. We want to turn the UK into the Saudi Arabia of wind power generation, enough wind power by 2030 to supply every single one of our homes with electricity. We’re going ahead with massive solar programme, even though we can’t hope to emulate the incredible things being done by India, Australia or Morocco for instance. Hydro of course - we’re liberating the awesome potential of hydrogen, whether for homes or all sorts of uses. On electric vehicles we’re going to ban ICEs, new internal combustion engines by 2030, with a very ambitious programme. We’ll continue to develop new nuclear power. We want to lengthen the lead of London, the UK, as the natural home of green finance. We want our homes to be emitting progressively less and less CO2 and doing more and more retrofitting of our homes. And wherever the UK may be accused of lagging, we won’t be lagging my friends in lagging. We want to encourage all modes of green transport, cycling, walking and so on. We want to use the relatively new miracle of carbon capture and storage actually to take carbon from power generation and industrial processes and bury it in under-sea caverns created by the extraction of hydrocarbons. And we’re now consecrating 30% of our waters, 30% of our land surface, to nature, because we think wild nature is the best way and most effective way of retaining carbon in a natural balance. We do all these things because they’re right for the world, they’re right for our country – but also because we know that this green industrial revolution will generate as I say hundreds of thousands of high skilled, high paying, good quality jobs for generations to come. And we’re going to help our friends around the world by moving away from supporting drilling and mining for hydrocarbons, but putting £11.6 billion of our overseas aid to support green technology and decarbonisation across the planet. We want to work with all of you on this call, on this conference – let’s do it together. Let’s make it our collective commitment, as Antonio has just said, to get to net zero by 2050. We in the UK, as he says, are going to do our bit, we’re reducing our emissions by 68% at least on 1990 levels over the next decade. And I’m really awed and humbled by the efforts of other countries around the world to set their own targets. And I just want to repeat that key message. We’re doing this not because we are hair shirt-wearing, tree-hugging, mung bean-munching eco freaks – though I’ve got nothing against any of those categories, mung beans are probably delicious. We’re doing it because we know that scientific advances will allow us collectively as humanity to save our planet and create millions of high skilled jobs as we recover from COVID. So thank you all very much for joining this conference, this Ambition Summit, thank you to Secretary General Antonio, thank you to my co-host Emmanuel Macron, who I know shares my keen interest in protecting the ecosystems of our seas and oceans, and I look forward to seeing you all in Glasgow face-to-face next year.",Prime Minister,Boris Johnson,https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/pm-climate-ambition-summit-opening-remarks-12-december-2020,,DEVELOPMENT
Russia,27-02-2003,Vladimir Putin,Opening Remarks at a Meeting of the State Council on the Development of Mortgage and Other Measures to Stimulate Housing Construction,"On our agenda is without exaggeration a vital issue, a vital theme: the housing problem. It has always been one of the most sensitive and significant issues for the people of our country. Not only for our country, but especially for our country. It is still a relevant task today in the new economic and social conditions.

Experts estimate that about 60% of Russian citizens need to improve their housing conditions. For the most part people seek to obtain housing built by municipal authorities and government agencies. Nearly 10% of Russian families are on various waiting lists today. And 2.5 million people still live in decrepit or dangerous housing.

In reality the situation is that given the current rate of the building of departmental and municipal housing it will take another 20 years to provide housing for those who are on the waiting list alone.

One can cite many figures and similar facts. They all point in one direction: the housing problem remains very acute in Russia as a whole. On the one hand, the former mechanism of housing allocation has practically ceased working. On the other hand, the housing market has not been fully put in place. In addition, the prices of housing are high and out of reach for the majority of Russian citizens.

We must however, look for ways out of this situation. It is our duty to take the housing problem off the shelf and to address it with a clear-cut plan in mind.

The State Council’s working group has submitted good material. We discussed it many times with the Governor of the Samara Region, and he has long been into this problem. I know that he has been trying to offer his program to the Government for a long time. Let us lend him an ear today.

In this connection I would like you to concentrate not on analyzing the causes of the current situation but on suggesting practical ways to change it. Especially as regards the creation of mechanisms that enable people to buy housing.

One such mechanism, of course, is mortgage loans, which is to be our subject of discussion today. Throughout the world it is the most effective and civilized mechanism of dealing with housing problems. The mortgage loan is a well-tried and reliable way of attracting private investments. And we are talking not so much about foreign as about domestic investors.

I suggest that we focus on the following during our discussion today.

First, I would like to stress that the system of mortgage crediting must be market-based and not subsidy-based. Only then shall we be able to attract the amount of funds matching the scale of the housing problem in the country.

However, the majority of the mortgage mechanisms and schemes already operating in the regions are oriented towards budget financing. That undermines the very idea of a mortgage and contradicts its main goals and principles. The Government, of course, is to play the leading role. It must contribute to the creation of institutions that are necessary to organize a market of mortgage loans and formulate a clear legal framework.

As for budgetary means they should be used to provide targeted subsidies to families who cannot afford a mortgage loan.

Another aspect of the problem is making mortgage loans accessible. Mortgage loans must become not only accessible but habitual, operating as the norm and not as an exception.

Assessments vary, but most experts believe that many families with stable incomes can afford to take out a mortgage loan, provided of course, that incomes grow steadily.

Besides, mortgage securities must be almost as reliable as government securities. The taxation of all the mortgage operations must take into account the long-term character of mortgage.

That dictates the need to finalize the necessary regulatory and legal framework. That is the third area of effort that merits special attention. I am sure we are going to discuss it because experts know that some elements of the mortgage system are not working and some need to be changed if they are to work.

The draft Housing Code is currently being finalized. It is necessary to speed up the drafting of the law on mortgage securities and to introduce amendments to the laws that have to do with mortgage directly or indirectly.

Another area where more work is needed is forming the infrastructure of mortgage crediting. A corresponding agency has been created and its experience and professional opinion must be taken into account.

I think you would agree with me that so far the word “mortgage” mystifies our citizens. And we must do some explaining, create mechanisms to explain the substance of this procedure, the essence of this mechanism. It is necessary that people come to believe that it can be used to solve the acute problem of housing.

Russia,26-09-2008,Dmitry Medvedev,Opening Address at a Meeting with Commanders of Military Districts,"Dear friends!

Today the operational and strategic exercises Centre-2008, conducted within the framework of the Stability-2008 strategic exercises, have been successfully completed. First and foremost I would especially like to emphasise the ability of the military bodies concerned with strategy in Central Asia to respond quickly and adequately to modern threats.

The exercises were a success. I congratulate all those who participated in the exercises, in their preparation and carrying them out, on their results. It is especially important that the troops of the Volga-Urals Military District met the challenges that were set them in close cooperation at one stage with our allies in the CSTO (Collective Security Treaty Organisation) — the Armed Forces of the Republic of Kazakhstan.

The main forces that participated in the last phase have been listed, but I cannot help but reiterate here in the presence of the media that 47,000 people and 134 supervising bodies took part in the exercises.

The name of the exercises speaks for itself and is deeply symbolic today. Stability is precisely what our government is seeking and what we must uphold in a variety of situations, if required by using military force.

Just recently we had to react to the aggression launched by the Georgian regime and, as we have seen, an absolutely real war can erupt suddenly and local simmering conflicts, which are sometimes even called frozen, can turn into a real military fire.

During the operation the Russian Armed Forces forced Georgia to make peace and achieved its objectives with honour. Our troops showed proof of high morale and combat training. We can say honestly that the actions of our troops saved tens of thousands of lives. For their courage and heroism 1491 soldiers have been awarded state decorations, some of them posthumously.

Today it is vital to make a realistic assessment of the global military and political situation and have a clear understanding of potential threats. And developments in South Ossetia only exacerbated the need to find an urgent solution to these problems.

As you know, just recently I adopted refined parameters for the military composition of our Armed Forces until 2020. To be effective in combat missions our Armed Forces should take the five following aspects into account in their development.

First, I am referring to improving the organisational and personnel structures and the systems which oversee how troops are organised. To speak simply and frankly all military compounds and units must change to become permanently combat ready.

The second challenge is improving the efficiency with which the Armed Forces are managed. If we do not do so it will be impossible to count on success in today's wars and other armed conflicts.

The third issue involves improving the system of personnel training, military education and military science: we have done so before and this is an absolutely imperative task right now.

And, finally, fourthly, of course we need an army which is equipped with sophisticated weapons. We will also give high priority to this issue. Fundamentally new, high-technology weapons will play a particular role in this regard.

And finally, last but not least, I would like to mention the social aspects of the Armed Forces ranging from wages, housing conditions, and everyday living to a wide variety of other issues.

These five factors will determine the efficiency of our Armed Forces in combat.

By 2020 we must guarantee our capacities of nuclear deterrence in various military and political conditions, in various military and political situations, as well as ensure the comprehensive provision of new types of weapons and means of gathering intelligence.

In addition, we must have also achieved superiority in the air, in conducting high-precision strikes on land and sea targets, as well as the rapid transfer of troops.

We have planned to construct a series of warships. First and foremost nuclear submarine cruisers with cruise missiles and multipurpose submarines. We will also establish an air-space defence system.

Of course I have not listed everything that we need to do to change the image of the Armed Forces. This work will be carried out through to 2020, but the most important thing is that by December we already have a clear plan of action for the future.

Social security for troops and their families remains one of our priorities. The structure of wages should encourage soldiers to faithfully perform their duties and improve their skills. I am of course referring to the new structure of wages which should be implemented already next year while maintaining the supplementary payments that servicemen and other members of personnel presently receive.

I know that by the end of 2008 the Ministry of Defence plans to obtain more than 28 thousand apartments and maybe more — at any rate this is the rough number. We are working on the acquisition of housing and participating in the construction of housing for troops with funds derived from the reappropriation of property that has been vacated.

In general the drafts of the 2009 federal budget and the plans for 2010 and 2011 contain provisions that the Ministry of Defence will address housing issues with a sum of 135,800 million rubles. This is a large amount of money that will allow for the construction of more than 67,000 apartments. By the end of 2010 no fewer than 22,000 troops must receive housing through the implementation of a programme of state housing certificates. Before 2012 the necessary number of service apartments will be built, as we agreed.

You know that we have adopted a federal target programme that will address the social problems of contract servicemen. It covers the period from 2009 to 2015 and provides for funding from the federal budget for the construction of hostels, kindergartens, schools as well as cultural and recreational centres. All of this must also be addressed.

The tasks with regards to providing permanent housing by 2010 and service housing by 2012 should be strictly implemented. The question should be constantly monitored (in this respect I am addressing the Minister of Defence).

Once again I would like to thank you for preparing and conducting these exercises. We have not carried out anything like this in the past 20 years, neither in Russia nor even in the Soviet Union.

Thank you. I wish you success and good luck.",President,Dmitry Medvedev,http://en.kremlin.ru/events/president/transcripts/statements/1535,,OTHERS
Russia,04-02-2020 00:00,Vladimir Putin,Address to the Nation,"Citizens of Russia, friends,

The non-work week in Russia is coming to an end. However, doctors, nurses and all medical personnel continue to work intensely.

It is a difficult time for them now. They are holding the line of defence against the advancing epidemic: they are treating and saving people as well as preventing the contraction and development of the disease. I am confident that all Russians will share my heartfelt gratitude to our medical personnel.

People working in other fields that are vital for Russia and society are also doing their duty now. I would like to sincerely thank you all, without exception.

And, of course, I would like to thank volunteers and people who care, everyone who understood and felt their personal responsibility in countering the epidemic and who strictly follow the recommendations of the authorities and medical specialists, take care of themselves, their families and the safety of those around them.

The nationwide non-work week as well as the self-isolation regime declared in many regions made it possible for us to gain time to take preventive action, to mobilise all the government bodies and to increase the healthcare system’s resources to counter the epidemic as effectively as possible using our own experience and the best practices from other countries.

I believe it of great importance that overall we have managed to protect the elderly from the serious threat so far and prevent outbreaks of the epidemic at kindergartens, schools, universities and other educational institutions.

Of course, now we have to think about our next steps and decisions. Let me stress that when making decisions we have to understand that the threat is still present. Virologists believe that the global peak of the epidemic is still ahead of us, including in Russia.

In this context, I have decided to prolong the official non-work period until the end of the month, or through April 30. Let me stress that wages will be retained.

At the same time, the situation is changing, and it is different in different regions and even in individual municipalities. We have a very large country with varying population densities and regions where the coronavirus has already created a serious threat to people. This applies, for one, to Moscow where the trend has not been reversed yet despite the measures taken by the federal and municipal authorities. Meanwhile, there are regions where not a single case of the disease has been identified, although there are fewer of them as time goes on.

Therefore, restrictions should be tightened in some regions, whereas local, spot solutions may be sufficient in others with a high level of preparedness. These specific distinctions must be taken into account.

In this context, the regional heads will be granted additional authority in line with my Executive Order. By the end of this week, they will have to plan out a set of specific preventive measures that are the most rational for their regions in terms of the health and security of the people and the sustainability of the economy and key elements of the infrastructure.

Let me repeat that the regions themselves will make decisions that are based largely on the objective situation. These decisions should determine what regime to introduce in a region or its individual municipalities under the presidential Executive Order, which companies and organisations need to suspend their activities and which can continue operating with strict observance of public health.

Let me add that, as before, work will continue at government bodies, companies with continuous production, medical facilities and pharmacies, shops selling the basic necessities and all vital services.

If there is a need to impose additional restrictions on backbone companies and educational and research organisations, the regions will have to coordinate the decision with the Federal Government.

It is critical to ensure interaction between different levels of government, including the federal, regional and municipal governments. I therefore asked my plenipotentiary envoys in the federal districts to closely coordinate this work in the regions. All information must go to the Government Coronavirus Effort Coordinating Board for processing and analysis and be used in decision-making.

Of course, the regional authorities must coordinate their actions with the sanitary and epidemiological authorities. The key and unconditional goal here is proper protection, health and safety of the Russian people.

We will see where the situation goes from here and make further decisions and, situation permitting, will adjust the duration of the announced period of compulsory days off to reduce it.

I have another point to make. As we implement measures to combat the epidemic, we must not forget that it is just as important to preserve jobs and incomes. This is a common priority for the Government, the regional authorities and for businesses. An efficient and steadily performing economy provides the basis for achieving our key goals, including in healthcare.

Fellow citizens, please continue to strictly follow the instructions issued by the authorities and the recommendations of the doctors and specialists, and to protect yourself and your loved ones.

Our shared responsibility and mutual support remain extremely important and, in some cases, decisive. Even this short week has shown that with the proper understanding of the complexity of the situation, we can manage to reduce the risks effectively. I am sure that we will continue to act in the same coordinated and reliable manner. Most importantly, we must be proactive.

Thank you. Stay well.",President,Vladimir Putin,http://en.kremlin.ru/events/president/transcripts/statements/63133,,DEVELOPMENT
China,21-05-2015 00:00,Li Keqiang,Promoting China-Latin America Common Development by Upgrading China-Brazil Cooperation,"Your Excellency President Dilma Rousseff,
Members of the Business Communities,
Friends,
Ladies and Gentlemen,

Good morning! It is a great pleasure for me to meet so many friends from the business communities. I last visited Brazil 12 years ago. Now back in this country after a decade or so, I am deeply impressed by the enormous achievements in Brazil's economic and social development. Before landing in Brasilia, I had a bird's eye view from the air of the vast forests, wide rivers and fertile fields of this fascinating country and was amazed by its vibrant and growing vitality.

Brazil is one of the world's principal emerging economies and the true leader in the economic development and regional integration of Latin America. Since the beginning of the 21st century, Brazil has made remarkable achievements in development, with its GDP now ranking the seventh place in the world and its people's income rising steadily. The international community has high expectations for Brazil's development prospects.

China-Brazil relations have made much headway in recent years. During President Xi Jinping's successful visit to Brazil last July, the two sides agreed to advance their comprehensive strategic partnership to a higher level, which would cover wider areas and stand on a larger stage. Our two countries now enjoy deeper political trust, frequent cultural and people-to-people exchanges and rapidly expanding trade and economic ties. Brazil is China's largest trading partner in Latin America and China Brazil's largest trading partner for six consecutive years. By the end of last year, the number of Chinese companies operating in Brazil had totalled over 100. Brazilian businesses are also making more investment in China. The two countries conduct effective strategic coordination on international and multilateral affairs. Our relations have gone beyond the bilateral context and assumed an increasing global dimension.

China and Brazil are both developing countries. Yet our economies have deeply integrated into the world economy. With global economic recovery remaining weak under mounting downward pressure, both China and Brazil are confronted with challenges. To grow the economy and improve the quality of people's life is an urgent task for both of us that requires greater development through structural reform and further opening-up. The Chinese economy is under considerable downward pressure, but the targeted measures of macro-regulation introduced late last year have produced initial results and the economy is growing within a proper range in the first four months of this year. Our target for 2015 is a growth rate of around 7% for an economy of a US$10 trillion, with the increment outpacing any of the previous years. We have the capability and confidence to achieve this target so as to maintain the medium-high growth rate of the economy. China cannot achieve economic development in isolation from the rest of the world and we will therefore open ourselves still wider to the world. We hope that Brazil will continue to made steady progress while braving economic headwinds. As two major emerging economies, China and Brazil have a shared responsibility to deepen their mutually beneficial cooperation and make greater contribution to global recovery while effectively taking on their respective challenges.

We need to deepen production capacity cooperation. To get the world economy out of its current difficulties, we must identify areas for new breakthroughs. With the developed countries pushing for re-industrialization and the developing countries speeding up their industrialization and urbanization, development of the real economy has become the imperative. Mutual complementarity of the industries is needed not only between the developing and developed countries but also among developing countries. China and Brazil may well establish a model of such mutual complementarity in the area of production capacity cooperation. Continued industrialization and infrastructure development in Brazil require raw materials and equipment. In both areas, China is known to have abundant and high-quality production capacities. If our enterprises can strengthen cooperation and relocate superior Chinese capacities to Brazil by setting up factories turning out steel, building materials and relevant equipment, it will help Brazil cut the building cost of infrastructure development, curb inflation, boost domestic demand, increase employment and upgrade its industrialization, thus bringing benefit to both sides. If more Chinese equipment goes overseas, it will help China to adjust its economic structure, upgrade its industries, and improve its import and export mix, while addressing the existing imbalances in global economic development. China and Brazil are both of the view that a railway connecting the Pacific and the Atlantic should become the model project for production capacity cooperation between the two sides. What is more, China will cooperate with Brazil to add 28 large transportation vessels to its fleet in favor of greater oceangoing capacity and efficiency. China is ready to provide Brazil with pre-salt oil exploration and extraction services and marine engineering equipment to improve its energy development. Our enterprises can also work together in the development of nuclear power, hydro-power, photovoltaic power and other forms of clean energy in favor of sustainable development.

We need to jointly promote a diversified trade structure. With falling commodity prices being the main feature of the volatile international market, the volume of China's import has not dropped significantly. As the largest buyer of Brazil's soybean, iron ore, crude oil and other commodities, China is ready to build a long-term and stable trade relationship with Brazil by concluding a bilateral cooperation package. China will resume importing Brazilian beef, and Brazil will buy Chinese vehicles in building the Olympic facilities. This will benefit Brazilian farmers, Chinese consumers and business firms of both countries, as it serves to improve the quality of the respective imports and exports and lead to a diversified structure in the two-way trade.

We need to actively promote science, technology and education exchanges and cooperation. Science and technology should figure more prominently in our cooperation. We need to make good use of our high-level dialogue mechanisms in science, technology and innovation, advance our R&D and launch cooperation under the China-Brazil Earth Resources Satellite program and explore the establishment of joint labs, science and technology parks, and business R&D centers. China would like to see more Brazilian young people to study in China through the ""Science Knows No Border"" program and encourage more Chinese university students to study Portuguese in Brazil.

Ladies and Gentlemen,

Brazil is the first leg of my visit to Latin America. After Brazil, I will visit Colombia, Peru and Chile. With a high concentration of developing countries and emerging economies, Latin America wields an important political, economic and cultural influence internationally. We are of the view that Latin America is a key cornerstone for international peace and stability. Free from large-scale wars for more than 100 years, the continent has made steady progress in regional integration and got the ""Latin American voice"" heard loud and clear in major international affairs. Latin America is an emerging source of global prosperity and growth. Since the turn of the century, it has maintained an annual growth rate of over 4%, achieved a per capita GDP of US$10,000 and made a 14% contribution to global economic growth. Latin America is also an outstanding example of inter-civilization inclusiveness, where harmonious co-existence of diverse cultures has made the continent all the more charming and colorful.

China and Latin America enjoy a profound traditional friendship and ever closer cooperation in all areas. During his visit to Latin America last year, President Xi Jinping met with Latin American leaders and proposed a five-dimensional relationship between the two sides. The first ministerial meeting of the China-CELAC Forum was held last January, which adopted a five-year plan for China-Latin America cooperation and brought bilateral relations to a new historical starting point. My current visit will focus on consolidating our traditional friendship, and deepening our practical cooperation in the context of enhanced global cooperation with priority given to breakthroughs in production capacity cooperation, transformation of China-Latin America trade and economic relations, and upgrading of China-Latin America cooperation.

First, global economic recovery hinges on international production capacity cooperation. At present, the global economy is in a period of profound adjustment. To jumpstart the sluggish economy, countries need to promote structural reform and adjustment at home and step up cooperation internationally. We can create new growth drivers for global economy and national development if we succeed in international production capacity cooperation beginning in the infrastructure sector. Developing countries need more infrastructure and developed ones also need to upgrade their infrastructure, which requires various kinds of equipment, ranging from engineering machinery, transport vehicles to metal processing, construction materials and manufacturing facilities. China is in the position to provide cost-effective equipment in these areas. Strengthening infrastructure and production capacity cooperation will be an effective way for China and Latin America to overcome the downward pressure, in the interest of rolling back trade protectionism, promoting world economic transformation and advancing peaceful development.

Second, economic transformation and upgrading in China and Latin America requires support from bilateral production capacity cooperation. From a long-term point of view, Latin America should not limit itself to being a ""global supplier"" of primary products, nor China being a ""world factory"" of cheap products forever. The existing trade pattern characterized by exchange of general manufacturing items for energy and mineral products is not sustainable, as both sides need to go for industrial upgrading, adjustment and transformation. If Latin America develops a resource-based processing industry, it will help change its single-product economy. And China has worked to build a strong equipment industry that competes internationally as the direction of its industrial upgrading. China buys quality industrial and agricultural products from Brazil, while Brazil imports power generation equipment, subway trains and other products from China. Such exchanges of competitive products can lead to added value for their trade. China is ready to sign more FTA agreements with Latin American countries with a view to advancing trade liberalization and facilitation and injecting fresh impetus into bilateral production capacity cooperation.

Third, all-win outcome should be the booster to drive China-Latin America production capacity cooperation forward. Such cooperation aims not only to increase mutual benefit but to stay open and inclusive. Chinese companies are ready to join companies from developed countries in conducting trilateral cooperation in Latin America. In terms of technological sophistication and international division of labor, developed countries generally tend to be at the medium-to-higher end of the industrial chain while China and Latin America are generally at the medium-to-lower end. By working together, we can move our economies up the value chain, which is consistent with the law of industrial relocation. China's equipment industry is strong in its integration capability that has assimilated many advanced technologies from developed countries. Working together can help us scale new heights in our openness and cooperation.

Fourth, delivering benefits of development to our people is the ultimate purpose of China-Latin America production capacity cooperation. Chinese companies investing and operating in Latin American countries must respect laws, regulations, cultures and customs of the land, create more jobs for local communities, pay adequate attention to environmental protection, do a good job in personnel training and technological transfer, and act enthusiastically to meet their social responsibilities. Chinese investment and financing is not attached with any political condition. China and Latin America both stand opposed to such short-term behaviors as putting profits before principles and are both committed to inclusive growth.

Here, I would like to propose a ""3x3"" model for China-Latin America production capacity cooperation:

― Build three channels of logistics, electric power and IT in response to the needs of Latin American countries. Infrastructure connectivity in South America is a common goal of all Latin American countries. Chinese companies are ready to work with their counterparts in Latin America to jointly build a railway-based logistics channel that spans South America and the Caribbean, an electric power transmission channel that connects all countries and regions in Latin America complete with efficient power transmission and smart grid technologies, and an IT channel backed by Internet technologies, new-generation mobile communications technologies and integrated big data and cloud computing.

― Put in place a new model of cooperation consistent with market economy laws featuring sound interactions among the three actors of company, society and the government. As China and Latin America all practise market economy, their production capacity cooperation should be market-oriented. Companies of the two sides can carry out project cooperation by way of joint venture, PPP and franchising while following the principle of ""company-led, commercially-based operation, public participation and government support"" to implement the relevant projects in an expeditious way. China will encourage its companies to localize their operation and to heed the opinions of the local trade unions and communities. Governments of the two sides need to speed up their conclusion of an investment treaty, update their agreement on avoidance of double taxation, improve service efficiency, bring down business cost and create an enabling business environment for companies.

― Expand three financing channels of funds, credit and insurance in support of bilateral cooperation projects. I wish to announce here that China will set up a special fund for China-Latin America production capacity cooperation complete with US$30 billion in support of relevant projects. China is ready to set up a financial leasing company to help meet the equipment needs of Latin America such as large oil tankers, liquefied natural gas carriers and off-shore oil rigs. China will also improve its mid-to-long-term export credit insurance mechanism to help Chinese companies doing export business in Latin America. China is ready to expand cooperation with Latin American countries in the areas of currency swap and local currency settlement so as to promote the development of the real economy and jointly maintain the stability of regional and global financial markets.

Ladies and Gentlemen,

This morning, President Rousseff and I had a productive meeting, during which we had an in-depth discussion and reached broad consensus on China-Brazil cooperation in all areas, and signed or witnessed the signing of a number of cooperation agreements. Today's business summit has been a great success, evidenced by the strong turnout of entrepreneurs from both sides and the fruitful results it has achieved. I wish to express my sincere congratulations on that.

As a Latin American proverb goes, ""When people join hands, they will be invincible."" We also have an old Chinese saying that goes, ""People of one mind can remove Mount Tai."" As two giants on the shores of the Pacific and Atlantic, China and Brazil can accomplish anything and overcome any difficulty, as long as they go forward hand in hand with one heart and one mind. I hope our entrepreneurs from both sides will display the best of their talent, seize the opportunities to take our all-round cooperation to a new high and keep on working hard for the development of the respective countries and regions, thus ushering in a better future of China-Latin America friendship.

Thank you.",Premier,Xi Jinping,https://www.fmprc.gov.cn/mfa_eng/wjdt_665385/zyjh_665391/t1271929.shtml,,INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS
USA,06-06-2019 00:00,Donald Trump,Remarks by President Trump Before Air Force One Departure,"THE PRESIDENT:  So, we’re going together to Normandy, and it’s going to be something really special.  It looks like the weather is beautiful, but who knows; it changes fast.  I think it’s going to be an incredible, special day in a very special and very important place.  So I look forward to that.

As you know, Mexico was in yesterday.  They’re coming back this morning, in Washington.  They’ll be meeting at the White House.  I think a lot of progress was made yesterday, but we have to make a lot of progress.  Mexico has been making, for many, many years, hundreds of mill- — of billions of dollars.  They’ve been making an absolute fortune on the United States.  They have to step up, and they have to step up to the plate, and perhaps they will.  We’re going to see.  They can solve the problem.

The Democrats — Congress has been a disaster.  They won’t change.  They won’t do anything.  They want free immigration — immigration to pour into our country.  They don’t care who it is.  They don’t care what kind of a record they have.  It doesn’t make any difference.  They’re not going to be changing anything.  We go to them, we say, “Let’s fix the immigration laws.”  They just want it to do badly.  The worse it does, the happier they are.

So that’s the way it is, and, I guess, that’s the way it’ll be until after the election.  It’s a disgrace.  Because, frankly, we could solve this problem so easy if the Democrats in Congress were willing to make some changes, but they’re not.  And that’s the way it is.  They want to just ride it out.  They want to have a real bad time.  They don’t care about crime.  They don’t care about drugs pouring into our country.  They couldn’t care less.  It’s all politics.  It’s a vicious business.  So that’s the way it is.

But we’re having a great talk with Mexico.  We’ll see what happens.  But something pretty dramatic could happen.  We’ve told Mexico the tariffs go on.  And I mean it, too.  And I’m very happy with it.  And lot of people, senators included, they have no idea what they’re talking about when it comes to tariffs.  They have no — absolutely no idea.

When you have the money, when you have the product, when you have the thing that everybody wants, you’re in a position to do very well with tariffs, and that’s where we are.  We’re the piggybank.  The United States is the piggybank.  It has all the money that others want to take from us, but they’re not taking it so easy anymore.  It’s a lot different.

Our talks with China — a lot of interesting things are happening.  We’ll see what happens.  In the meantime, we’re getting 25 percent on $250 billion, and I can go up another at least $300 billion.  And I’ll do that at the right time.

But I think China wants to make a deal badly.  I think Mexico wants to make a deal badly.  And I’m going to Normandy.

United Kingdom,31-Dec-10,David Cameron,New Year podcast,"A transcript of a podcast recorded by Prime Minister David Cameron to mark the New Year. Read the transcript: Prime Minister: After eight months in this job, I am acutely conscious of the challenges we face as a country. But I begin this New Year in the same positive frame of mind as when I set out the task of starting a new government back in May. By nature I am an optimist - about people, about human nature and, above all, about the future of our great country. If we sort out our problems, and make the most of our many opportunities, we can be one of the international success stories of the new decade. As for politics, my approach is simple: politics is public service in the national interest. We all have our dreams, ambitions and principles that we cherish and want to put into place. But most important of all, particularly at times like this, is to deal with the real problem in front of us. And there can be no doubt what that is: the state of our economy and the budget deficit. We have been living seriously beyond our means. We have to sort this out. Every sensible person knows this. The national interest dictates that we do the right thing, which is to act, not the easy thing, which would be to delay. In doing so, we should be clear: Britain has a really bright future to look forward to. 2011 is going to be a difficult year, as we take hard but necessary steps to sort things out. But the actions we are taking are essential, because they are putting our economy and our country on the right path. Together, we can make 2011 the year that Britain gets back on its feet. Eight months ago we inherited an economy in deep trouble. The previous government had racked up the biggest budget deficit in our peacetime history. We only have to look at what’s been happening in Greece or Ireland to see the kind of danger we were in. Rising interest rates. Falling confidence. Others questioning whether you are still credit-worthy as a country. And, remember, the deficit we inherited back in May was actually forecast to be bigger than that of Ireland or Greece - or any other developed country for that matter. But we have pulled Britain out of that danger zone. Through the Budget and the Spending Review we’ve taken some really tough decisions to rescue our public finances and fundamentally change the direction of our economy. The new independent Office for Budget Responsibility forecasts the economy will grow continuing into 2011 and growth will rise further in 2012. So we have a credible plan for restoring confidence in our economy. But we have to see it through. A lot of the heavy lifting will happen in 2011. Each and every Minister in this Government is acutely aware that the plans we have in place are tough, in fact incredibly difficult, but we are clear that the alternative - indecision and delay - would mean taking unacceptable risks with our economy, our country and our people. I didn’t come into politics to make cuts. Neither did Nick Clegg. But in the end politics is about national interest, not personal political agendas. We’re tackling the deficit because we have to - not out of some ideological zeal. This is a government led by people with a practical desire to sort out this country’s problems, not by ideology. When we talk of building a bigger, stronger society, we mean it. These debts are not the Government’s debts, they are the country’s debts. We are all in this together. As we deal with the deficit we are protecting the things people cherish the most - like the National Health Service and the old age pension that we are re-linking to earnings. We want to take people with us. The Coalition - two distinct political parties, working together to tackle a national economic emergency - is the embodiment of that spirit. Now of course Coalition politics is not always straightforward. We don’t agree on everything. We never said we would. But I believe we are bringing a new style of government. A more collegiate approach. One where we’re prepared to argue things out and then act to do what we both believe is in the national interest. The political risks are greater this way. But so too are the rewards. As a Coalition government we are governing to the needs of the country. And, in the last eight months, I believe that the government has been decisive, bold and determined. We must maintain that drive in the months and years ahead. As we start 2011, our priorities should be about enterprise, aspiration, the modernisation of our public services and the security of our people. First, enterprise. Uppermost in my mind as we enter the New Year is jobs. Now ultimately it’s not government that creates jobs - it’s businesses, entrepreneurs, wealth creators. And that is particularly true when governments are so deeply in debt that they have to cut back their own spending programmes. So small and growing businesses will be our most important job creators. And I want us to look at all the reasons why people find it so hard to start a business and all the barriers that stop a small business growing and really get tough with ourselves in addressing them. I want us to create a new economic dynamism in our country. I want to see more bank lending, particularly for small businesses. More deregulation. More investment in the sectors of the future - like with our reform of the electricity markets which will help to create tens of thousands of new sustainable green jobs. From the start of the year right through to the Budget and beyond, we are resolved to be relentlessly focused on supporting growth and driving job creation across our economy. Second, aspiration. In spite of some good measures in recent years - Sure Start and the Academy programme for instance - social mobility in Britain has stalled. Bright children from poor backgrounds do much better in other countries than they do here in the UK. That shames us. It’s in the very earliest years of a child’s life that disadvantage really takes hold. That’s why we are protecting schools spending and enhancing it for the least well-off, offering free nursery education for disadvantaged two-year-olds and introducing a pupil premium, worth hundreds of pounds for each disadvantaged pupil. But unless we modernise our public services, like education, we will never build a country of real opportunity. Nor will we ever sustainably live within our means with outdated public services, pensions and welfare. So our third priority must be to modernize those public services. We will shift power away from central bureaucracy and give choice to the parents, patients and local citizens who use public services. This will mean more open public services, more innovative, more responsive to what people want, and better value for money. Fourth and finally, I want to say something about our national security. For many years now we have been aware of the threat we face from international terrorism. Recent arrests show that that threat is still very much with us. And it is as serious today as it ever has been. As we enter the New Year our police officers, together with their colleagues in the security and intelligence agencies, are working around the clock to foil plots that would do terrible harm to our people and our economy. This government will be unstinting in the support it gives them. But they also depend on the support of the public as they go about their work: together we will defend our values and way of life and defeat those who threaten them. But we must ask ourselves as a country how we are allowing the radicalisation and poisoning of the minds of some young British Muslims who then contemplate and sometimes carry out acts of sickening barbarity. And the overwhelming majority of British Muslims who detest this extremism must help us to find the answers together. But in the fight against terrorism we cannot just protect ourselves at home. We also need to take action with our international partners abroad. Just before Christmas, the Prince of Wales and I visited service personnel being treated at the Royal Centre for Defence Medicine in Birmingham. It was a stark reminder of the incredible bravery and sacrifice being made by all our servicemen and women who put their lives on the line to keep us safe. For those serving in Afghanistan, 2011 is a crucial year in which we will start to transfer security responsibility for districts and provinces to Afghan control. As the Afghans become steadily more capable of looking after their own security, so we will be able to start to bring our own forces home. Enterprise, aspiration, public service reform and national security: these are the things that will determine whether in 2011 we take the steps towards the better, stronger, safer Britain that is within our grasp. I am determined that we will. That together, we have the right plan to pull through the tough times ahead. And that if 2010 was the year we stopped the rot, we can make 2011 the year that Britain gets back on her feet.",Prime Minister,David Cameron,https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/new-year-podcast,,DEVELOPMENT
Russia,30-09-2003,Vladimir Putin,Opening Address at a Meeting of the Security Council on National Border Policy," Esteemed colleagues,

On our agenda there is a series of questions connected with implementing state border policies. We have already examined these questions at a special meeting of the Security Council in November 2000.

Today we will evaluate what we have been able to do in this time, and determine priorities for the future.

I want to stress: the main goal of border policies in Russia is effective national security. At the same time, these policies should assist the integration of our country into the international community, and the development of friendly relations with our neighbours. And of course, to correspond fully to modern approaches to rights and freedoms of citizens.

I would like to note that in recent years serious steps have been taken to increase the level of border security in Russia. The necessary structural changes have been made in the system of border bodies. Primarily, in transferring functions of state border protection to the Federal Security Service.

This decision was designed to optimize administration, more effective coordination of the actions of power bodies and to strengthen the operational component in the activity of border bodies.

Positive progress, even if not very large, has been noted in the system of letting goods and cargo through border points.

Together with Kazakhstan colleagues, we are properly organizing the Russian-Kazakhstan border.

I would also like to mention the Conception of Border Cooperation passed by Parliament. This document stipulates the active development of economic and humanitarian ties with our neighbours. It opens new possibilities for business activity in border regions.

Furthermore, in March this year the Conception of regulating immigration processes was passed, and the program of action for fulfilling it was confirmed. All these things are important steps in forming a modern normative legal base. A base that will make it possible to reach a civilized solution of immigration problems, and also to give a fundamentally new appearance to the border.

At the same time, attention should be given to the following fundamental aspects.

First, it is the actual strategy of guarding and protecting the state border.

The main approach here is to reduce the military component and move to an efficient military method of protecting our border with maximum use of modern technical capabilities. It is clear that the main threats on the Russian border today are trans-border crime, illegal drug traffic and illegal immigration. And to combat these essentially non-military threats, it is not necessary to maintain superfluous military units.

Of course, this does not mean, and cannot mean, abandoning the military component. In those areas where there is a real danger of terrorist infiltration, it even needs to be increased.

On the whole, we need a differentiated formation of border groupings – depending on the situation in specific areas of the border and the nature of probable threats to the country’s security.

Second, the task of organizing the border according to modern requirements remains relevant. And, above all, providing it with new technical equipment.

Here I count on active work by the recently created State border commission headed by Mikhail Kasyanov. Furthermore, the Government needs to speed up work on the special federal programme to organize the border. Of course, without any damage to the quality of the document.

And most importantly, behind the formula “the development of border infrastructure” we should above all see people – those who protect our borders, and those who live on the border.

I am not even talking about people who visit our country and judge Russia to a significant degree by how they are met and seen off at the border.

I believe that it we also need to use our capabilities more actively in international and regional unions and organizations, above all in the Commonwealth of Independent States, the Eurasian Economic Community and the Collective Security Treaty Organisation. The success of organizing borders depends in many ways on our joint work.

Third, there is the foreign policy aspects of border policies.

For over 10 years we have been working on delimitation and international legal registration of the Russian border. For a final decision on problems in this sphere, the Internal Ministry and law-enforcement departments must increase the discussion process and hold constructive talks, firmly upholding our national interests.

And last of all. Practice shows that the activity of border structures is impossible without support from power bodies of border regions. And I would like to appeal to the heads of subjects of the Federation, and also to Presidential representatives, to pay serious, heightened attention to these issues. For many regions, border policies are a new factor. They only became border regions recently, but this is very important area.

In the draft resolution for today’s meeting, we have determined the main areas of work to improve the system of border security. I propose to begin discussion of them.",President,Vladimir Putin,http://en.kremlin.ru/events/president/transcripts/statements/22136,,DEVELOPMENT
China,11-10-2013 00:00,Li Keqiang,Hand-in-Hand Toward a Better Future,"Thailand, a beautiful and fascinating country, is known to the world for its captivating landscape, abundant resources and splendid culture. The Thai people lead a life of prosperity. I am coming to Thailand again soon, long after my last trip here, to pay an official visit to this friendly neighbor of China. I wish to convey the warm greetings and best wishes of the Chinese people to our friends in Thailand. I am full of expectations for this visit, and I sincerely hope that the visit will give a strong boost to the traditional China-Thailand friendship and start another brilliant chapter of amity and cooperation between our two countries in a new era.

China and Thailand have been good brothers since ancient times. Back in the Yuan Dynasty, King Ramkhamhaeng the Great invited hundreds of Chinese craftsmen to teach ceramic techniques in Sukhothai and Phitsanulok. By working together, the Chinese and local craftsmen created the exquisite and unique Sangkhalok porcelain, whose beauty has been well-preserved till this day. In the Ming Dynasty, the Ayutthaya Kingdom sent more than 100 delegations to China. Its students even studied at China's Imperial College. Chinese and Thai scholars jointly compiled the early version of the Chinese-Thai dictionary entitled Translations of Siamese. The original copy of the dictionary is still kept at a library in Beijing. On his voyages to the western seas, Chinese navigator Zheng He led his ships northwards along the Chao Phraya River and reached today's Phra Nakhon Si Ayutthaya Province. He brought along to the local people Chinese calendar and measuring and weighing instruments as well as agricultural techniques such as the production of solar salt, well-digging and terracing. And he took back home the spices, pepper, paddy rice and fine fruit tree seeds of Thailand. Through those long centuries of exchanges a deep friendship was formed. The ever-growing mutual understanding and goodwill between the two peoples has laid a solid foundation for the sound and steady growth of China-Thailand relations.

Since the establishment of diplomatic relations, the people of China and Thailand have worked closely together and supported each other in times of adversity. Together we tackled the Asian financial crisis and the international financial crisis, upholding economic stability in both our countries and the region at large. Together we fought against the SARS epidemic and bird flu, protecting the health of people of both countries. Together we prevailed over the Indian Ocean tsunamis, earthquakes in China, severe floods in Thailand and other natural disasters, allowing life and work to quickly return to normal in disaster-hit areas.

A storm will be followed by a rainbow. Our bilateral cooperation has expanded rapidly and produced fruitful results across the board. China has become Thailand's biggest source of tourists and export market. Thailand is China's largest source of natural rubber. Among Southeast Asian countries, Thailand is the first to conduct strategic cooperation with China, the first to implement zero-tariff arrangement on vegetables and fruits within the framework of China-ASEAN FTA, the first to complete a China Culture Center and the first to receive a pair of giant pandas for collaborative scientific research. In fact, the pandas living in Chiang Mai have even got a baby panda now named Lin Bing. Thailand is on track to becoming the country with the largest number of consulates general in China.

Since the turn of the century, China-Thailand relations have entered a fast-track of sound growth. A comprehensive strategic cooperative partnership has been established, and there are tremendous opportunities and room for the expansion of cooperation in various fields.

We share the same development goals. As two important developing countries in the region, both China and Thailand give top priority to development and both are working to achieve economic prosperity and national development and improve people's well-being. Amid complicated and profound changes in the international situation, Asia's status and role in the world are becoming increasingly prominent. For China and Thailand, nothing is more important than national development and revival. Our destinies are closely linked and our interests intertwined. To support and work with each other for common progress is a wish shared by both countries, which serves the fundamental interests of our two peoples.

We have vast opportunities for cooperation. Thailand is an important ASEAN member, ranking second, third and fourth among ASEAN countries in terms of economic size, total area and population. Thailand is implementing its 11th National Economic and Social Development Plan, advancing infrastructural development, and further improving people's living standards. China, for its part, is in the process of implementing its 12th Five-Year Plan towards the goal of doubling its 2010 GDP and per capita income by 2020 and completing the building of a moderately prosperous society in all respects. China's development will unleash even greater market demand. This represents important cooperation opportunities and huge cooperation space for Thailand and other ASEAN countries.

Thailand is a leading producer of rice and other agricultural products. China will support its companies in importing one million tons of Thai rice in the next five years as well as more specialty produce from Thailand. Rail cooperation will become a new highlight in our bilateral cooperation. China has gained rich experience and credentials in high-speed railway construction. We are ready to take an active part in high-speed rail development in Thailand, as this will facilitate the movement of goods and personnel in the region and enhance Thailand's role as a regional transport hub. China and Thailand will vigorously carry out cooperation in electricity, power grid, water conservancy and renewable energy. As our economic and personnel exchanges get closer, China will seriously consider the establishment of an RMB clearing bank in Thailand to create conditions for Chinese and Thai companies to increase cross-border RMB trade settlement.

Our two countries share a solid cultural and people-to-people bond. In 2012, there were nearly three million mutual visits between the mainland of China and Thailand. And the number has risen dramatically since the start of this year. Chinese has become a popular second foreign language among Thai friends while Thai cuisine, TV series and sports are winning the hearts of more people in China. Jointly sponsored activities like the Two Lands One Heart gala and the Happy Chinese Spring Festival in Bangkok have flourished over the years and become bridges for heart-to-heart communication between our two peoples.

We are full of confidence in the future growth of China-Thailand relations. We hope that China-Thailand friendship will keep surging forward like the Yangtze River and the Chao Phraya River. Let us join hands and embrace a brighter future.",State Councilor and Foreign Minister of the People's Republic of China,Xi Jinping,https://www.fmprc.gov.cn/mfa_eng/wjdt_665385/zyjh_665391/t1087832.shtml,,INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS
Russia,11-08-2000 00:00,Vladimir Putin,Address at a Meeting with Regional Leaders in the Southern Federal District,"Good afternoon.

The Southern District is of special significance for Russia both economically and geopolitically. It is an area with a high concentration of regions and a high population density. Dozens of different ethnicities live here.

We have discussed this matter at a public meeting just now. We started the discussion with that. There are still lingering inter-ethnic conflicts. Trans-national conflicts have become a tool in the hands of political adventurers. The use of ethnic and confessional differences is raising a wall of mistrust and a rift between people, and creates a breeding ground for new conflicts. And, in the final analysis, threatens the security of the population and the integrity of the Russian state.

It can be said that by now the nagging old problems have been by and large smoothed away through concerted efforts. But we are still far off from resting on our laurels and believing that there are no problems left.

A difficult social situation persists in the district. The average standards of living there are worse than elsewhere in the Russian Federation. Unemployment has reached threatening levels, being twice as high as across the country. In Ingushetia, for example, it is more than 40%, and in North Ossetia, 36%. More than half the population has incomes below the living wage.

I only mentioned these generally familiar problems to stress once again that the region has always called and will always call not only for close attention, but also for a special approach.

The federal authorities have for years lacked a coherent and consistent policy towards the North Caucasus. Many questions have been shelved for decades. We ought to destroy the deep-rooted idea that the Russian Caucasus is a conflict-ridden territory.

<…>

I want to highlight particularly the special federal programme for the socio-economic development of the Southern Federal District … We must realise that the district’s problems will never go away if we consider a separate programme for every problem, or for every region of the Federation, if we view each region as an isolated case. Perhaps that was the main weakness of many programmes adopted for individual regions …

…Clearly, the situation needs changing drastically. The Government is elaborating new approaches to preparing special federal programmes. Their number is set to be radically reduced, and they must be made absolutely realistic …

The programme is targeted, above all, at key problems of strategic importance in the region and in Russia, issues concerned with the region’s geo-political situation and the need to safeguard Russia’s national interests. The most urgent ones are to expand transport corridors, build an infrastructure for exporting oil and gas through the North Caucasus, and a number of others. The development of spa resorts is also among them. Their distinctive advantages are not being used to the full. These considerations make the problem a state issue.

<…>

We should give serious thought to attracting more Russian and overseas investors to the region. I repeat: we must break the established stereotype about the North Caucasus as an unstable territory.

The implementation of the programme must become the concern not only of federal authorities, but also of regional and local administrations. This is why we must all focus on drafting and implementing these programmes.

We must likewise give thought to creating new jobs. An economic revival, which would inevitably lead to new jobs, is one of the ways of improving the migration situation.

For the time being, our migration policy is poorly tied up with the labour market, employment, and future prospects of the region. If anything, we have not had a migration policy yet in which all these factors are taken into account at the same time. An effective migration policy is possible only in a country with precisely drawn borders controlled by this state. And if we have nothing of the kind in the traditional sense of the word, how can we pursue a migration policy? Everything else is a lot of hot air.

In the Southern District, the migration issue poses one of the biggest challenges. It calls for urgent measures to map out strategic areas of work. The Presidential Envoy must take the most active part in it.

Migration, if competently addressed, can make a good instrument of economic growth. At today’s meeting with intellectuals we spoke of effective ways in which some industrialised countries use their migration flows. But they act purposefully. Just try and move to any other country. We have a different situation, because our migrants or immigrants were residents and citizens of a state that was one whole only recently.

But Russia’s migration policy is very liberal. It grants its citizenship, even dual citizenship, to whoever wants to obtain it. There must, however, be clear priorities in this field. And they must, of course, stipulate certain financial commitments. That is to say, we should invest financial resources where we want to have a socio-economic and political effect.

In our country it is still difficult to tell the difference between legal and illegal migration. We do not have a border in its own right. But we have to think this through in advance, because the border is bound to come. Some progress has already been made. Therefore, now is the time to start formulating these principles. We must know what we want to do and what to achieve.

In 1988, CIS countries adopted an agreement on cooperation in fighting the so-called unlawful migration; more momentum and impetus need to be given to it now. Many people have left the Chechen Republic. To provide accommodation and jobs for them is the district’s top priority.

While on the subject, I want to stress once again: reconstruction efforts in Chechnya must be stepped up. In previous years considerable government funds have been sunk into the work without any effect and we still do not know where they have gone: this negative experience must be a lesson to us. But this does not mean that we should sit idle and do nothing. We must rebuild Chechnya, rebuild its housing, rebuild its economy. If we fail in this, we will fail in our primary function as a state – looking after the people.

Now, about so-called refugees and tent camps. We must create favourable economic conditions, so that people will stop clinging to these camps. We know why they stay there. Even if they have housing in Chechnya, there is no food and no jobs there. And while things continue the way they are, refugees, even though they may have homes – let alone those who have lost them – will sit it out in tents all the same …

…There must be absolute transparency and accountability in financing the reconstruction effort. There must also be control over the stipulated use of the allocated funds. History must not repeat itself, nor must the funds disappear into the thin air.

At today’s meeting we will also touch upon lawmaking. I wish to emphasise that a unified legislative space, effective vertical power structures, and strictly defined briefs for executives at all levels are the bedrock of federative relations. Only this way will lead to order in the country.

There must be a single approach, common requirements and a high sense of responsibility across the board. Prosecutors in the regions that make up the Southern District have already challenged about 300 laws and other legislative acts as running counter to federal laws. That, of course, exemplifies wildcat legislating practices that were rampant not only in this district but also across the country.

Here I would like to reiterate my view which I have expressed elsewhere time and again: I agree with many regional governors that federal laws often fail to take local features into account. Therefore I urge all regional leaders to make more energetic and persistent use of the right to initiate legislation. And I think it would be right for the federal centre to support such initiatives. It would be right if we lobby the State Duma together to pass the so-called omnibus legislative principles in some fields, which could help to better regulate public relations locally, because local lawmakers know ethnic and local features better.

But I wish to call your attention to the fact that so long as any of the laws are in effect and we have not changed them, they must be fully enforced throughout all Russia. This is the point I particularly want to make to persecutors of all levels and the District Deputy Prosecutor-General.

Thank you for your attention.",President,Vladimir Putin,http://en.kremlin.ru/events/president/transcripts/statements/21129,,DEVELOPMENT
USA,08-01-2020 00:00,Donald Trump,Remarks by President Trump on Iran,"THE PRESIDENT:  As long as I am President of the United States, Iran will never be allowed to have a nuclear weapon.

Good morning.  I’m pleased to inform you: The American people should be extremely grateful and happy no Americans were harmed in last night’s attack by the Iranian regime.  We suffered no casualties, all of our soldiers are safe, and only minimal damage was sustained at our military bases.

Our great American forces are prepared for anything.  Iran appears to be standing down, which is a good thing for all parties concerned and a very good thing for the world.

No American or Iraqi lives were lost because of the precautions taken, the dispersal of forces, and an early warning system that worked very well.  I salute the incredible skill and courage of America’s men and women in uniform.

For far too long — all the way back to 1979, to be exact — nations have tolerated Iran’s destructive and destabilizing behavior in the Middle East and beyond.  Those days are over.  Iran has been the leading sponsor of terrorism, and their pursuit of nuclear weapons threatens the civilized world.  We will never let that happen.

Last week, we took decisive action to stop a ruthless terrorist from threatening American lives.  At my direction, the United States military eliminated the world’s top terrorist, Qasem Soleimani.  As the head of the Quds Force, Soleimani was personally responsible for some of the absolutely worst atrocities.

He trained terrorist armies, including Hezbollah, launching terrorist strikes against civilian targets.  He fueled bloody civil wars all across the region.  He viciously wounded and murdered thousands of U.S. troops, including the planting of roadside bombs that maim and dismember their victims.

Soleimani directed the recent attacks on U.S. personnel in Iraq that badly wounded four service members and killed one American, and he orchestrated the violent assault on the U.S. embassy in Baghdad.  In recent days, he was planning new attacks on American targets, but we stopped him.

Soleimani’s hands were drenched in both American and Iranian blood.  He should have been terminated long ago.  By removing Soleimani, we have sent a powerful message to terrorists: If you value your own life, you will not threaten the lives of our people.

As we continue to evaluate options in response to Iranian aggression, the United States will immediately impose additional punishing economic sanctions on the Iranian regime.  These powerful sanctions will remain until Iran changes its behavior.

In recent months alone, Iran has seized ships in international waters, fired an unprovoked strike on Saudi Arabia, and shot down two U.S. drones.

Iran’s hostilities substantially increased after the foolish Iran nuclear deal was signed in 2013, and they were given $150 billion, not to mention $1.8 billion in cash.  Instead of saying “thank you” to the United States, they chanted “death to America.”  In fact, they chanted “death to America” the day the agreement was signed.

Then, Iran went on a terror spree, funded by the money from the deal, and created hell in Yemen, Syria, Lebanon, Afghanistan, and Iraq.  The missiles fired last night at us and our allies were paid for with the funds made available by the last administration.  The regime also greatly tightened the reins on their own country, even recently killing 1,500 people at the many protests that are taking place all throughout Iran.

The very defective JCPOA expires shortly anyway, and gives Iran a clear and quick path to nuclear breakout.  Iran must abandon its nuclear ambitions and end its support for terrorism.  The time has come for the United Kingdom, Germany, France, Russia, and China to recognize this reality.

They must now break away from the remnants of the Iran deal -– or JCPOA –- and we must all work together toward making a deal with Iran that makes the world a safer and more peaceful place.  We must also make a deal that allows Iran to thrive and prosper, and take advantage of its enormous untapped potential.  Iran can be a great country.

Peace and stability cannot prevail in the Middle East as long as Iran continues to foment violence, unrest, hatred, and war.  The civilized world must send a clear and unified message to the Iranian regime: Your campaign of terror, murder, mayhem will not be tolerated any longer.  It will not be allowed to go forward.

Today, I am going to ask NATO to become much more involved in the Middle East process.  Over the last three years, under my leadership, our economy is stronger than ever before and America has achieved energy independence.  These historic accompliments [accomplishments] changed our strategic priorities.  These are accomplishments that nobody thought were possible.  And options in the Middle East became available.  We are now the number-one producer of oil and natural gas anywhere in the world.  We are independent, and we do not need Middle East oil.

The American military has been completely rebuilt under my administration, at a cost of $2.5 trillion.  U.S. Armed Forces are stronger than ever before.  Our missiles are big, powerful, accurate, lethal, and fast.  Under construction are many hypersonic missiles.

The fact that we have this great military and equipment, however, does not mean we have to use it.  We do not want to use it.  American strength, both military and economic, is the best deterrent.

Three months ago, after destroying 100 percent of ISIS and its territorial caliphate, we killed the savage leader of ISIS, al-Baghdadi, who was responsible for so much death, including the mass beheadings of Christians, Muslims, and all who stood in his way.  He was a monster.  Al-Baghdadi was trying again to rebuild the ISIS caliphate, and failed.

Tens of thousands of ISIS fighters have been killed or captured during my administration.  ISIS is a natural enemy of Iran.  The destruction of ISIS is good for Iran, and we should work together on this and other shared priorities.

Finally, to the people and leaders of Iran: We want you to have a future and a great future — one that you deserve, one of prosperity at home, and harmony with the nations of the world.  The United States is ready to embrace peace with all who seek it.

I want to thank you, and God bless America.  Thank you very much.  Thank you.  Thank you.",President,Donald Trump,https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefings-statements/remarks-president-trump-iran/,,EXTREMISM

China,21-06-2017 00:00,H.E. Wang Yi,Work Together to Fight Poverty and Achieve Common Prosperity,"Your Excellency Moussa Faki Mahamat, Chairperson of the African Union Commission,
Distinguished Experts,
Friends from the Media,
Ladies and Gentlemen,

It gives me great pleasure to be here at the African Union (AU) Conference Center, a symbol of China-Africa friendship, and attend the opening ceremony of the China-Africa High-Level Dialogue and Think Tank Forum on Fighting Against Poverty for Common Prosperity. On behalf of the Chinese side, I would like to offer our congratulations on the successful opening of the forum, extend our thanks to the AU Commission for its thoughtful arrangements and welcome all of you to today's event.

This is my 12th visit to Africa since I became China's foreign minister. My job has taken me to 31 African countries and allowed me to see first hand the progress in Africa's development and the robust China-Africa cooperation and personally experience the deep-rooted friendship between China and Africa. China always believes that the 21st century belongs as much to Asia as to Africa and all the developing countries.

The world today is seeing greater uncertainties and destabilizing factors. Peace and development are far from being achieved in many parts of the world. Close to 400 million people in Africa live under the poverty line, and more than 40 million Chinese need to be lifted out of poverty. China and Africa need to join hands in fighting poverty and achieving common development. This is our responsibility to the future generations, the shared objective of Chinese and African people and the inherent part of human progress.

Over the past 40 years, under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, the Chinese government and people have committed themselves to reform and opening up and embarked on a successful path of development. China has lifted over 700 million Chinese out of poverty and contributed 70% to the UN Millennium Development Goal on poverty reduction, creating a miracle in the world development history. President Xi Jinping has now proposed to build a community of shared future for mankind, where we will strive for a better life not just for the Chinese people but also those around the world, especially in developing countries.

As a Chinese saying goes, ""A single flower does not make spring; One hundred flowers in full blossom bring spring to the garden"". As stressed by President Xi, China's relations with Africa must be built on the principles of sincerity, practical results, affinity and good faith and the values of friendship, justice and shared interests. In other words, we need to take into full account of Africa's needs and synergize China's development with that of Africa to realize common development and prosperity. Today, Chairman Moussa Faki and I want to join the think tanks, experts and media representatives from China and Africa to share development experience, discuss cooperation ideas, pool wisdom for Africa's poverty reduction and development and plan China-Africa mutually beneficial cooperation. I look forward to your deep insights and practical recommendations that are suited to Africa's realities.

Ladies and Gentlemen,
Friends,

The book, Up and Out of Poverty, records the thinking and actions of President Xi in the area of poverty reduction when he worked in Ningde, Fujian Province. While the local per capita GDP was just US$198 when he first started out as Ningde's party secretary in 1988, it exceeded US$8,000 last year. The book tells the success story of how the once poverty-stricken city got itself out of poverty and embarked on development by leveraging its own advantages and with the help of sound policy-making. The thoughts, ideas and policies laid out in the book were not only key to Ningde's success in poverty reduction and development, but were also an epitome of the whole country's successful experience in reform and opening-up. Let me quote a few lines from the book: ""Poverty alleviation requires a change of attitude and the support of education""; ""developing the economy is our political priority""; and ""the weak hatchling bird can be the first to take flight"". The book also emphasized tailoring policies to local conditions, action-taking and giving ""equal importance to growing the economy and keeping the government clean"". Today, they continue to guide China in meeting its poverty reduction targets and are highly relevant for other developing countries in their poverty reduction efforts.

In light of the interest of African leaders, the book was translated into English and French and published at the end of last year. Both of the two books, Xi Jinping: The Governance of China and Up and Out of Poverty, have been well received in many countries. I believe they will be really helpful to our African friends present here today.

Ladies and Gentlemen,

The CPC Central Committee with Comrade Xi Jinping at its core has made the solemn commitment to build China into a moderately prosperous society in all respects by 2020 when the CPC celebrates its centenary, and eliminating poverty across the country is one of the important preconditions. We are fully confident in delivering on this goal. Both Ningde's encouraging story and the nationwide progress against poverty show that the following four principles are particularly important.

First, fully leverage one's own strengths. As a major developing country with over 1.3 billion people, China has no precedent to follow in poverty alleviation and development. What we have been pursuing is to give full play to the political and institutional advantages of the CPC leadership and the socialist system with Chinese characteristics, and learn from but not mechanically copy other's experience. As such, we have gradually embarked on a successful path of reducing poverty through development with distinct Chinese features.

Second, take development as the central task. Development is the ""master key"" to solving all problems. The CPC and governments at all levels have taken the economy as the central task, made development the top priority in governance, concentrated all efforts on it and rallied the whole nation in this endeavor. Consequently, China has become the world's second largest economy in just a few decades. And a solid material foundation is laid for poverty alleviation.

Third, design tailor-made policies based on local conditions. When in Ningde, President Xi made many fact-finding trips to explore its advantages and decided to develop agriculture based on local strengths and the processing and manufacturing industry as the two economic pillars, which proved to be the right formula that took Ningde out of poverty. As China is such a big country with diverse strengths by regions, we encourage tailor-made development plans and take targeted approach to roll back poverty, which has uplifted the overall development of the country.

Fourth, pursue opening-up and cooperation. While remain committed to opening up, China has actively adapted itself to globalization, seized the historic opportunities in the global adjustment and shift of industries and actively participated in various forms of international cooperation. We continue to update our development concepts, strengthen laws and regulations and introduce policy incentives. All these have made China a popular investment destination with sustained fast economic growth, and also led to remarkable advances in China's poverty reduction cause.

Ladies and Gentlemen,
Friends,

China and Africa are now facing historic opportunities of cooperation. The Johannesburg Summit of the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation (FOCAC) held in December 2015 was a big success and ushered in a new era of China-Africa cooperation for win-win outcomes and common development. President Xi announced at the summit that China and Africa will focus on implementing ""ten cooperation plans"" in the next three years, including one on poverty reduction and development, which echo the urgent needs of African countries. At the Belt and Road Forum for International Cooperation successfully held last month in Beijing, President Xi highlighted the Silk Road spirit of peace and cooperation, openness and inclusiveness, mutual learning and mutual benefit, with a view to realizing common development and prosperity and building a community of shared future for mankind. This ambitious vision has lent fresh impetus to and opened up new vista for China-Africa cooperation.

China and Africa have always been a community of shared interests and future. We stand ready to seize the opportunities presented by the Belt and Road Initiative, synergize the ""ten cooperation plans"" with the Agenda 2063 and deepen mutually beneficial cooperation, to support African countries in achieving independent and sustainable development and eliminating poverty at an early date.

First, China will step up the sharing of governance experience with Africa, formulate sound plans, identify respective strengths and future cooperation priorities, and jointly explore a pathway out of poverty and toward development as needed by African countries. While we will share our experience with African friends without any reservation, we will never impose our own will on anyone.

Second, China will work with Africa to link up development strategies, pursue efficient and high quality development, and focus on projects with solid economic and social returns, as effective ways to tackle the three bottlenecks of underdeveloped infrastructure, inadequate human capital and lack of financial resources on a priority basis and create favorable conditions for poverty reduction and development. It is also important to avoid ill-considered investment and financing which might expose Africa to debt risks and financial burden, and keep Africa's anti-poverty cause on a sustainable path.

Third, China will contribute to an enabling environment for Africa to fight poverty. Stability is the prerequisite for poverty reduction and development. We will actively support African countries' capacity building in national defense, peacekeeping, law and order and counter-terrorism to address African issues by themselves, and help Africa concentrate on poverty reduction in a stable environment and improve employment, subsistence and health in particular, which are the three critical aspects of people's livelihood.

Fourth, China will actively encourage the international community to support Africa in scaling up efforts against poverty. We welcome diversified partnerships for Africa and call on all parties to reject the outdated mentality of zero-sum game and embrace the new thinking of win-win cooperation. Developed countries, in particular, should further increase their attention and input to Africa's poverty reduction cause, truly honor their commitment, and jointly help Africa achieve durable peace, development and prosperity.

Ladies and Gentlemen,
Friends,

Both China and Africa are standing at a new starting point for development and rejuvenation. We have the confidence, capability and wisdom to strengthen solidarity and cooperation to fight against poverty, strive for common prosperity, and jointly embrace a brighter future.

To conclude, let me once again wish this event a great success. ",State Councilor and Foreign Minister of the People's Republic of China,Xi Jinping,https://www.fmprc.gov.cn/mfa_eng/wjdt_665385/zyjh_665391/t1472200.shtml,,INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS
Russia,25-09-2009,Dmitry Medvedev,Statement by President of Russia Dmitry Medvedev regarding the situation in Iran,"I would like to say a word about regional issues, particularly the problems related to Iran. As we stated two days ago in New York, we are united in our determination to begin talks on signing an all-encompassing, long-term agreement intended to settle the nuclear issues in Iran as soon as possible.

That said, today’s situation requires particular attention. In their recent letter to the IAEA, Iranian authorities admitted that they are building a new uranium enrichment plant. The fact that Iran has been constructing this enrichment plant over the course of several years without IAEA’s knowledge is a cause of great concern.

The construction of a new uranium enrichment plant contradicts the UN Security Council’s repeated demands for Iran to halt its enrichment activities.

The Russian Side, along with its other partners, feels that the IAEA must immediately examine the situation in the context of the inspections being carried out over Iran’s nuclear programme. As part of the obligations that Russia has taken upon itself as an IAEA member, we will assist in this audit through any means we have available. We are calling on Iran to fully cooperate with the Agency as it conducts this investigation.

Russia remains committed to serious dialogue with Iran, with the goal of reaching an agreement on effective measures to alleviate the international community’s concerns regarding Iran’s nuclear programme. Indeed, the evidence that has surfaced, which shows that Iran is building a new enrichment plant, only increases our determination to quickly attain concrete, verifiable results.

On October 1, 2009, we are planning a meeting of the so-called Group of Six – of which Russia is a member – together with representatives from Iran. This meeting will give Iran the opportunity to demonstrate that it also intends to seek out a negotiated solution to this problem. This will be possible if Iran arrives at the meeting in Geneva ready to focus on the nuclear issue, take practical steps toward rebuilding trust toward its nuclear programme and ensuring its transparency, and demonstrate its willingness to fully cooperate with the IAEA. In light of the newly-revealed evidence that Iran is building a new enrichment plant, we are counting on Iran to present convincing evidence of its intent to develop nuclear energy strictly for peaceful purposes.",President,Dmitry Medvedev,http://en.kremlin.ru/events/president/transcripts/statements/48467,,INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS

Distinguished Guests,
Dear Friends,

I am pleased to be invited to the Global Town Hall today and join you in this important discussion on ""Rebuilding from the COVID-19 World"".

The outgoing year of 2020 will make its mark in human history. The sudden onslaught of COVID-19 shocked the world in every possible way. In less than a year, international travel has virtually come to a halt. Trade has notably contracted. Global economy is mired in a deep recession. And political and social turbulence has exacerbated in some countries. The impact of COVID-19, compounded with major changes unseen in a century, has brought the international situation to a new watershed.

Yet it is by overcoming tribulations and crises one after another that humanity emerges stronger and makes greater progress. As President Xi Jinping stated at this year's UN General Assembly, the courage, resolve and compassion demonstrated by humanity in the face of this major disaster has lit the dark hour. The virus will be defeated, and humanity will win. To contain the raging virus and plan for the post-COVID world, countries need to draw experience and lessons from the disaster, build consensus and strength through collective response, and work together to usher in a better future for humanity.

We believe that countries need to fight for an early victory against COVID-19 through enhanced solidarity and cooperation. The coronavirus is still wreaking havoc worldwide. Some countries are seeing an even more ferocious resurgence than the earlier outbreaks. No one can stay immune from the crisis, and we are all in this together.

As one of the first countries to effectively contain the coronavirus, China will continue to leverage its strengths to advance international cooperation on epidemic response, and share its experience on containment and treatment with other countries. We will continue to provide support and assistance to countries and regions in need, and deliver our solemn commitment of making COVID-19 vaccines a global public good. We will continue to fully engage with the World Health Organization and other parties, and actively pursue a global community of health for all.

We believe that countries need to improve the global governance system through strengthened multilateral coordination. This once-in-a-century pandemic once again tells us that no country can solve its own problems through a beggar-thy-neighbor policy or zero-sum approach. And such practices offer no solution to global challenges either. Multilateral governance may not be perfect, but it provides the basic framework for tackling global challenges. Multilateralism may have been challenged, but it remains the basic guarantee for countries to survive and thrive.

As a responsible major country, China will continue to advocate and practice multilateralism, firmly uphold the UN-centered international system, and firmly defend the basic norms governing international relations underpinned by the UN Charter. Meanwhile, under the principle of extensive consultation, joint contribution and shared benefits, we will continue to work with all countries to promote necessary reform and improvement of the global governance system, so that it can balance equity and efficiency more properly, respond to global challenges more quickly and effectively, and better reflect the justified and legitimate demands of emerging markets and developing countries. All this will make the global governance system more equitable, reasonable, inclusive and beneficial for all.

We believe that countries need to promote global economic recovery through greater openness and integration. What has happened shows that COVID-19 cannot and will not stop the prevailing trend toward economic globalization or regional integration. Seeking ""decoupling"" or ""erecting walls"" is self-destructive in the long run. Retreating to isolationism and protectionism is anachronistic. The Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP), formally signed a few days ago, marked the establishment of the world's largest free trade area. With concrete actions, participating countries have sent a clear message of their shared commitment to openness and cooperation.

As a major economy in the world, while keeping COVID-19 response measures in place, China will continue to work with other countries to improve ""fast tracks"" and ""green lanes"" for the movement of people and goods, and keep the global supply chain stable. China will stay committed to the win-win strategy of opening-up, and build a new and open economic system of higher standard. It will strengthen mutually beneficial cooperation with other countries bilaterally and under multilateral mechanisms, advance high-quality Belt and Road cooperation, and contribute its share to the early recovery of the global economy.

We believe that countries need to safeguard peace and development in their regions through enhanced dialogue and mutual trust. East Asia, our shared home, is the most vibrant region in the world with the biggest development potential. The hard-won peace and stability of East Asia should not be taken for granted. Attempts to create division and confrontation and to form exclusive geopolitical blocs in the region would give rise to great security risks.

As a responsible country in East Asia, China will remain guided by its neighborhood policy of amity, sincerity, mutual benefit and inclusiveness. In promoting cooperation, China will continue to advocate the spirit of mutual respect, the principle of openness and inclusiveness, and a development-centered approach. It will firmly support ASEAN centrality, and stay committed to properly handling disputes with countries concerned through dialogue and consultation. It stands ready to work with ASEAN countries to safeguard regional peace and stability, and work with the whole international community to build a post-COVID world that enjoys lasting peace, prosperity, stability, and fairness and justice.

Friends,

Winter is always followed by Spring, and dark night will be brightened up by the light of dawn. We are confident that if all countries truly come together and forge ahead side by side, our world will emerge from the pandemic more prosperous, and that humanity will embrace a better future.

In conclusion, I wish the Global Town Hall a full success! Thank you!",State Councilor and Foreign Minister of the People's Republic of China,Xi Jinping,https://www.fmprc.gov.cn/mfa_eng/wjdt_665385/zyjh_665391/t1834041.shtml,,INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS
United Kingdom,09-Sep-20,Boris Johnson,Prime Minister's statement on coronavirus (COVID-19): 9 September 2020," Good afternoon, Welcome back to Downing Street for an update on coronavirus as we enter autumn and approach winter. I will first hand over to Chris to take us through the latest data before I set out how we are responding to it. Thank you Chris. It is clear from that very powerful graphic that we must act. The most important thing every one of us must do is remember the basics. First, wash your hands, regularly and for 20 seconds. Don’t get back into old habits, it is so vital. Second, wear a face covering over your mouth and nose if you are in an enclosed space and in close contact with people you don’t normally meet. I know wearing a face covering feels odd to some people and I understand that. But face coverings do make it harder for the virus to spread – so please, wear one to protect others. Third, make space. Always stay 2 metres away from people you don’t live with – or 1 metre with extra precautions, like extra ventilation, screens, or face coverings. Fourth, if you have COVID symptoms, get a test and self-isolate. We are now processing 1.2 million tests a week. To date we have carried out 15.4 million antigen tests – that’s more than any other country in Europe, and more per head than other European countries like Germany and Spain. We are increasing our testing capacity further to meet rising demand. You can help by only booking a test if you have a fever, a new continuous cough, or you’ve lost your sense of taste or smell – if you don’t have those symptoms and haven’t been asked to book a test, please don’t. So those are the basics – hands, face, space – and get a test if you have COVID symptoms. Since the pandemic began, we have asked you to reduce your social contact and limit your interactions with friends and family. I know that, over time, the rules have become quite complicated and confusing. We have spoken to police officers about what they need for an effective enforcement regime and of course, listened to the feedback from you, the public. In response, we are simplifying and strengthening the rules – making them easier for you to understand and for the police to enforce. I should stress that if we are to beat the virus then everyone, at all times, should limit social contact as much as possible and minimise interactions with other households. It is safer to meet outdoors and you should keep your distance from anyone you don’t live with, even if they are close friends or family. So in England, from Monday, we are introducing the rule of 6. You must not meet socially in groups of more than 6 – and if you do, you will be breaking the law. This will apply in any setting, indoors or outdoors, at home or in the pub. The ban will be set out in law and it will be enforced by the police – anyone breaking the rules risks being dispersed, fined and possibly arrested. This single measure replaces both the existing ban on gatherings of more than 30 and the current guidance on allowing 2 households to meet indoors. Now you only need to remember the rule of 6. There will be some limited exemptions. For example, if a single household or support bubble is larger than 6, they can still gather. COVID Secure venues like places of worship, gyms, restaurants and hospitality venues can still hold more than 6 people in total. Within those venues however, there must not be individual groups larger than 6, and groups must not mix socially or form larger groups. Education and work settings are unaffected, COVID Secure weddings and funerals can go ahead, up to a limit of 30 people, and organised sport will still be able to proceed. As we have found on previous occasions, this rule of 6 will of course throw up difficult cases. For example, two whole households will no longer be able to meet if they would together exceed the limit of 6 people. I am sorry about that and I wish that we did not have to take this step. But, as your Prime Minister, I must do what is necessary to stop the spread of the virus and to save lives. We will of course keep the rule of 6 under constant review and only keep it in place as long as it’s necessary. I also want to see – and the public wants to see – stronger enforcement of the rules which are already in place. So I’ve have tasked the Cabinet with increasing enforcement and I would like to thank the police, as always, and other authorities for the work they are doing to keep us all safe. In future: Premises and venues where people meet socially will be legally required to request the contact details of a member of every party, record and retain these details for 21 days, and provide them to NHS Test & Trace without delay when required. We will support local authorities to make further and faster use of their powers to close venues that are breaking the rules and pose a risk to public health. Fines will be levied against hospitality venues that fail to ensure their premises remain COVID Secure. We will boost the enforcement capacity of local authorities by introducing COVID Secure Marshalls to help ensure social distancing in town and city centres, and by setting up a register of Environmental Health Officers that local authorities can draw upon for support. We will simplify the Passenger Locator Form needed for travelling to the UK, and take measures to ensure these are completed and checked before departure. Border Force will step up enforcement efforts at the border to ensure arrivals are complying with the quarantine rules. We will also restrict the opening hours of premises, initially in some local areas. At the present time we must also, I’m afraid, revise plans to pilot larger audiences in venues later this month and review our intention to return audiences to stadiums and conference centres from 1 October. That doesn’t mean we’re going to scrap the programme entirely it just means we are going to review and abridge it, and the Culture Secretary will say more shortly. Let me be clear – these measures are not a second national lockdown – the whole point of them is to avoid a second national lockdown. By bearing down on social contact and improving enforcement, we can keep schools and businesses open, in the knowledge they are COVID Secure. I have always said schools and colleges should only ever be shut again as a very, very last resort. As the Chief Medical Officer and Chief Scientific Adviser have said, the long term risks to children’s life chances of not going to school are significant and far greater than the health risks of going back to school. Indeed it’s been fantastic to see so many children back in school this term and I want, once again, to thank all our teachers, and to reassure parents and pupils that schools are safe. University terms will also begin soon. Opening universities is critical, again, for students’ life chances and, again, the health risks to individuals are low. Of course, many university students are in the age bracket where we have seen the infection rates rise recently as Chris was just explaining. My message to students is simple. Please, for the sake of your education and your parents’ and your grandparents’ health: wash your hands, cover your face, make space, and don’t socially gather in groups of more than 6, now and when term starts. Today the Department for Education is publishing updated guidance for universities on how they can operate in a COVID Secure way, including a clear request not to send students home in the event of an outbreak, so as to avoid spreading the virus across the country. I am very grateful to universities for their continued cooperation and planning for the return of students. The measures I have set out today will help us control the virus but won’t, on their own, be enough to allow a more significant return to normality. Patrick is going to set out in a moment where we are on vaccines and treatments in a moment, but we are not there yet and there are no guarantees. So over the summer, we have therefore been working up an alternative plan which could allow life to return closer to normality. And that plan is based on mass testing. Up to now, we have used testing primarily to identify people who are positive – so we can isolate them from the community and protect high risk groups. And that will continue to be our priority. We are working hard to increase our testing capacity to 500,000 tests a day by the end of October. But in future, in the near future, we want to start using testing to identify people who are negative – who don’t have coronavirus and who are not infectious - so we can allow them to behave in a more normal way, in the knowledge they cannot infect anyone else with the virus. And we think, we hope, we believe that new types of test which are simple, quick and scalable will become available. They use swabs or saliva and can turn round results in 90 or even 20 minutes. Crucially, it should be possible to deploy these tests on a far bigger scale than any country has yet achieved – literally millions of tests processed every single day. That level of testing would allow people to lead more normal lives, without the need for social distancing: Theatres and sports venues could test all audience members on the day and let in those with a negative result, all those who are not infectious. Workplaces could be opened up to all those who test negative that morning and allow them to behave in a way that was normal before COVID. Those isolating because they are a contact, or quarantining after travelling abroad, could after a period be tested and released. Now that is an ambitious agenda, but we are going to pilot this approach in Salford from next month, with audiences in indoor and outdoor venues. And then we hope to go nationwide. There are a number of challenges. We need the technology to work. We need to source the necessary materials to manufacture so many tests. We need to put in place an efficient distribution network. And we need to work through the numerous logistical challenges. And as I say, we are not there yet, and I should repeat that, as we manage this period of high demand, it is especially important that if individuals don’t have symptoms, and have not been specifically advised to take a test, they should not be coming forward for a test - because they could be taking a test away from someone who really needs it. Our plan – this moonshot that I am describing – will require a giant, collaborative effort from government, business, public health professionals, scientists, logistics experts and many, many more. Work is underway – and we will get on at pace until we get there, round the clock. We are hopeful this approach will be widespread by the spring and, if everything comes together, it may be possible even for challenging sectors like theatres to have life much closer to normal before Christmas. But as I have said before, all this progress is contingent on continued scientific advances and though we’re hopeful, I cannot 100% guarantee that those advances will be made. That is why it is so important that we take these tough measures now. I believe we will continue to drive this virus down and that we will beat this virus before too long. So let’s work together and follow the rules: meet in groups of no more than six. Wash your hands, cover your face, and make space. I will now hand over to Patrick to set out the latest on vaccines and treatments, and then we’ll go to questions from the public and the media.",Prime Minister,Boris Johnson,https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/pm-press-conference-statement-9-september-2020,,DEVELOPMENT
USA,28-06-2014,Barack Obama,"
Weekly Address: Focusing on the Economic Priorities for the Middle Class Nationwide"," Hi, everybody.  This week, I spent a couple days in Minneapolis, talking with people about their lives – their concerns, their successes, and their hopes for the future.

I went because of a letter I received from a working mother named Rebekah, who shared with me the hardships her young family has faced since the financial crisis.  She and her husband Ben were just newlyweds expecting their first child, Jack, when the housing crash dried up his contracting business.  He took what jobs he could, and Rebekah took out student loans and retrained for a new career.  They sacrificed – for their kids, and for each other.  And five years later, they’ve paid off debt, bought their first home, and had their second son, Henry.

In her letter to me, she wrote, “We are a strong, tight-knit family who has made it through some very, very hard times.”  And in many ways, that’s America’s story these past five years.  We are a strong, tight-knit family that’s made it through some very tough times. 

Today, over the past 51 months, our businesses have created 9.4 million new jobs.  By measure after measure, our economy is doing better than it was five years ago.

But as Rebekah also wrote in her letter, there are still too many middle-class families like hers who do everything right – who work hard and who sacrifice – but can’t seem to get ahead.  It feels like the odds are stacked against them.  And with just a small change in our priorities, we could fix that.

The problem is, Republicans in Congress keep blocking or voting down almost every serious idea to strengthen the middle class.  This year alone, they’ve said no to raising the minimum wage, no to fair pay, no to student loan reform, no to extending unemployment insurance.  And rather than invest in education that helps working families get ahead, they actually voted to give another massive tax cut to the wealthiest Americans.

This obstruction keeps the system rigged for those at the top, and rigged against the middle class.  And as long as they insist on doing it, I’ll keep taking actions on my own – like the actions I’ve taken already to attract new jobs, lift workers’ wages, and help students pay off their loans.  I’ll do my job.  And if it makes Republicans in Congress mad that I’m trying to help people out, they can join me, and we’ll do it together.

The point is, we could do so much more as a country – as a strong, tight-knit family – if Republicans in Congress were less interested in stacking the deck for those at the top, and more interested in growing the economy for everybody.  

So rather than more tax breaks for millionaires, let’s give more tax breaks to help working families pay for child care or college.  Rather than protect tax loopholes that let big corporations set up tax shelters overseas, let’s put people to work rebuilding roads and bridges right here in America.  Rather than stack the decks in favor of those who’ve already succeeded, let’s realize that we are stronger as a nation when we offer a fair shot to every American.

I’m going to spend some time talking about these very choices in the week ahead.  That’s because we know from our history that our economy doesn’t grow from the top-down, it grows from the middle-out.  We do better when the middle class does better.  That’s the American way.  That’s what I believe in.  And that’s what I’ll keep fighting for. 

Have a great Fourth of July, everybody – and good luck to Team USA down in Brazil.

Thanks.",President,Barack Obama,https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/the-press-office/2014/06/28/weekly-address-focusing-economic-priorities-middle-class-nationwide,,DEVELOPMENT

United Kingdom,25-May-20,Boris Johnson,Prime Minister's statement on coronavirus (COVID-19): 25 May 2020," Good evening and welcome to the Number Ten Coronavirus Press Conference Before I turn to this evening’s announcements, I want to update you on the latest data 3,532,634 tests for coronavirus have now been carried out in the UK, including 73,726 tests carried out yesterday; 261,184 people have tested positive, that’s an increase of 1,625 cases since yesterday; 8,834 people are in hospital with COVID-19 in the UK, down (12%) from 10,092 this time last week; And sadly, of those who tested positive for coronavirus, across all settings, 36,914 have now died. That’s an increase of 121 fatalities since yesterday. This new figure includes deaths in all settings not just in hospitals. And once again my deepest condolences go out to all those who have lost their loved ones before their time. We must not, and will not, forget them. Two weeks ago, I set out our road map for the next phase of our fight against Covid 19 It is a cautious plan, informed by the evidence about what is safe, and conditional upon our continued progress against the virus. And we are making progress. Thanks to this country’s collective efforts, the key indicators are heading in the right direction. The daily number of deaths is down, the number of new cases is down, our survey evidence suggests the infection rate is falling, and the R has not risen above one. So just over 2 weeks ago, we moved to step 1 of our plan, encouraging those who are unable to work from home to go back to work, with new guidelines setting out how workplaces can be made COVID-secure. At the same time, we allowed people to spend more time outdoors and to meet one member of another household outside, provided they remain 2 metres apart. I also said we would be able to move to step 2 of our plan no earlier than Monday 1 June - a week today. We will set out our formal assessment of the 5 tests that we set for adjusting the lockdown later this week, as part of the 3 weekly-review we are legally required to undertake by Thursday. But because of the progress we are making, I can, with confidence, put the British people on notice of the changes we intend to introduce as we move into step 2. And I think it is important to give that notice, so that people have sufficient time to adjust and get ready before those changes come into effect. Yesterday I set out our intention to begin reopening nurseries and particular years in primary schools, reception, year 1, year 6, from 1 June, followed by some contact for those secondary school pupils with exams next year from 15 June. Some contact for years 10 and 12 from 15 June with their teachers. This announcement has given schools, teachers and parents clarity about our intentions, enabling them to prepare in earnest. The Department for Education is now engaging with teaching unions, councils and school leaders to help schools get ready. Today, I want to give the retail sector notice of our intentions to reopen shops, so they too can get ready. So I can announce that it is our intention to allow outdoor markets to reopen from June 1, subject to all premises being made COVID-secure, as well as car showrooms, which often have significant outdoor space and where it is generally easier to apply social distancing. We know that the transmission of the virus is lower outdoors and that it is easier to follow Covid Secure guidelines in open spaces. That means we can also allow outdoor markets to reopen in a safe way that does not risk causing a second wave of the virus. Then, from 15 June, we intend to allow all other non-essential retail, ranging from department stores to small, independent shops, to reopen. Again, this change will be contingent upon progress against the 5 tests and will only be permitted for those retail premises which are COVID-secure. Today we are publishing new guidance for the retail sector detailing the measures they should take to meet the necessary social distancing and hygiene standards. Shops now have the time to implement this guidance before they reopen. This will ensure there can be no doubt about what steps they should take. While the vast majority of businesses will want to do everything possible to protect their staff and customers, I should add that we will, of course, have the powers we need to enforce compliance where that is required. I want people to be confident they can shop safely, provided they follow the social distancing rules for all premises. The food retail sector has already responded fantastically well, enabling supermarkets to be kept open in a safe way – and we will learn lessons from that experience as we allow other retail to open. These are careful but deliberate steps on the road to rebuilding our country. And we can only take these steps thanks to what we have so far achieved together. We will only be successful if we all remember the basics - so wash your hands, keep social distance, and isolate if you have symptoms – and get a test. I will now hand over to Yvonne Doyle, Medical Director of Public Health England, to take us through today’s slides.",Prime Minister,Boris Johnson,https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/pm-press-conference-statement-25-may-2020,,DEVELOPMENT
China,19-09-2018 00:00,Li Keqiang,Address by H.E. Li Keqiang Premier of the State Council of the People's Republic of China At the Opening Ceremony of The Annual Meeting of the New Champions 2018,"Professor Klaus Schwab,
Your Excellencies Heads of State and Government,
Distinguished Guests,
Ladies and Gentlemen,

It is a great pleasure to join you again in Tianjin. Let me begin by extending, on behalf of the Chinese government, warm congratulations on the opening of the Annual Meeting of the New Champions 2018, and a sincere welcome to all guests from afar.

Since its inception years ago, the Summer Davos Forum has borne witness to the efforts by various countries to tackle the global financial crisis and bring about global recovery. As a gathering of new champions in the business community, the Forum has contributed forward-looking insights to the quest for new pathways and engines for global growth and transformation.

It is encouraging to note the collective global recovery that has emerged following a tortuous journey. This recovery is, to a large measure, driven by the new round of industrial revolution and a new boom in innovation, which has lent fresh impetus to global economic development. That said, our world is faced with rising uncertainties and destabilizing factors, and a growing backlash against globalization. How to boost the new drivers to secure sustained growth of the global economy is a key area of concern for all of us. In this context, the theme of this Annual Meeting, “Shaping Innovative Societies in the Fourth Industrial Revolution”, cannot be more relevant.

In his keynote speech at the World Economic Forum early last year, President Xi Jinping stated China’s firm commitment to economic globalization, free trade and innovation-driven development. As we mark the 40th anniversary of reform and opening-up in China this year, we have introduced a host of major steps to deepen reform, expand opening-up and advance innovation, aiming to promote both China’s own development and global growth.

To boost the new drivers of global growth, we need to firmly uphold economic globalization, which has provided fertile ground for the new industrial revolution. The liberalization of trade and investment and the free flow of factors of production and innovation that accompanied economic globalization have fostered highly interconnected global industrial, innovation and value chains, and enabled the expansion of the new industrial revolution at a speed, scale and depth unseen before. New technologies and new industries emerged in clusters and grew exponentially, making breakthroughs across a wide range of sectors. Economies around the world got involved in this process to varying degrees, with deepening interconnectedness and interdependence. One case in point is the fact that 40% of China’s exports in goods and two thirds of its high-tech exports came from foreign-invested enterprises in China.

The rules-based multilateral trading system is the bedrock of economic globalization and free trade, and provides important safeguards for win-win outcomes. The authority and efficacy of the system should be respected and protected. Some WTO rules do need to be improved. The right approach is for all to sit down as equals to find solutions. Throughout this process, the fundamental principles of free trade should be upheld, the interests and concerns of all parties be accommodated, and the broadest possible consensus on reform be built up. Taking a unilateralist approach will not solve any problems. As no one can thrive on his own in the new industrial revolution, we must draw on each other’s comparative strengths and act together to nurture and promote innovation for shared benefits. Governments need to support businesses in collaborating on innovation in line with market principles and commercial rules, while fully protecting their intellectual property rights. Greater government-business synergy will facilitate the new industrial revolution.

To boost the new drivers of global growth in the new industrial revolution, we need to make development more inclusive. Different from previous industrial revolutions, the new round of industrial revolution is enabled by online platforms in a ubiquitously networked environment. Lower thresholds of entry have presented all with an equal and accessible opportunity to participate and benefit. Empowered by the Internet, anyone, no matter in urban or rural areas, can easily start his own business, make innovations and create wealth. As we can see, the development of smart phone applications has spawned massive industrial clusters, as tens of thousands of people upload their technical solutions and industrial application proposals onto open platforms. To turn possibilities into reality, an enabling environment is indispensable. It is imperative to enhance institutional arrangements for equal rights, equal opportunities and fair rules, follow a balanced and inclusive development approach, make education universal, and better support the vulnerable groups so as to achieve more inclusive development that benefits all.

To boost the new drivers of global growth in the new industrial revolution, we need to pursue integrated innovation and development. The new industrial revolution holds out infinite promise. Today, natural sciences, social sciences and liberal arts are deeply entwined as never before. And different sectors, enterprises and communities can leverage each other’s strengths like never before. Artificial intelligence cuts across an array of disciplines such as algorithm, bionics, sensor technology, and ethics.

E-commerce is another example of integrated innovation and development. Transaction platforms, which are set up by big companies and joined by micro, small and medium-sized enterprises as well as individual business owners, have created conditions for the direct matching of supply and demand, production and sales, resulting in a large number of new forms of business, new models and new jobs. We must seize this momentum to promote wider application of the Internet Plus model, clear the hindrance to optimized allocation of production factors, and establish more inter-disciplinary, multi-stakeholder innovation platforms to open up broader space for the development of the new growth drivers.

Ladies and Gentlemen,

China has made vigorous efforts to nurture new growth drivers. Facing a weak global economy and downward pressure on the Chinese economy in the past several years, China, instead of resorting to massive stimulus, stayed the course of reform and innovation guided by the new development philosophy. Seizing the opportunity of the new industrial revolution and harnessing our advantages in human resources and market potential, we have focused on enhancing the new growth drivers and accelerating the shift from traditional drivers of growth to new ones. Our endeavors have produced better-than-expected results: the new drivers have played a key role in sustaining growth, adjusting the economic structure and expanding employment.

We have made vigorous efforts to streamline administration and cut taxes and fees, unlocking market vitality. Our businesses and the general public often encounter red tape and high cost in their investment and operations and in starting a business and accessing government services. To address these issues, we have substantially reduced the number of items requiring administrative approval, reformed the business system, and taken the initiative to slash taxes and fees. In particular, we rolled out a nationwide program of replacing business tax with VAT in a phased manner, which has lowered institutional transaction costs and production and operation costs. The VAT reform has also improved China’s business environment and enhanced the quality and performance of Chinese companies.

In the past five years, the number of market entities in China has surged by nearly 80% to more than 100 million, and around 70% of new market entities are in active operation. This has not only accelerated the development of new drivers but also given a strong boost to employment. We are now seeing more than 13 million new urban jobs created each year in China. Employment generates income, which produces new consumption and investment, thus fostering a healthy cycle of economic development.

We have adopted a prudent yet accommodative approach to regulation, contributing to a boom in emerging industries. New industries, new forms of business and new models create new driving forces. In the beginning we may only have limited knowledge of the workings of emerging industries, which can be vastly or even completely different from traditional ones. Therefore, mechanically following old regulatory methods will not work, just like one shouldn’t cut the toes to fit new shoes. Instead, we have established a prudent yet accommodative regulatory approach.

Our approach is this: as long as new forms of business and new models do not go against laws or regulations, cross the line of security or damage public interests, we will take an accommodative attitude toward their innovations by leaving sufficient space for their development. If we are not immediately certain about the prospect of these new forms of business and new models, we will allow time to prudently observe their performances instead of imposing a regulatory straitjacket right away.

Any regulatory measures to be taken will be carefully assessed to make sure that they serve the purpose of both deterring malpractices and guiding the sound and orderly development of new forms of business. For those businesses that may entail huge risks or serious social consequences, we will make sure that these risks are dealt with resolutely. This also applies to the regulation of existing forms of business. For those malpractices that involve seeking illegal gains, putting lives and property in danger, cheating and swindling, making or selling fake or substandard goods, and infringing on IPRs, we will mete out serious punishment in accordance with the law, no matter whether they emanate from emerging or traditional businesses, or are conducted online or offline. This regulatory approach has facilitated the rapid rise of emerging industries, such as online shopping, mobile payment and the sharing economy, which have become a hallmark of the thriving new drivers of the Chinese economy.

We have encouraged mass entrepreneurship and innovation, inspiring immense social creativity. China has a workforce of nearly 900 million, among which 170 million have received higher education or training in professional skills. Every year we produce over eight million university graduates and over five million graduates from secondary vocational schools. To tap their vast creative potential, we have made institutional improvements, adopted supportive policies, and fostered an enabling ecosystem for entrepreneurship and innovation. We have strengthened services to encourage university students and returnee migrant workers to start their own businesses as a way to meet their job needs. We have reformed the science and technology management system and expanded the right of researchers to own and benefit from their scientific and technological achievements.

We have sought to exert the primary role of companies in innovation and adopted policy incentives for all companies that increase R&D input. We have built open and sharing platforms to promote collaborative innovation by large, medium and small companies, research institutes, universities and makers, making innovation more efficient and faster. In the past five years, the number of in-force Chinese invention patents has tripled, and the annual volume of technology transactions doubled. The Global Innovation Index 2018 recently published by the World Intellectual Property Organization and other institutions puts China at the 17th place globally, 18 places higher than in 2013.

As an ancient Chinese poem reads, verdant trees and gurgling springs herald a vibrant season. Likewise, the growing ranks of entrepreneurs and innovators are making China a magnet for innovation and business ventures and creating new horizons for economic development powered by new drivers. High-tech industries and advanced manufacturing are spearheading China’s industrial development, new forms and models of services keep emerging, and the industrial structure is upgrading at a faster pace. Online sales have increased by more than 30% annually, and new forms of consumption, such as information and green consumption, have seen rapid growth, raising the share of consumption in economic growth to over 60%. China’s economic structure and growth pattern has also seen a major shift, with new drivers contributing more than one third to economic growth and two thirds to new urban jobs, which lays a solid foundation for sustained and sound economic growth.

Ladies and Gentlemen,

Let me now turn to China’s economic development and policy trends in the current international environment, as this is a topic of much interest. In the first half of this year, China’s economy expanded by 6.8%, staying within the medium-high growth range of 6.7-6.9% for 12 quarters in a row. In the first eight months of this year, over 10 million urban jobs were created, and the surveyed urban unemployment rate was kept at a relatively low level of around 5%. Over 18,000 new companies are set up on an average day, and corporate profits of large industrial companies have maintained double-digit growth. On the whole, the Chinese economy has stayed on the track of steady progress, with growing new drivers and sound fundamentals.

Having said that, China is confronted with a host of difficulties and challenges in economic development. Deeply integrated into the world economy, the Chinese economy is inevitably affected by notable changes in the global economic and trade context. The moderation of growth in domestic investment and consumption has added to the difficulties of some companies and weighed on the stable performance of the economy. Nevertheless, China’s development has always been achieved through overcoming all sorts of difficulties and challenges, which have never been insurmountable. There were numerous occasions when we faced severe challenges, yet each time we managed to pull through and only emerged stronger than ever before.

Today’s China boasts a more solid material and technological foundation, a fairly complete industrial system, and broad space for urban-rural and regional development. It also enjoys huge new market demand generated by the upgrading of consumption and economic restructuring, abundant and increasingly competent human resources, vibrant entrepreneurship and innovation activities across the society, and a reserve of innovative measures and policy tools for macro regulation. All this gives our economy sufficient resilience, potential and space for maneuver. We have the confidence, ability and means to cope with the current difficulties and challenges. The express train of China’s economy will not lose speed but stay on a steady course.

Creating a stable and predictable macro-environment is an important precondition for steady economic performance. China did not resort to massive stimulus in the past; there is no reason why we should do it now. To make sure the economy operates within a proper range, we will continue to develop new and better ways of macro regulation, and keep to the fundamental goals of our macro policies while giving more attention to pre-emptive measures and fine-tuning. Stable employment is always a top priority for a populous country like China; it must be ensured as part of the key parameters delineating the proper range of economic operation. In this connection, we will improve the policy system to put employment first, develop full-fledged job promotion and security mechanisms, strengthen all types of public employment services to attain fairer and more adequate employment.

We will more proactively leverage the fiscal policy in boosting domestic demand and restructuring, and will implement further cuts in taxes and fees. We will pursue a prudent monetary policy with appropriate intensity to keep the macro leverage ratio stable and liquidity reasonably ample. We will see to it that the monetary policy transmission mechanisms are smoothed out in order to channel more funding into the real economy and make financing more accessible and affordable for micro businesses and SMEs.

The recent fluctuations in the RMB exchange rate have been seen by some as an intentional measure on the part of China. This is simply not true. Persistent depreciation of the RMB will only do more harm than good to our country. China is steadfast in its commitment to a market-oriented exchange rate reform. We will not engage in competitive devaluation; we will work to create conditions for keeping the value of the yuan stable. Given the healthy fundamentals of the Chinese economy, our sound balance of international payments and abundant foreign exchange reserves, there is every reason that the RMB exchange rate will remain basically stable at an adaptive and equilibrium level.

The Chinese economy is now at a crucial stage of shifting from traditional drivers of growth to new ones. We will adhere to the general principle of seeking progress while maintaining a stable performance, and focus on supply-side structural reforms to invigorate the market, bolster self-driven development and unleash the potential of China’s domestic demand. Through these efforts, we aim to keep the economy at a medium-high rate of growth and move our industries to a medium-high level.

First, China will work even harder to advance reform and opening-up. We will deepen reforms in all respects, especially reform in fundamental and key areas. By further streamlining administration, delegating powers, strengthening compliance oversight and improving government services, we will further widen market access, raise policy transparency, and exercise fair and impartial regulation to create a market environment in which companies of all ownerships, be they Chinese or foreign-owned, are treated as equals and compete on a level playing field. We will deliver and step up policy measures in support of the private sector, remove all hidden obstacles to their investment, protect all types of property rights, and incentivize entrepreneurial and innovation activities.

This year, we have taken steps to significantly ease market access for foreign investors in services sectors, particularly the financial sector, and lowered tariffs on some imported goods. This is a voluntary choice China has made in light of its own development needs. Going forward, we will open up further to enhance convergence with international economic and trade rules, and foster a world-class business environment. We will encourage more Chinese companies to go global in an orderly way and to pursue third-party cooperation with full sensitivity to local conditions. China’s economic growth now accounts for about 30 percent of the world’s total. The Chinese market is simply too big for any far-sighted business leaders to ignore and we welcome businesses from all over the world to share in China’s development opportunities.

Second, China will work even harder on restructuring. Our country is still at the lower end of the industrial chain. We will continue to encourage businesses to transform and upgrade traditional manufacturing by harnessing new technologies and new business models. At the same time, we will give strong support to emerging industries and services sectors, phase out outdated production capacities through market-driven and law-based measures, and promote integrated development between the primary, secondary and tertiary industries to substantially raise the quality of made–in-China goods and services.

Given that consumption has now become the primary driver of China’s economic growth, we need to increase household incomes through multiple channels to expand the spending power of our consumers. The new personal income tax law to be implemented soon will notably reduce tax burdens on individuals, particularly low- and medium-income earners. We will introduce more effective policies to boost consumption and meet the diversified and individualized needs of our people. We are aware that there are still short planks in infrastructure and livelihood areas. To shore them up, we will expand effective investment and encourage private sector participation in these areas. This will enable us to provide more public goods and services, and boost the economy while improving living standards.

Third, China will work even harder to stimulate innovation. Raising China’s innovative capacity requires a multi-pronged approach. We will foster an innovation-friendly environment in which basic research and applied basic research are supported, more corporate R&D spending is encouraged, and innovation outcomes are commercialized at a faster pace. We will introduce more effective policies and new mechanisms to make innovation platforms such as makerspaces and incubators more market-based and professional, and achieve integrated and synergized development of industries, universities, research institutes and end users in both online and offline activities.

To protect IPR is to protect and promote innovation. China cannot realize innovation-driven development without respect for and protection of IPR. Therefore, we have put in place a complete legal framework for IPR protection and set up special tribunals to handle IPR cases. Since China’s accession to the WTO, intellectual property royalties paid by Chinese companies to overseas proprietors have increased by 14 times. Going forward, we will further strengthen law enforcement and introduce a more rigorous mechanism of punitive compensation for IPR infringements to deter violations and better protect innovators from all sectors.

Ladies and Gentlemen,

The new industrial revolution unfolding before our eyes is changing the world in profound ways, ushering in an era of unlimited space for innovation and infinite possibilities to develop and prosper. China is ready to join the rest of the world in nurturing new drivers for the world economy and harnessing the industrial revolution for the wellbeing of all peoples. To conclude, let me wish the Annual Meeting a full success!",Premier,Xi Jinping,https://www.fmprc.gov.cn/mfa_eng/wjdt_665385/zyjh_665391/t1597396.shtml,,INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS
China,27-05-2016 00:00,H.E. Wang Yi,An Open China: Guangxi Embracing the World,"Diplomatic Envoys,
Distinguished Guests,
Dear friends from the media,

Good Morning!

One of the important missions of China's diplomacy is to serve domestic development. To do this, we need to help various provinces, regions and municipalities in China to open up and reach out for mutually beneficial cooperation. This is why the Foreign Ministry has designed this new platform to present Chinese provinces, regions and municipalities to the world. This particular platform enables diplomatic envoys posted in China from around the world to directly engage and have face-to-face exchange with different parts of the country without having to leave Beijing.

Our first event featured Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region. That day was like the Day of Ningxia when it impressed all of us with its awe-inspiring scenery, rich history, significant development and promising future. Two months after that event, the various cooperation programs agreed upon then are all being followed upon smoothly. Today, we are presenting to you Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region in China's southwest border area. We are delighted to have with us Mr. Peng Qinghua, Secretary of the CPC Guangxi Committee, and Mr. Chen Wu, Governor of Guangxi. Let's give them a big hand. Guangxi is highly committed to this event as it has sent senior officials from all departments of its provincial government and 14 mayors. Also, on behalf of the Foreign Ministry, I take this opportunity to express our heartfelt thanks to the diplomatic envoys and distinguished guests for your presence.

In its journey of reform and opening-up, China has been developing itself through integration into the world while contributing to shared prosperity with all countries with its own development. This is epitomized by the success of Guangxi.

Thirty years ago, what the name Guangxi immediately evokes was the breathtaking mountains and rivers in Guilin. The saying that Guilin scenery is peerless in the world was widely known. And many got to know about Guangxi through Guilin. But in those days, poor transportation and lack of development in China made visiting Guilin a luxury.

Over a decade ago, the name Guangxi conjures the image of China-ASEAN Expo. In 2002, China and ASEAN officially started building the free trade area based on the fist FTA agreement China has ever signed. In 2010, China-ASEAN Free Trade Area materialized. Seizing such an important opportunity, Guangxi launched the China-ASEAN Expo and from there started to open up at a faster pace. It established close cooperative relations with Southeast Asian nations for mutual benefit and extended its reach to all corners of the world. Now, Guangxi enjoys friendly exchanges and business ties with over 150 countries, making it an important window for opening up in China's southeast border areas.

Today in 2016, the name Guangxi immediately reminds people of the 21st Century Maritime Silk Road, an important initiative put forward by President Xi Jinping during his visit to Southeast Asia three years ago. As early as 2,000 years ago, Guangxi was already serving as one of China's oldest ports and points of departure of the ancient maritime silk road. Today if you look at the map, you can see Guangxi remains one of the important departure points and indispensable part of the 21st Century Maritime Silk Road. To the west, the modern maritime silk road connects Guangxi with distant destinations; to the south, railways and roads brings Guangxi and Indo-China Peninsula together into one big corridor running through the peninsula; to the north, land routes stretching across western China extends Guangxi's reach all the way to the heartland of the Eurasian Continent and even Europe.

President Xi Jinping has called for Guangxi to build itself into an international passage to ASEAN, a strategic pivot for the opening-up and development of southwest, central and southern China and a crucial window connecting the Silk Road Economic Belt and the 21st Century Maritime Silk Road. We are confident that with the concerted efforts of the people of various ethnicities, Guangxi, as President Xi envisioned, will take off on the two strong wings of the Silk Road Economic Belt and the 21st Century Maritime Silk Road, and soar high in the new century. At the same time, Guangxi will have more robust cooperation with countries within and beyond the region and contribute more to the common development and prosperity of all countries.

Today we are here celebrating Guangxi. The Lanting Forum provides the stage, and Guangxi is the real star. This stage belongs to Guangxi. Through this event, I hope all the diplomatic envoys and distinguished guests present here will turn your eyes to and support Guangxi. I also encourage you to develop closer relations and explore broader cooperation with Guangxi. With that, let me give the floor to Mr. Peng Qinghua, Secretary of CPC Guangxi Committee.

Thank you!",State Councilor and Foreign Minister of the People's Republic of China,Xi Jinping,https://www.fmprc.gov.cn/mfa_eng/wjdt_665385/zyjh_665391/t1368920.shtml,,INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS
China,28-03-2014 00:00,Xi Jinping,Speech by H.E. Xi Jinping President of the People's Republic of China At the Körber Foundation,"Mr. Richard von Weizsäcker, Former President of Germany,
Mr. Helmut Schmidt, Former Chancellor of Germany,
Dr. Klaus Wehmeier, Vice President of Körber Foundation,
Ladies and Gentlemen,
Dear Friends,

Guten Tag. Good Afternoon. It gives me great pleasure to meet you and speak to you at the invitation of former President Weizsäcker and the Körber Foundation. Let me begin by expressing my sincere thanks to the Körber Foundation for its commitment to promoting mutual understanding between Europe and China.

I visited Germany five years ago. Back then, the international financial crisis was unfolding, the European debt issue just emerged, and the global economy was shadowed by dark clouds of uncertainty and anxiety. Against such a backdrop, China and Germany agreed during my visit to lift bilateral cooperation in various fields to a higher level and overcome difficulties with joint actions.

Five years on, I am glad to see the progress Europe has made in addressing the sovereign debt issue and clear signs of economic recovery. Germany, as the anchor of European economy and champion of European integration, has played a key role in this endeavor and gained international applause. We are heartened by the progress made in the joint efforts of China, Germany and Europe to fight the international financial crisis.

China-Germany relationship is never so strong as it is today, with bilateral exchanges and cooperation reaching unprecedented depth, breadth and warmth. All this shows that by drawing on each other's strengths, we can not only achieve common development to the benefit of both countries and peoples, but also contribute significantly to promoting world peace and development.

Ladies and Gentlemen,
Dear Friends,

What has made it possible for China and Germany to make such good progress in exchanges and cooperation? A key factor, in my view, is that thanks to mutual efforts made over the years, our two sides have come to appreciate that countries different in history, culture, national condition and social system need to deepen mutual understanding, treat each other with sincerity, be ready to listen to the other's views, and put oneself in the other's position in addressing related issues.

Mutual understanding is the foundation of state-to-state relations. Deeper mutual understanding will cement and broaden the foundation of our exchanges and cooperation.

Thanks to over 30 years of rapid growth achieved through reform and opening up, China's GDP now ranks the second place in the world. As China continues to grow, some people start to worry. Some view China through colored glasses and believe that China will inevitably become a threat as it develops further. They even portray China as being the terrifying Mephisto who would some day suck the soul of the world. Absurdity as such couldn't be more ridiculous, yet some people, regrettably, are never tired of preaching it. This shows that prejudice is indeed hard to overcome.

A review of human history tells us that what keeps people apart are not mountains, rivers or oceans, but a lack of mutual understanding. As Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz once observed, only the sharing of our talents will light the lamp of wisdom.

Let me take this opportunity to talk to you about China's reform and development, focusing on China's commitment to peaceful development. I hope this will help you gain a better understanding of China.

China made the solemn declaration to the world long ago that it is committed to pursuing peaceful development. It strives to develop itself by upholding world peace and maintain world peace through its development. Pursuing peaceful development is China's response to international concern about the direction of China's development. Moreover, it demonstrates the Chinese people's confidence and commitment to realize its development goals. Such confidence and commitment are rooted in the rich heritage of the Chinese civilization, in our understanding of conditions for achieving the goals of China's development, and in our keen appreciation of the general trend of global development.

The Chinese nation is a peace-loving nation. And the most profound pursuit of a nation has its origin in the national character formed through generations. The Chinese civilization, with a history of over 5,000 years, has always cherished peace. The pursuit of peace, amity and harmony is an integral part of the Chinese character which runs deep in the blood of the Chinese people. In ancient times, the following axioms were already popular in China: ""A warlike state, however big it may be, will eventually perish."" ""Peace is of paramount importance."" ""Seek harmony without uniformity."" ""Replace weapons of war with gifts of jade and silk."" ""Bring prosperity to the nation and security to the people."" ""Foster friendship with neighbors."" ""Achieve universal peace."" These axioms have been passed down in China from generation to generation. China was long one of the most powerful countries in the world. Yet it never engaged in colonialism or aggression. The pursuit of peaceful development represents the peace-loving cultural tradition of the Chinese nation over the past several thousand years, a tradition that we have inherited and carried forward.

China has set the following goal for its future development: By 2020, China will double its 2010 GDP and per capita income of urban and rural residents and finish the building of a society of initial prosperity in all respects. By the mid-21st century, China will have turned itself into a modern socialist country that is prosperous, strong, democratic, culturally advanced and harmonious. We refer to this goal as the Chinese dream of the great renewal of the Chinese nation. We will quickly enhance China's overall prosperity and raise the happiness index for over 1.3 billion Chinese people as long as we are on the right path. Yet, it will not be as easy to make this happen for every individual. Consider the difference between eight people sharing one meal and 80 or even 800 people sharing the meal. No matter how big the meal is, the individual share of it will differ dramatically for diners different in number. We are keenly aware that China will remain the world's largest developing country for a long time to come and that to make life better for the over 1.3 billion people calls for strenuous efforts. Two things will enable China to focus on development: a harmonious and stable domestic environment, and a peaceful and stable international environment.

History is the best teacher. It faithfully records the journey that every country has gone through and offers guidance for its future development. In the over 100 years from the Opium War in 1840 prior to the founding of the People's Republic of China in 1949, China was ravaged by wars, turmoils and foreign aggressions. To the average Chinese, it was a period of ordeal too bitter to recall. The war of aggression against China committed by Japanese militarism alone inflicted over 35 million Chinese military and civilian casualties. These atrocities are still fresh in our memory. We Chinese have long held the belief that we should not do onto others what we would not want others do to us. China needs peace as much as human beings need air and plants need sunshine. Only by pursuing peaceful development and working together with all other countries to uphold world peace can China realize its goal and make even greater contribution to the world.

Dr. Sun Yat-sen, the pioneer of China's democratic revolution, had this to say, ""The trend of the world is surging forward. Those who follow the trend will prosper, and those who go against it will perish."" History shows that a country, in order to achieve prosperity, must recognize and follow the underlying trend of the changing world. Otherwise, it will be abandoned by history. What is the trend of today's world? The answer is unequivocal. It is the trend of peace, development, cooperation and win-win progress. China does not subscribe to the outdated logic that a country will invariably seek hegemony when it grows in strength. Can the old practice of colonialism and hegemonism still work in today's world? Definitely no. It can only lead to a dead end, and those who stick to this beaten track will only hit a stone wall. The only alternative is peaceful development. That is why China is committed to it.

Facts speak louder than words. Over the past decades, China has consistently followed an independent foreign policy of peace and made it abundantly clear China's foreign policy is aimed at maintaining world peace and promoting common development. China has stated on numerous occasions that it opposes hegemonism and power politics in all forms, does not interfere in the internal affairs of other countries, and will never seek hegemony or expansion. This is our guiding policy which underlies China's political system. And this is a policy we follow in practice. At the same time, China will firmly uphold its sovereignty, security, and development interests. No country should expect China to swallow the bitter fruit that undermines its sovereignty, security and development interests.

In short, China's pursuit of peaceful development is not an act of expediency, still less diplomatic rhetoric. Rather, it is a conclusion we have reached based on an objective assessment of China's history, its present and future. It represents confidence in thinking and readiness to practice it. As peaceful development benefits both China and the world, we cannot think of any reason why we should not pursue this approach that has proven so effective.

Ladies and Gentlemen,
Dear Friends,

Last November, the Third Plenum of the 18th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China was held, at which a top-level decision on furthering China's reform and opening-up program was made, and a roadmap and timetable for carrying out reform was adopted. The overarching goal is to improve and develop the socialist system with Chinese characteristics, advance the modernization of national governance system and capabilities, and thus lay down a solid institutional foundation for China's long-term development.

China is accelerating its efforts to promote a new type of industrialization, application of IT technologies, urbanization and agricultural modernization, which will unleash tremendous demand in investment and consumption. With a per capita GDP of close to US$7,000, China is in a crucial stage of fast upgrading the mix of private consumption and industrial structure. In 2013, the service sector overtook industrial manufacturing for the first time as a bigger share of the Chinese economy. The share of the service sector and its importance in the Chinese economy will continue to rise, and so will high value-added, high-tech industries; and new growth areas of consumption and drivers of growth will keep emerging. In the next five years, China is projected to import over US$10 trillion of goods and make over US$500 billion of overseas investment, and over 500 million Chinese tourists will make overseas visits.

Lao Tzu, an ancient Chinese philosopher, observed that ""a big country should be like the lower reaches of a river."" It means that a big country should be as inclusive as the lower reaches of a river that admit numerous tributaries. China is eager to strengthen dialogue and exchange of views with the rest of the world and listen to the voices of other countries with an open and inclusive mind. We hope that time will dispel prejudices and misunderstanding. We also hope that the world will view China in an objective, historical and multi-dimensional light, and see the true and full picture of a dynamic China.

China will never pursue development at the expense of other countries' interests or follow a beggar-thy-neighbor policy. With the lofty cause of peace and development of the world in mind, we will contribute the Chinese vision to the management of contemporary international relations, offer the Chinese solution for improving global governance, and work with the international society to meet various challenges of the 21st century.

Ladies and Gentlemen,
Dear Friends,

The Chinese nation and the German nation are two great nations who have made important contribution to promoting the progress of human civilization. Germany is famous for its advanced science, technology and developed manufacturing industries. It has also produced many luminaries with global renown in philosophy, literature and music, and many of their works are popular in China: poems and other literary works by Johann W. von Goethe, Friedrich Schiller and Heinrich Heine, tomes of philosophy by Gottfried W. Leibniz, Immanuel Kant, Georg W. F. Hegel, Ludwig Feuerbach, Karl Marx, Martin Heidegger and Herbert Marcuse, and enchanting melodies by Johann S. Bach, Ludwig van Beethoven, Robert Schumann and Johannes Brahms, to name just a few. Many Chinese, including myself, enjoy their works, marvel at the power of thinking and have thus gained a deeper understanding of the world and life.

As a German saying goes, ""Mountains never meet, but people do."" The Chinese and the Germans have a long history of exchanges and profound friendship. As I speak to you, I recall a German widely respected and loved in China. His name is John Rabe. Over 70 years ago, Japanese troops invaded the Chinese city of Nanjing and committed a heinous crime by killing more than 300,000 Chinese soldiers and civilians. When the killing continued, Mr. Rabe contacted a dozen other foreigners in Nanjing and set up the Nanjing Safety Zone, sheltering over 200,000 Chinese. Mr. Rabe kept a detailed record of the massacre in his diary, which has become an important evidence for study on this historical incident. In 1996, the John Rabe House was jointly opened by China and Germany in Nanjing. At the end of last year, renovation of the Rabe tomb in Berlin, funded by the Nanjing municipal government, was completed. We in China cherish the memory of Mr. Rabe as a man who demonstrated great compassion for life and love of peace.

I also think of another German friend-Mr. Norbert Goerres, who was a grape grower. Between 2000 and 2009, he and his assistant Hans-Werner Beu went to Zaozhuang in the Chinese province of Shandong 17 times to help local farmers improve grape growing and grafting. Norbert also granted a local winery, free of charge, the right to use the centuries-old brand of his family business. Norbert and Hans also paid the tuition of eight students from poor local families. In 2007, Hans was suddenly diagnosed with cancer. Before he died, he asked Norbert to give 2,000 yuan to two of the students he helped to enable them to finish senior high school. When Norbert gave the money to the two students on 1 August 2008, all those present were moved to tears.

These are just two of the many touching stories of friendship between the Chinese and Germans. Over the years, many Germans have contributed personally to the growth of China-German relations and the reform and opening-up endeavors of China.

The 21st century is a century of cooperation. A broad vision will open up broad vistas for our future cooperation. The next five to ten years will be a crucial period in reform and development for both China and Germany. The deepening of such reform will expand our cooperation to more areas and inject new impetus for it. I am convinced that with the integration of ""Made in Germany"" and ""Made in China"", we will not only produce quality products together, but also make life better and more inspiring for our two peoples. China and Germany are respectively the biggest economy in Asia and Europe. Bringing closer our two economies, the two pillars of growth in Asia and Europe, will surely boost the world economy.

Ladies and Gentlemen,
Dear Friends,

This year marks the centenary of World War I and the 75th anniversary of World War II. Gotthold Ephraim Lessing said, ""History should not encumber memory. It should enlighten common sense."" Former Chancellor Willy Brandt said, ""He who forgets the past will get sick in his soul."" And we Chinese often say, ""History, if not forgotten, can serve as a guide for the future."" We in China have chosen a path of peaceful development based on what we have gone through. We sincerely hope that all other countries will follow the path of peaceful development and work together to build a harmonious world of enduring peace and common prosperity.

Thank you!",President,Xi Jinping,https://www.fmprc.gov.cn/mfa_eng/wjdt_665385/zyjh_665391/t1148640.shtml,,INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS
USA,26-07-2021 00:00,Joe Biden,"Statement of President Joe Biden on the Passing of Civil Rights Leader, Bob Moses","Speaking in the spring of 1964 about his plans for Freedom Summer, Bob Moses summed up the heroic effort to register Black voters in the Deep South with a question: “What kind of society will we be?” 

Throughout his remarkable life, Bob devoted his heart and soul to lead, teach, and organize generations of Americans to answer that question by making real the promise of our nation – that we are all created equal and deserve to be treated equally throughout our lives.

He did so with uncommon grace, calm, and humility despite every bullet, arrest, and unrelenting brutality he faced.

The violent and murderous response to the Freedom Summer he organized helped galvanize support for the landmark Voting Rights Act of 1965.  A celebrated educator by training and by heart, he understood education is a great equalizer and helped countless students, and our nation, realize their dreams and full potential.

From the polling stations of Mississippi and in classrooms of our nation, Bob always showed up and never, ever gave in. In his memory, let us continue his unfinished work and answer the question he asked us once before – to be a society that delivers on the promise of this nation.

With attacks on the right to vote unseen since the days of the Jim Crow system Bob helped to dismantle, I call on Congress again to pass the For the People Act and the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act. Let us build the coalition of Americans of every race and background that he once formed to meet the urgency of the moment. And let us follow his towering legacy and ensure every American is treated with the dignity and respect they deserve.

Russia,21-07-2000,Vladimir Putin,Introductory Remarks at a Meeting on the Prospects of the Development of the Far East and the Trans-Baikal Region," Good morning,

We have gathered here in this Far Eastern town in order to discuss the problems of the region, in order to analyse everything that hinders its development and to identify the main issues that have to be addressed as a matter of priority.

I would very much like the outcome of today’s conversation to form the basis of a large-scale national programme for the development of this region.

<…>

The processes taking place in the Asia-Pacific region make us try and rise above the daily problems in which we are constantly mired and to look at the place of the region where we are meeting, its role for Russia in global terms and in terms of long-term national interests.

I don’t want to dramatise the situation, but unless we make real efforts soon, then even the indigenous population will in several decades from now be speaking mainly Japanese, Chinese and Korean.

So the question of the future development of the Far East and the Trans-Baikal region is very acute, I would say even dramatic. In fact, the existence of the region as an inseparable part of Russia is at stake. We cannot afford to lose the momentum of development and allow the area to fall behind. From what we have today, it is clear that this is precisely the direction in which we have been drifting.

The main reason for this is well known. It lies on the surface: it is the huge distance from the industrialised regions, from the centre of the country. You know better than I do the demographic situation and the recent outflow of the population. After the main work on the Baikal-Amur Railway (BAM) was completed and after the break-up of the Soviet Union, people left for their native republics. That was to be expected. But the outflow continues, and this is alarming.

I think many people who live here have often asked a legitimate question: what kind of a Far East does Russia need considering all its daunting problems? Does it need the Far East only as a source of raw materials or as a “window” to Asia for integration with the Asia-Pacific region? No concrete problem can be solved any longer without answering this fundamental question.

I am convinced that there can be only one answer: for the Far East, Russia is not the “mainland”. Russia is here under our feet.

The Far East and the Trans-Baikal region account for 40% of the country’s territory. This fact alone speaks volumes. So it is our duty to revise our policy in the Far East. It should not be a policy of individual regions of the Russian Federation, it should be the policy of the Russian state.

Compounding the situation is the lack of internal cohesion of the territories and economic ties, good partnership contacts, even sometimes between the leaders. So the primary task is to turn the region from a loose conglomerate of territories into a single organism. And in that, the work of the Presidential Envoy, Konstantin Pulikovsky, has an immense role to play.

The lack of a clear position (a systemic vision, to use the current term) hinders all your efforts and disrupts any economic programme. The region’s development is too slow. Resources are invested here, even though I have mentioned that they are not sufficient and that they have not been disbursed. But the returns on the inputs are nevertheless insignificant.

Goods produced by local manufacturers are often uncompetitive. Yet this land has rich subsoil resources, rivers and seas. There is every opportunity to turn the area into a zone of prosperity, as our neighbours have managed to do. Otherwise we will forever be watching wistfully new houses going up on the other shore.

Today the region is implementing the presidential programme I have mentioned. And yet there are no noticeable changes, no tangible results. Obviously, if the programme does not work, it has to be revised.

The Government must seek to concentrate all the resources directed to the regions on priority tasks and not to scatter them. I think the new administrative resources of the federal districts should be used.

Now let me quickly go through the most important current issues. Poor power supply in the region is due to failure to pay for electricity, and this is the number one problem. It is imperative to ensure payment discipline.

The number two issue is a balanced tariff policy. The region has every opportunity for that: it has hydro-energy resources, oil, gas and coal. The way to solve the problem is to speed up the introduction of the Bureiskaya Hydropower Plant. That issue calls for our constant attention.

The next challenge is gasification of the Sakhalin, the Khabarovsk and Primorye regions. We should also give thought to oil refineries and to how they work and where the resources from these refineries go. I am referring to Khabarovsk and Komsomolsk-on-Amur.

Most of the region’s problems hinge on the issue of energy tariffs. The Federal Energy Commission and the Russian Energy Ministry must take another hard look at the issue and decide what can really be done about it.

The infrastructure of the region is not an integrated whole. Hence the colossal importance of the development of all kinds of communication. The fact that transportation routes are wide apart is a real scourge for the region, considering its vast territory. In this situation, major transportation lines lie idle.

The loading of railway transport is an acute problem. Frankly, one sometimes wonders why the country devoted such huge resources, so much effort and time to building the BAM? And we have to know precisely the benefits that would accrue from the implementation of the Transeco project. Some experts believe it would only complicate the railways situation in the area. The Government of course should study this issue more carefully.

We pin great hopes on completing the building of the roads Chita–Khabarovsk and Bolshoi Niver–Yakutsk–Magadan. I think it will relieve transportation flows and help to optimise the arrangements for bringing supplies to the north. At present, it remains to complete just 500 km out of the 6,000 km of the new roads. I think they should be put into operation sooner so that the whole network can start working.

The Transportation Ministry and the Federal Road Fund need to find the resources to complete these stretches of the road immediately. The resources are there, but they must not be scattered.

Informatisation of the country as a whole and the huge region of the Far East in particular is a very important issue. It is not our agenda today, which is a pity because this is an area where we are lagging behind.

<…>

Another big problem of your region, also linked with transportation, is the long distance from the Russian fish market. We are aware that fishermen have to look for partners in the external market and have to pay for supplies of materials, funds, fuel and containers with valuable species of seafood, and do so at dumping prices. So an important challenge is to reduce the share of the products that are processed abroad. The answer to the problem lies not only in the area of finance and economics. Ports need to be modernised, the fleet of vessels needs to be renewed and processing enterprises retooled. It is incumbent upon the Transport Ministry, the State Fisheries Committee and the Federal Border Service to draw up proposals on how to change the situation.

The Kuril Islands merit special attention. Let me report to you that the Government is planning to discuss the social and economic problems of the Kurils at an early meeting.

A similar situation prevails in the forestry and logging complex. We need deeper processing inside the country. We need our own finished products and we cannot tolerate a situation when, like in the case with fish, valuable species of timber go abroad to return as foot stools.

The remoteness of the Far Eastern region dictates the need for it to become actively involved in the markets in the Asia-Pacific region. In this, the economic interests of the region and the geopolitical interests of the Russian state coincide. Only, we must make sure in what capacity local companies enter the Asia-Pacific markets. They should act as Russian companies, as part of the Russian economy. You understand what I mean. When our fishermen stay away from our ports for years (incidentally, this tells us something about their quality of life here), when ships fly foreign flags, that is a different story altogether. At present, Russia’s position in the region is weak. Its share in the trade here is just 3%-4%, not to speak about the primitive structure of our exports.

Thank you for your attention. ",President,Vladimir Putin,http://en.kremlin.ru/events/president/transcripts/statements/21494,,DEVELOPMENT
USA,11-02-2021 00:00,Joe Biden,A Letter to the Speaker of the House of Representatives and the President of the Senate on the Continuation of the National Emergency With Respect to Libya,"Dear Madam Speaker: (Dear Madam President:) 

Section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)) provides for the automatic termination of a national emergency unless, within 90 days before the anniversary date of its declaration, the President publishes in the Federal Register and transmits to the Congress a notice stating that the emergency is to continue in effect beyond the anniversary date.  In accordance with this provision, I have sent to the Federal Register for publication the enclosed notice stating that the national emergency declared in Executive Order 13566 of February 25, 2011, with respect to Libya is to continue in effect beyond February 25, 2021.

Libyans confront ongoing instability originating from actions Colonel Muammar Qadhafi, his government, and close associates took against the people of Libya in 2011.  Civil conflict in Libya will continue until Libyans resolve their political divisions and foreign military intervention ends.  Because many of these divisions relate to access to resources, a serious risk remains that, if not protected, Libyan state assets will be misappropriated by parties determined to undermine the ongoing United Nations’ peace process, including former members of the Qadhafi government, members of the Qadhafi family, or Qadhafi’s close associates.  The diversion of these resources could prolong and deepen the current instability in Libya, which benefits ISIS and other terrorist groups that pose a serious threat to the national security of the United States and the security of regional partners.  We run the risk of military escalation if sanctions do not remain in effect, particularly since those who reject dialogue and obstruct and undermine Libya’s democratic transition remain interested in exploiting the wealth of the Libyan people to advance their narrow self-interest and perpetuate conflict in the country.

The situation in Libya continues to pose an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States, and we need to protect against the diversion of assets or other abuse by persons hindering Libyan national reconciliation, including Qadhafi’s family and associates.

Therefore, I have determined that it is necessary to continue the national emergency declared in Executive Order 13566 with respect to Libya.

USA,28-05-2021 00:00,Joe Biden,Statement by President Joe Biden on the Rise of Anti-Semitic Attacks,"In the last weeks, our nation has seen a series of anti-Semitic attacks, targeting and terrorizing American Jews.

We have seen a brick thrown through window of a Jewish-owned business in Manhattan, a swastika carved into the door of a synagogue in Salt Lake City, families threatened outside a restaurant in Los Angeles, and museums in Florida and Alaska, dedicated to celebrating Jewish life and culture and remembering the Holocaust, vandalized with anti-Jewish messages.

These attacks are despicable, unconscionable, un-American, and they must stop.

I will not allow our fellow Americans to be intimidated or attacked because of who they are or the faith they practice.

We cannot allow the toxic combination of hatred, dangerous lies, and conspiracy theories to put our fellow Americans at risk.

As Attorney General Garland announced yesterday, the Department of Justice will be deploying all of the tools at its disposal to combat hate crimes.

In recent days, we have seen that no community is immune. We must all stand together to silence these terrible and terrifying echoes of the worst chapters in world history, and pledge to give hate no safe harbor.

May is Jewish American Heritage Month, when we honor Jewish Americans who have inextricably woven their experience and their accomplishments into the fabric of our national identity; overcoming the pain of history, and helping lead our struggle for a more fair, just, and tolerant society.

Let us all take up that work and create a nation that stands for, and stands up for, the dignity and safety of all of our people",President,Joe Biden,https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/05/28/statement-by-president-joe-biden-on-the-rise-of-anti-semitic-attacks/,,EXTREMISM
USA,08-03-2021 00:00,Joe Biden,Statement by President Biden on International Women’s Day,"Women’s history is American history — and world history. On International Women’s Day, we celebrate the achievements, contributions, and progress of women and girls in the United States and around the globe.
 
My Administration is committed to honoring women by investing in their opportunity, security, and wellbeing. I was proud to issue an Executive Order today establishing the White House Gender Policy Council, to ensure that every domestic and foreign policy we pursue rests on a foundation of dignity and equity for women. My Administration is also committed to ensuring that women are represented equally at all levels of the federal government. That starts with Vice President Harris, who broke through a barrier that stood for more than two centuries. And it includes a record number of diverse women whom I’ve nominated to serve in Cabinet-level roles and appointed to senior-level positions.
 
In our nation, as in all nations, women have fought for justice, shattered barriers, built and sustained economies, carried communities through times of crisis, and served with dignity and resolve. Too often, they have done so while being denied the freedom, full participation, and equal opportunity all women are due. Their contributions have been downplayed. Their stories have been neglected. That is why International Women’s Day is also a time for us to recommit ourselves to the cause of equity and equality for women the world over, and to shine a light on the systemic obstacles that fuel gender disparities and undermine women’s potential.
 
Despite persistent obstacles, women are leading every day. Over the past year, women have played a critical, often outsized role in responding to the global coronavirus pandemic. They are our vaccine researchers and public health officials. They are our doctors and nurses. They are our essential workers — so many of whom are women of color — in fire stations and nursing homes, on farms and in grocery stores, in schools and in shelters.
 
Around the world, we are seeing decades of women’s economic gains erased by this pandemic. It’s forcing millions more girls out of school, which could impact economic growth for decades to come. Incidents of violence against women in their homes and communities have spiked. And, as is so often the case, COVID-19 is hitting the poorest and most marginalized women the hardest. These global trends damage all of us, because we know that governments, economies, and communities are stronger when they include the full participation of women — no country can recover from this pandemic if it leaves half of its population behind.
 
Elevating the status of women and girls globally is the right thing to do — it is a matter of justice, fairness, and decency, and it will lead to a better, more secure, and more prosperous world for us all.  On International Women’s Day, let us recommit to the principle that our nation, and the world, is at its best when the possibilities for all of our women and girls are limitless.",President,Joe Biden,https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/03/08/statement-by-president-biden-on-international-womens-day/,,OTHERS
Russia,27-01-2005,Vladimir Putin,Speech at the Memorial Ceremony Dedicated to the 60th Anniversary of the Liberation of the Nazi Concentration Camp of Auschwitz-Birkenau,"Dear friends,

They say that time heals. And it does. But now, standing in one of the most horrific concentration camps, 60 years after its liberation, you feel horror and anger, and shudder at everything that took place here. It is impossible, inconceivable to think that people are capable of such barbarity, that they could be subject to what is truly total insanity. And it is impossible to resign oneself to what really happened here.

But before our eyes, there are rails on which entire trains of victims arrived, and gas chambers with carefully designed crematoriums. All these terrible objects that we can see give us no reason to doubt that a finely-tuned factory of death worked constantly here. And we will never stop asking: how could this happen?

Auschwitz does not just appeal to our memory, it appeals to our reason. Here, on this earth, soaked in blood and the ashes of victims of Nazism, we can truly see the future that fascism was preparing for Europe, a continent that developed on humanitarian values and democratic traditions, and passed through the inquisition to the reformation and enlightenment. And here, on this tortured earth, we must say clearly and simply: any attempts to rewrite history, to put victims and executioners, liberators and occupiers on the same level, are immoral and incompatible with the thinking of people who consider themselves Europeans.

Today we pay tribute to the memory of everyone who was brutally murdered in cold blood by the fascists here in Auschwitz. We bow our heads before the tens of millions of citizens of various countries of the world, citizens who passed through the hell of concentration camps, were shot and tortured, or died from starvation and disease. We bow our heads before the victims of the Holocaust, before all the victims of the inhuman war that was unleashed by Nazism.

We mourn them and remember the immortal victory of the army of the anti-Hitler coalition, which broke the back of fascism. We remember all our allies. We pay tribute to the courage of Soviet soldiers, 600,000 of whom gave their lives for the liberation of Poland. And we will never forget that the Soviet Union paid the most terrible, impossibly high price for this victory – 27 million lives!

But today we must not just remember the past, but recognise all the threats of the modern world, one of which is terrorism. It is no less insidious or dangerous than nazism, and just as ruthless. Thousands of innocent people have already become its victims. Just as there could not be good or bad Nazis, so there cannot be good or bad terrorists. Double standards are not only unacceptable here – they are deadly dangerous for civilisation.

Dear friends,

Today’s ceremony is essentially the opening of the 60th anniversary of the end of the Second World War. The culmination of this will be the May celebrations in Moscow, where many of those present here will gather.

Let us do everything we can so that we, moderm people, politicians and state leaders, are not ashamed for our words and for our deeds, so that we can be honest and sincere before everyone who helped to bring this victory closer at the price of their suffering, blood, tears and lives, before everyone who has remained here forever, in Auschwitz. And we are responsible for making sure that what happened here never repeats – never, nowhere and with no one.

Thank you.",President,Vladimir Putin,http://en.kremlin.ru/events/president/transcripts/statements/22802,,INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS
USA,22-09-2020 00:00,Donald Trump,Remarks by President Trump to the 75th Session of the United Nations General Assembly,"PRESIDENT TRUMP: It is my profound honor to address the United Nations General Assembly.

Seventy-five years after the end of World War II and the founding of the United Nations, we are once again engaged in a great global struggle. We have waged a fierce battle against the invisible enemy — the China virus — which has claimed countless lives in 188 countries.

In the United States, we launched the most aggressive mobilization since the Second World War. We rapidly produced a record supply of ventilators, creating a surplus that allowed us to share them with friends and partners all around the globe. We pioneered life-saving treatments, reducing our fatality rate 85 percent since April.

Thanks to our efforts, three vaccines are in the final stage of clinical trials. We are mass-producing them in advance so they can be delivered immediately upon arrival.

We will distribute a vaccine, we will defeat the virus, we will end the pandemic, and we will enter a new era of unprecedented prosperity, cooperation, and peace.

As we pursue this bright future, we must hold accountable the nation which unleashed this plague onto the world: China.

In the earliest days of the virus, China locked down travel domestically while allowing flights to leave China and infect the world. China condemned my travel ban on their country, even as they cancelled domestic flights and locked citizens in their homes.

The Chinese government and the World Health Organization — which is virtually controlled by China — falsely declared that there was no evidence of human-to-human transmission. Later, they falsely said people without symptoms would not spread the disease.

The United Nations must hold China accountable for their actions.

In addition, every year, China dumps millions and millions of tons of plastic and trash into the oceans, overfishes other countries’ waters, destroys vast swaths of coral reef, and emits more toxic mercury into the atmosphere than any country anywhere in the world. China’s carbon emissions are nearly twice what the U.S. has, and it’s rising fast. By contrast, after I withdrew from the one-sided Paris Climate Accord, last year America reduced its carbon emissions by more than any country in the agreement.

Those who attack America’s exceptional environmental record while ignoring China’s rampant pollution are not interested in the environment. They only want to punish America, and I will not stand for it.

If the United Nations is to be an effective organization, it must focus on the real problems of the world. This includes terrorism, the oppression of women, forced labor, drug trafficking, human and sex trafficking, religious persecution, and the ethnic cleansing of religious minorities.

America will always be a leader in human rights. My administration is advancing religious liberty, opportunity for women, the decriminalization of homosexuality, combatting human trafficking, and protecting unborn children.

We also know that American prosperity is the bedrock of freedom and security all over the world. In three short years, we built the greatest economy in history, and we are quickly doing it again. Our military has increased substantially in size. We spent $2.5 trillion over the last four years on our military. We have the most powerful military anywhere in the world, and it’s not even close.

We stood up to decades of China’s trade abuses. We revitalized the NATO Alliance, where other countries are now paying a much more fair share. We forged historic partnerships with Mexico, Guatemala, Honduras, and El Salvador to stop human smuggling. We are standing with the people of Cuba, Nicaragua, and Venezuela in their righteous struggle for freedom.

We withdrew from the terrible Iran Nuclear Deal and imposed crippling sanctions on the world’s leading state sponsor of terror. We obliterated the ISIS caliphate 100 percent; killed its founder and leader, al-Baghdadi; and eliminated the world’s top terrorist, Qasem Soleimani.

This month, we achieved a peace deal between Serbia and Kosovo. We reached a landmark breakthrough with two peace deals in the Middle East, after decades of no progress. Israel, the United Arab Emirates, and Bahrain all signed a historic peace agreement in the White House, with many other Middle Eastern countries to come. They are coming fast, and they know it’s great for them and it’s great for the world.

These groundbreaking peace deals are the dawn of the new Middle East. By taking a different approach, we have achieved different outcomes — far superior outcomes. We took an approach, and the approach worked. We intend to deliver more peace agreements shortly, and I have never been more optimistic for the future of the region. There is no blood in the sand. Those days are, hopefully, over.

As we speak, the United States is also working to end the war in Afghanistan, and we are bringing our troops home. America is fulfilling our destiny as peacemaker, but it is peace through strength. We are stronger now than ever before. Our weapons are at an advanced level like we’ve never had before — like, frankly, we’ve never even thought of having before. And I only pray to God that we never have to use them.

For decades, the same tired voices proposed the same failed solutions, pursuing global ambitions at the expense of their own people. But only when you take care of your own citizens will you find a true basis for cooperation. As President, I have rejected the failed approaches of the past, and I am proudly putting America first, just as you should be putting your countries first. That’s okay — that’s what you should be doing.

I am supremely confident that next year, when we gather in person, we will be in the midst of one of the greatest years in our history — and frankly, hopefully, in the history of the world.

Thank you. God bless you all. God bless America. And God bless the United Nations.",President,Donald Trump,https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefings-statements/remarks-president-trump-75th-session-united-nations-general-assembly/,,INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS
United Kingdom,13-May-10,David Cameron,"PM's speech at the Department of Business, Innovation and Skills","Prime Minister: Thank you very much. It’s great to be here. The very first Department of State I ever walked into as a junior researcher over 20 years ago was actually the DTI - I think I walked through that door over there. The ministerial team in those days included talents as diverse as Alan Clark and Eric Forth, so if that coalition can work together, this one certainly can! I wanted to come here first for some very good reasons. First of all, we face huge economic challenges, and I think it’s so important, as Vince has just said, that we really demonstrate that this country is open for business; that we want to promote trade overseas; we want to get our economy moving; and we want to get our banks lending. I see this as a big economic department with a huge task in front of it, and I want all of you to work together to help deliver that. In doing so, you’ve got an incredibly talented team of ministers. Vince Cable is an absolute star in terms of economic policy and economic thinking; he’s demonstrated that over the last few years in parliament. To bring him together with David Willetts, who is also known as ‘two brains’ - you’ve got two ministers so far, and there are more to come this afternoon I promise you. But you already have some of the top talent that is available in parliament, to make a great success of this. The more I think about the endeavour, on which we have embarked, the more excited I become. Because this coalition government, if we can make it work - and I believe we can - is a five-year government; and one of the things that everyone says about our economy is that we need to make more long-term decisions. I think we have an incredible opportunity to make long-term decisions for the good of our economy, for the good of our country. In doing so, I will try, as Prime Minister, to do something else that hasn’t always happened in the past, and that is to appoint good ministers and keep them in post for a decent period of time. The average length of ministerial life, I think, is around one year and three months; we have got to do better than that when we have these big challenges in front of us. Two last things. Yes, this is a coalition government, but in many ways, all governments are a coalition - a coalition between politicians and civil servants. I want us to do better than has been done before, in making sure that coalition really works. Part of that is about respecting the work that civil servants do. Having worked as a special advisor 20 years ago, having watched government over the last 20 years, I know that the British Civil Service is an incredible machine. It requires, of course, the right coordination, the right leadership, the right combination with politicians. But it is a great machine. Where else in the world can you see a transition to government be so smooth and so effective, even when you’re putting together a political coalition? I am expecting great things of you in this department. The economic challenge we face is the biggest we have faced over the last 40 years. We have two big economic departments, the Treasury and BIS; we have great political leadership, I believe, in both. I want you all to get down to work, to make sure we send out a big signal: this country is open for business. We want to get the economy growing, get the banks lending, and make sure that we build a strong and, as Vince said, a more balanced economy for the future. So today is a day to receive your new ministers; there will be three more talented ministers turning up very shortly. Tomorrow is the day to roll up your sleeves and get down to work, to help us build a strong economy here in the UK. Thank you very much indeed.",Prime Minister,David Cameron,https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/pms-speech-at-the-department-of-business-innovation-and-skills,,DEVELOPMENT
Russia,12-12-2000 00:00,Vladimir Putin,Address at a gala reception on Constitution Day,"Dear friends, colleagues, citizens of Russia.

I congratulate you on this national holiday – Day of the Russian Constitution.

Every year we mark it not only out of respect for the country’s basic law. We do it more out of respect for ourselves, for the rules and norms of life which we, the people of Russia, have achieved through much suffering and which we ourselves defined. To live by the Constitution, by the law, is not just a necessity or a civic duty, it is the privilege of a free people. People who know the value of their rights and who recognise the same rights for others. Only in this case are we not individual citizens, but the Russian people. Not a population, but a civil society. Not a geographic space, but one nation, a power that holds us, people of Russia, together.

On Constitution Day, we are particularly aware of the magnitude of our common responsibility to Russia, especially the responsibility of those who work for the state. Those who must keep the state machinery in working order and prevent it from running down, stalling or idling. And, last but not least, who guarantee that this sophisticated and costly vehicle does not cut political corners, that political shadow players and gamblers do not take over its controls. Only when the Constitution is firmly in control – and only under these circumstances – will the authorities never dare to conduct experiments on people, or on the state. And every one of us – whether a judge, a civil servant, or a politician – knows full well what he serves, and realises that the freedom and dignity of our citizens is a matter of national security.

Dear friends, seven years have passed since the adoption of the basic law – a fleeting moment in Russian history. But it has been packed with enough events to fill a century for others. It was this Constitution that largely determined Russia’s new image. It was criticised – and sharply – even before it was adopted. And through all the following years there were demands to re-carve, review and recast it. There were claims that it catered only to short-lived political interests, and so had no outlook or future prospects. But time has put everything in its place. Our Constitution has not only reflected the spirit of long-awaited change – it has also provided a strong basis for the country’s steady development.

For a good many years we have been mastering this vital democratic instrument, learning to make effective use of it, improving state machinery, and cementing the country’s common legal and economic space. The point I want to make is this: all our federal reforms, as you well know – both the rebuilding of the Federation Council and the establishment of federal districts – clearly fit into the regulatory framework of the Constitution. We were simply obligated to come together, we are obligated to put our state together, and we will do it.

The New Year is just over two weeks away. We have done a good deal in the outgoing year but there is still more to do to make the life of our people better still. Russia is entering the new century and the new millennium on a rising wave. In doing so, it is guided by the basic principles of democracy and the country’s Constitution.

And I would like to propose a toast: “To the Constitution of the Russian Federation! To the welfare of Russian citizens! To the prosperity of our great country!”",President,Vladimir Putin,http://en.kremlin.ru/events/president/transcripts/statements/24273,,NATIONALISM
Russia,12-11-2019 00:00,Vladimir Putin,Meeting of Russian Pobeda (Victory) Organising Committee,"Good afternoon, colleagues.

Next year will mark the 75th anniversary of the Great Victory in World War II, the Great Patriotic War, and will be held in Russia as the Year of Remembrance and Glory. We need to join our efforts to fill it with heartfelt, expressive and memorable content, and preclude any chance of adopting a perfunctory or formal approach to organising events wherever they may take place, in a major city or a small rural town. There are heroes of the Great Patriotic War – front-line soldiers and home front workers – everywhere. They must receive the highest and most cordial attention and care. Heads of regions, and even more so, heads of municipalities must be aware of the needs of each veteran and respond to their requests quickly and in full.

Particular attention should be paid to preserving the memory of the Great Patriotic War and its heroes. I am talking about updating museum displays and holding special exhibitions, events and scientific and practical conferences, including systematic introduction of archival documents into scientific circulation, so that they are accessible to the public, including the use of modern digital technology and online platforms.

Local authorities must constantly control issues related to the maintenance of military memorials. Strict compliance with the standards of inspecting and registering newly found common graves envisaged by law must also be a priority.

It is also important to actively support corresponding public initiatives, cooperate with search parties, volunteers, local historians and enthusiasts, those who are interested in this and invest their heart, time and years of their lives – everyone who educates young people with their actions rather than just words and helps teenagers and children take in such values as love for their Fatherland and understanding what Fatherland means for people and citizens and why it must be cared for. This is a truly educational mission based on personal example, sincere actions and important results that are clear to everyone.

This must be considered in the development of the new programme, Patriotic Education of the Citizens of the Russian Federation. The current programme expires in 2020, and I am asking the Ministry of Education together with the Ministry of Science and Higher Education, the Ministry of Culture, and other concerned agencies and specialised public organisations to not work too long on the new document.

A well thought out, and importantly, honest patriotic agenda in accordance with the views of today’s youth must strengthen in the generations to come the basic values tested by life itself and reflect our traditions and national identity as well as the entire history of Russia with its trials and triumphs.

The Great Patriotic War, of course, plays a special role in this. It has left a deep trace in the lives of the peoples of the Soviet Union and the Russian Federation and is inseparable from the history of every Russian family. This is the foundation of what we have done and will do; I mean protection of the historic truth and the names of our heroes.

Attempts to distort this historical truth never stop. In addition to distortions by the heirs of Nazi accomplices, now this has been happening at some respectable international institutions and European agencies.

You know that the European Parliament’s recent resolution virtually equated Nazi aggressors with the Soviet Union. They just about blame the USSR, along with Nazi Germany, for unleashing the Second World War. As if they had forgotten who attacked Poland on September 1, 1939, and the Soviet Union on June 22, 1941.

And anyone who tries to argue with such unfounded and brazen lies are in advance accused of an “information war against a democratic Europe”, this is a quote.

Our answer to these lies is the truth. We will continue to speak about events and facts of the Great Patriotic War and to disclose and publish full archival materials. It seems that some of our opponents either cannot read or write, or they do not have eyes, and they pretend to know nothing.

But we will speak about this, including the victories and defeats of the Red Army, the tragic fate of our war prisoners, the courage of the underground and the shame of the collaborators, the Holocaust tragedy and crimes against civilians, and the atrocities of the nationalists who were Hitler’s minions.

I am convinced that there are no, and cannot be any, “unprofitable” or “inconvenient” pages in history. This is necessary in the aggregate, as a single whole, both for us and for our future generations, which is especially important, without any embellishment or distortion.

Memory and pride should unite us, make us stronger, help young people fully realise their engagement with the Motherland, the great deeds of their ancestors, and responsibility for the future of Russia. This is what should become the main spiritual meaning of the Year of Memory and Glory. And the main activity, I repeat, should be real and targeted support, concern for veterans.

Let us discuss all of this.

USA,17-08-2013,Barack Obama,"
Weekly Address: Working to Implement the Affordable Care Act"," Hi, everybody.  Over the past few weeks, I’ve been visiting with Americans across the country to talk about what we need to do to secure a better bargain for the middle class.

We need to rebuild an economy that rewards hard work and responsibility; an economy built firmly on the cornerstones of middle-class life.  Good jobs.  A good education.  A home of your own.  A secure retirement.  And quality, affordable health care that’s there when you need it.

Right now, we’re well on our way to fully implementing the Affordable Care Act.  And in the next few months, we’ll reach a couple milestones with real meaning for millions of Americans.

If you’re one of the 85% of Americans who already have insurance, you’ve already got new benefits and protections under this law that you didn’t before.  Free checkups, mammograms, and contraceptive care.  Discounted prescription medicine on Medicare.  The fact you can stay on your parents’ plan until you turn 26.  And much, much more.  And it’s okay if you’re not a fan of the Affordable Care Act – you can take advantage of these things anyway.

If you don’t have insurance, beginning on October 1st, private plans will actually compete for your business.  You can comparison shop in an online marketplace, just like you would for cell phone plans or plane tickets.  You may be eligible for new tax credits to help you afford the plan that’s right for you.  And if you’re in the up to half of all Americans who’ve been sick or have a preexisting condition, this law means that beginning January 1st, insurance companies have to cover you – and they can’t use your medical history to charge you more than anybody else. 

You can find out more about the law, and how to sign up to buy your own coverage right now at HealthCare.gov.  Tell your friends and neighbors without insurance about it, too.  And tell your kids that there’s a new, easy way to buy affordable plans specifically tailored to young people.

Many Members of Congress, in both parties, are working hard to inform their constituents about these benefits, protections, and affordable plans.  But there’s also a group of Republicans in Congress working hard to confuse people, and making empty promises that they’ll either shut down the health care law, or, if they don’t get their way, they’ll shut down the government.

Think about that.  They’re actually having a debate between hurting Americans who will no longer be denied affordable care just because they’ve been sick – and harming the economy and millions of Americans in the process.  And many Republicans are more concerned with how badly this debate will hurt them politically than they are with how badly it’ll hurt the country.

A lot of Republicans seem to believe that if they can gum up the works and make this law fail, they’ll somehow be sticking it to me.  But they’d just be sticking it to you. 

Some even say that if you call their office with questions about the law, they’ll refuse to help.  Call me old-fashioned – but that’s lousy constituent service.  And it’s not what you deserve.

Your health insurance isn’t something to play politics with.  Our economy isn’t something to play politics with.  This isn’t a game.  This is about the economic security of millions of families.

See, in the states where governors and legislatures and insurers are working together to implement this law properly – states like California, New York, Colorado and Maryland – competition and consumer choice are actually making insurance affordable. 

So I’m going to keep doing everything in my power to make sure this law works as it’s supposed to.  Because in the United States of America, health insurance isn’t a privilege – it is your right.  And we’re going to keep it that way.

Thanks.  And have a great weekend.",President,Barack Obama,https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/the-press-office/2013/08/17/weekly-address-working-implement-affordable-care-act,,DEVELOPMENT

Weekly Address: We Will Degrade and Destroy ISIL"," As Commander in Chief, my highest priority is the security of the American people.  And I’ve made it clear that those who threaten the United States will find no safe haven.  Thanks to our military and counterterrorism professionals, we took out Osama bin Laden, much of al Qaeda’s leadership in Afghanistan and Pakistan, and leaders of al Qaeda affiliates in Yemen and Somalia.  We’ve prevented terrorist attacks, saved American lives and made our homeland more secure. 

Today, the terrorist threat is more diffuse, from al Qaeda affiliates and other extremists—like ISIL in Syria and Iraq.  As I said this week, our intelligence community has not yet detected specific ISIL plots against our homeland.  But its leaders have repeatedly threatened the United States.  And, if left unchecked, these terrorists could pose a growing threat beyond the Middle East, including to the United States.  So we’re staying vigilant.  And we’re moving ahead with our strategy to degrade and ultimately destroy this terrorist organization.

To meet a threat like this, we have to be smart.  We have to use our power wisely.  And we have to avoid the mistakes of the past.  American military power is unmatched, but this can’t be America’s fight alone.  And the best way to defeat a group like ISIL isn’t by sending large numbers of American combat forces to wage a ground war in the heart of the Middle East.  That wouldn’t serve our interests.  In fact, it would only risk fueling extremism even more. 

What’s needed now is a targeted, relentless counterterrorism campaign against ISIL that combines American air power, contributions from allies and partners, and more support to forces that are fighting these terrorists on the ground.  And that’s exactly what we’re doing.     

We’re moving ahead with our campaign of airstrikes against these terrorists, and we’re prepared to take action against ISIL in Syria as well.  The additional American forces I’ve ordered to Iraq will help Iraqi and Kurdish forces with the training, intelligence and equipment they need to take the fight to these terrorists on the ground.  We’re working with Congress to expand our efforts to train and equip the Syrian opposition.  We’ll continue to strengthen our defenses here at home.  And we’ll keep providing the humanitarian relief to help Iraqi civilians who have been driven from their homes and who remain in extreme danger. 

Because we’re leading the right way, more nations are joining our coalition.  This week, Arab nations agreed to strengthen their support for the new Iraqi government and to do their part in the fight against ISIL, including aspects of the military campaign.  Saudi Arabia will join the effort to help train and equip moderate Syrian opposition forces.  And retired Marine general John Allen—who during the Iraq war worked with Sunnis in Iraq as they fought to reclaim their communities from terrorists—will serve as our special envoy to help build and coordinate our growing coalition.

Today, every American can be proud of our men and women in uniform who are serving in this effort.  When our airstrikes helped break the siege of the Iraqi town of Amerli [Ah-MER-lee], one Kurdish fighter on the ground said, “It would have been absolutely impossible without the American planes.”  One resident of that city said—“thank you, America.”

Today we’re showing the world the best of American leadership.  We will protect our people.  We will stand with partners who defend their countries and rally other nations to meet a common threat.  And here at home—thirteen years after our country was attacked—we continue to stand tall and proud.  Because we’re Americans.  We don’t give in to fear.  We carry on.  And we will never waver in the defense of the country we love.",President,Barack Obama,https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/the-press-office/2014/09/13/weekly-address-we-will-degrade-and-destroy-isil,,EXTREMISM
USA,24-09-2014,Barack Obama,"
Remarks by the President at U.N. Security Council Summit on Foreign Terrorist Fighters"," Thank you, His Excellency, the Secretary-General, for his statement.  I'll now make a statement in my capacity as President of the United States.

Mr. Secretary-General, heads of state and government distinguished representatives, thank you for being here today. 

In the nearly 70 years of the United Nations, this is only the sixth time that the Security Council has met at a level like this.  We convene such sessions to address the most urgent threats to peace and security.  And I called this meeting because we must come together -- as nations and an international community -- to confront the real and growing threat of foreign terrorist fighters.   

As I said earlier today, the tactic of terrorism is not new. So many nations represented here today, including my own, have seen our citizens killed by terrorists who target innocents.  And today, the people of the world have been horrified by another brutal murder, of Herve Gourdel, by terrorists in Algeria.  President Hollande, we stand with you and the French people not only as you grieve this terrible loss, but as you show resolve against terror and in defense of liberty.

What brings us together today, what is new is the unprecedented flow of fighters in recent years to and from conflict zones, including Afghanistan and the Horn of Africa, Yemen, Libya, and most recently, Syria and Iraq.

Our intelligence agencies estimate that more than 15,000 foreign fighters from more than 80 nations have traveled to Syria in recent years.  Many have joined terrorist organizations such as al Qaeda’s affiliate, the Nusrah Front, and ISIL, which now threatens people across Syria and Iraq.  And I want to acknowledge and thank Prime Minister Abadi of Iraq for being here today. 

In the Middle East and elsewhere, these terrorists exacerbate conflicts; they pose an immediate threat to people in these regions; and as we’ve already seen in several cases, they may try to return to their home countries to carry out deadly attacks.  In the face of this threat, many of our nations -- working together and through the United Nations -- have increased our cooperation.  Around the world, foreign terrorist fighters have been arrested, plots have been disrupted and lives have been saved. 

Earlier this year at West Point, I called for a new Partnership to help nations build their capacity to meet the evolving threat of terrorism, including foreign terrorist fighters.  And preventing these individuals from reaching Syria and then slipping back across our borders is a critical element of our strategy to degrade and ultimately destroy ISIL.

The historic resolution that we just adopted enshrines our commitment to meet this challenge.  It is legally binding.  It establishes new obligations that nations must meet.  Specifically, nations are required to “prevent and suppress the recruiting, organizing, transporting or equipping” of foreign terrorist fighters, as well as the financing of their travel or activities.  Nations must “prevent the movement of terrorists or terrorist groups” through their territory, and ensure that their domestic laws allow for the prosecution of those who attempt to do so.

The resolution we passed today calls on nations to help build the capacity of states on the front lines of this fight -- including with the best practices that many of our nations approved yesterday, and which the United States will work to advance through our Counterterrorism Partnerships Fund.  This resolution will strengthen cooperation between nations, including sharing more information about the travel and activities of foreign terrorist fighters.  And it makes clear that respecting human rights, fundamental freedoms and the rule of law is not optional -- it is an essential part of successful counterterrorism efforts.  Indeed, history teaches us that the failure to uphold these rights and freedoms can actually fuel violent extremism.

Finally, this resolution recognizes that there is no military solution to the problem of misguided individuals seeking to join terrorist organizations, and it, therefore, calls on nations to work together to counter the violent extremism that can radicalize, recruit, and mobilize individuals to engage in terrorism.  Potential recruits must hear the words of former terrorist fighters who have seen the truth -- that groups like ISIL betray Islam by killing innocent men, women and children, the majority of whom are Muslim. 

Often it is local communities -- family, friends, neighbors, and faith leaders -- that are best able to identify and help disillusioned individuals before they succumb to extremist ideologies and engage in violence.  That’s why the United States government is committed to working with communities in America and around the world to build partnerships of trust, respect and cooperation. 

Likewise, even as we are unrelenting against terrorists who threaten our people, we must redouble our work to address the conditions -- the repression, the lack of opportunity, too often the hopelessness that can make some individuals more susceptible to appeals to extremism and violence.  And this includes continuing to pursue a political solution in Syria that allows all Syrians to live in security, dignity, and peace. 

This is the work that we must do as nations.  These are the partnerships we must forge as an international community.  And these are the standards that we now must meet.  Yet even as we’re guided by the commitments that we make here today, let me close by stating the obvious.  Resolutions alone will not be enough.  Promises on paper cannot keep us safe.  Lofty rhetoric and good intentions will not stop a single terrorist attack.

The words spoken here today must be matched and translated into action, into deeds -- concrete action, within nations and between them, not just in the days ahead, but for years to come. For if there was ever a challenge in our interconnected world that cannot be met by any one nation alone, it is this:  terrorists crossing borders and threatening to unleash unspeakable violence.  These terrorists believe our countries will be unable to stop them.  The safety of our citizens demand that we do.  And I’m here today to say that all of you who are committed to this urgent work will find a strong and steady partner in the United States of America. 

I now would like to resume my function as President of the Council.  And I will now give the floor to the other members of the Security Council.",President,Barack Obama,https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/the-press-office/2014/09/24/remarks-president-un-security-council-summit-foreign-terrorist-fighters,,INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS
Russia,11-09-2005 00:00,Vladimir Putin,Closing Remarks at Meeting with the Armed Forces Command Staff," I would like to say a few words on what I heard in the Defence Minister’s report. First of all, of course, I would like to thank the Minister for his substantial report that makes it possible to assess the state of the Armed Forces and gives a clear picture of their development prospects. This is very important and it is the first condition for resolving all the problems we face in this area.

As I said earlier, we have a very large amount of work to do. I will not list now all the tasks we have before us. To come back to the Defence Minister’s report, they include developing our strategic forces and reaching an optimum balance between the different components of the Armed Forces. I would like to say a few words about some matters that may seem of secondary importance but are nonetheless, I think, worthy of our attention.

This concerns above all the matter of legality, of ensuring that legality is observed within the Armed Forces. The Defence Minister gave a detailed and critical overview of this problem, but I see that you will also hear today a report from the Deputy Prosecutor-General, the Chief Military Prosecutor, and he will inform you on the actual situation in this area.

Comrade generals and officers, I want to draw your attention to the need to completely exclude any possible commercialisation of the Armed Forces and to ensure that the Armed Forces’ material resources are not used in any way to pursue commercial objectives that have nothing whatsoever to do with the Armed Forces’ activities and the missions the people of Russia have given the Defence Ministry. That is the first point I wanted to make.

There is another point I want to make, and in this respect I want to say that the Prosecutor-General’s Office and the Military Prosecutor’s Office will continue their inspections. This concerns the rule of law in general — the rules concerning ill-treatment of servicemen, the laws in this area must be observed. Concerning the ill-treatment of servicemen, I think this is an important matter. The Minister made it clear that sources of information wishing to cast the Armed Forces in a negative light exist. This was and always will be the case. But at the same time there are grounds for criticism of the Armed Forces in this area. What I want to draw your attention to in this respect is that the junior commanders, sergeants, that the Minister spoke about should, of course, be teachers and educators. But the Minister’s report raised another issue at the same time, namely that the Armed Forces have been so far unable to ensure that these people are of the right quality and have the right training. Of course, ensuring recruitment of the necessary people and providing them with training is the right direction to move in. But there is also a need today to bring officers back to the barracks in some places. I am not saying that they are absent in general, but in many units there are simply no officers present. This is the daily life of the Armed Forces and you know about this. I would ask you to give this matter your attention.

As for the issue of the military chairs in universities, the public needs to be provided with clear and detailed information on the steps being taken in this area. People should know in detail about what is planned and when it is planned. This way no one will have grievances, and people will be able to understand the logic of your decisions and fit their own decisions into this logic, plan their own lives with regard to the Armed Forces, their education plans and so on.

Now, concerning the issue raised by the Chief of General Staff, I think that Yury Nikolayevich [Baluyevsky] is right. We do indeed see – and not only the military is talking about this – a certain gap between the Armed Forces’ needs and the direction developments in the military industry are taking. I will certainly reflect on this matter and together with the Prime Minister we will propose an appropriate solution.

Thank you.",President,Vladimir Putin,http://en.kremlin.ru/events/president/transcripts/statements/23260,,OTHERS

May 9 is nearing – the most important and sacred holiday for our country, for every Russian family.

I am addressing all citizens of Russia.

We are marking the 75th anniversary of the Great Victory this year.

We began preparing for this major date in advance, at the federal level and in all regions. You know that, without exaggeration, the whole country participates in Victory Day celebrations.

On Victory Day, we honour and pay tribute to the heroes who defended our country and the whole world, and sacrificed their lives in order to save the lives of others. The winners, the veterans set the highest moral standard for us, and passed on to us their beliefs and faith.

China,19-11-2015 00:00,Xi Jinping,Remarks by H.E. Xi Jinping President of the People's Republic of China At Session One of the 23rd APEC Economic Leaders' Meeting,"Mr. Chair,
Dear Colleagues,

Last November, we gathered in Beijing and mapped out the blueprint for Asia-Pacific development. Today, one year later, we are meeting again for the same objective of deepening cooperation for the common development of the Asia-Pacific. We would like to thank the Philippines for the tremendous efforts it has made for the meeting.

Two days ago, G20 leaders met in Antalya to feel the pulse of the world economy. It was generally believed that despite the many uncertainties in the world economy, we still have reasons to be confident about the future.

The Asia-Pacific is a mirror of the world. Against the backdrop of sluggish recovery, weak demand and divergence in the world economy, Asia-Pacific economies are also confronted with such challenges as shaky foundation for growth, transition from old to new drivers and incomplete structural adjustment. That said, the Asia-Pacific remains the locomotive of the world economy. We should proceed from the reality, look into the future, and make full use of the important platform of APEC to advance win-win cooperation, thus enabling the Asia-Pacific to continue to be the engine of global growth.

- We should improve the strategic framework for medium- to long-term cooperation in the Asia-Pacific with the eyes on the future. A great thinker in ancient China said, ""Without a clear vision, nothing can be accomplished."" Just like a person must have a dream, cooperation must have a direction. Asia-Pacific cooperation should be forward-looking to shape the future. It should have an ambitious program and aim to fulfill its grand vision.

This is exactly what we have been after over these years. Last year, we started the process of the Free Trade Area of the Asia-Pacific (FTAAP), and adopted the APEC Blueprint on Connectivity. This year, we have continued our efforts to formulate strategic frameworks and action plans in numerous areas. We should continue to carry out strategic, forward-looking and progressive cooperation, and identify the goals, measures and timetables of cooperation in priority areas. China has submitted a report on the progress of implementation of the outcomes of the Beijing APEC meeting. We hope that all the members could give priority to the implementation of the agreement reached among the leaders.

- We should find new drivers for the Asia-Pacific economy through reform and innovation. In the face of new circumstances and new challenges, we need to rely on both reform and innovation to unlock the tremendous potential and release the driving force for the Asia-Pacific economy.

We should promote the shift of growth model and adjust the economic structure. We should speed up innovation to boost the dynamism of the economy. China endorses the formulation and implementation of the APEC Services Cooperation Framework, and is in favor of giving SMEs and micro-businesses greater access to the global market. We should implement well the APEC Strategic Blueprint for Promoting Global Value Chain Development and Cooperation to boost the value of economic growth. We should expand and deepen cooperation in high-potential areas such as urbanization, internet economy and blue economy in order to release positive energy and cultivate new growth points for the economy. I would like to announce that China will host the first APEC High-Level Forum on Urbanization next year to build a platform for APEC exchanges and cooperation on urbanization.

- We should build an open Asia-Pacific economy by advancing integration. APEC should play a leading and coordinating role to strengthen the mechanism for the sharing of information on regional trade agreements, promote their coordinated development, and establish an institutional platform for the building of an open Asia-Pacific economy.

We should speed up the process and complete the building of the FTAAP as early as possible. We should finish the joint strategic studies as scheduled, and come up with conclusions and suggestions that are in the long-term interests of all parties, in order to prepare the ground for the transition into the next stage. While advancing regional trade agreements, the parties should continue to embrace openness and inclusiveness, seek win-win cooperation, and work together to uphold the multilateral trading regime. We should continue to provide strong guidance for concluding the Doha Round negotiations, and strive for balanced, meaningful and development-oriented outcomes of the tenth WTO ministerial conference.

- We should translate consensus into outcomes through concrete actions. ""Seeing is not as good as knowing, and knowing is not as good as acting."" The connectivity blueprint adopted at the Beijing meeting is important for overcoming the bottlenecks in Asia-Pacific's development, and therefore must be pushed forward with greater efforts. The Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB) is an important platform for regional connectivity. China and the relevant countries are making intensive preparations for its establishment. The bank is expected to be formally launched before the end of the year, and the selection of candidate projects for the AIIB has already started. The Chinese initiative of the Silk Road Economic Belt and the 21st Century Maritime Silk Road (""Belt and Road"") is making steady progress, with economic corridors identified as the priority area of cooperation. The projects supported by the Silk Road Fund have started operation.

China will continue to contribute to APEC's capacity building. Last year, China announced the decision to donate US$10 million to APEC and provide 1,500 training opportunities for its developing members. Up to now, China has already delivered US$2.8 million as the first tranche of donation and trained nearly 1,000 personnel.

Given the ever closer ties and growing convergence of interests between the Asia-Pacific and the rest of the world, it is all the more important for APEC to strengthen cooperation with other international mechanisms. Last year, as the host of APEC, China actively engaged with Australia, the host of the G20, and enabled good coordination between the two mechanisms. Next year, China and Peru will respectively play host to the G20 and APEC meetings. We are ready to strengthen coordination with Peru and other parties to ensure the success of the two important meetings.

Dear Colleagues,

The future of Asia-Pacific belongs to each and every member of this big family. Last year in Beijing, we advocated mutual trust, inclusiveness, cooperation and mutual benefit as the guiding principles of Asia-Pacific partnership. These principles have captured the essence of our past experience of cooperation and represent our solemn commitment to the future. As such, they provide important guidance for our future cooperation.

China will deepen mutually beneficial cooperation and connectivity with countries in the Asia-Pacific, and maintain a peaceful and stable environment for development. China has already put forward the proposal for its 13th Five-Year Plan, which is underpinned by the concept of innovative, coordinated, green, open and shared development. China has the determination, confidence and ability to keep its economy on a sound track of sustained growth, and deliver more opportunities and benefits for the Asia-Pacific.

Thank you.",President,Xi Jinping,https://www.fmprc.gov.cn/mfa_eng/wjdt_665385/zyjh_665391/t1327715.shtml,,DEVELOPMENT
USA,01-06-2013,Barack Obama,"
Weekly Address: Congress Should Take Action to Continue Growing the Economy"," Hi, everybody.  Over the past four and a half years, we’ve been fighting our way back from an economic crisis and punishing recession that cost millions of Americans their jobs, their homes, and the sense of security they’d worked so hard to build. 

And thanks to the grit and determination of the American people, our businesses have now created nearly 7 million new jobs over the past 38 months.

An auto industry that was flatlining is once again the heartbeat of American manufacturing – with Americans buying more cars than we have in five years.

Within the next few months, we’re projected to begin producing more of our own crude oil at home than we buy from other countries – the first time that’s happened in 16 years.

Deficits that were growing for years are now shrinking at the fastest rate in decades.  The rise of health care costs is slowing, too.

And a housing market that was in tatters is showing new signs of real strength.  Sales are rising.  Foreclosures are declining.  Construction is expanding.  And home prices that are rising at the fastest rate in nearly seven years are helping a lot of families breathe a lot easier. 

Now we need to do more. 

This week, my administration announced that we’re extending a program to help more responsible families modify their mortgages so they can stay in their homes. 

But to keep our housing market and our economy growing, Congress needs to step up and do its part.  Members of Congress will be coming back next week for an important month of work.  We’ve got to keep this progress going until middle-class families start regaining that sense of security.  And we can’t let partisan politics get in the way.

Congress should pass a law giving every responsible homeowner the chance to save about $3,000 a year on their mortgage by refinancing at historically low interest rates. 

Congress should put more Americans to work rebuilding our crumbling roads and bridges, like the one that collapsed last week in Washington state.  We’d all be safer, and the unemployment rate would fall faster.

And Congress should fix our broken immigration system by passing commonsense reform that continues to strengthen our borders; holds employers accountable; provides a pathway to earned citizenship; and also modernizes our legal immigration system so that we’re reuniting families and attracting the highly-skilled entrepreneurs and engineers who will help our economy grow. 

So there are a lot of reasons to feel optimistic about where we’re headed as a country – especially after all we’ve fought through together.  We’ve just got to keep going.  Because we’ve got more good jobs to create.  We’ve got more kids to educate.  We’ve got more doors of opportunity to open for anyone who’s willing to work hard enough to walk through those doors.

And if we work together, I’m as confident as I’ve ever been that we’ll get to where we need to be.

Thanks and have a great weekend.",President,Barack Obama,https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/the-press-office/2013/06/01/weekly-address-congress-should-take-action-continue-growing-economy,,DEVELOPMENT
Russia,25-09-2001,Vladimir Putin,Speech in the Bundestag of the Federal Republic of Germany,"Distinguished Mr President,

Distinguished ladies and gentlemen,

I am sincerely grateful for this opportunity to speak in the Bundestag. This is the first such opportunity for a Russian head of state in the entire history of Russian-German relations. And this honor granted to me today only reaffirms the mutual interest of Russia and Germany in dialogue.

I am moved by this chance to discuss Russian-German relations, the development of ties between my country and united Europe and international security problems here, in Berlin, a city with a difficult fate, a city which happened to become the focus of confrontation with almost the entire world on more than one occasion in the modern history of humanity, but also a city in which never, even in the darkest periods, did anyone succeed in stifling the spirit of freedom and humanism that had been nurtured way back by Wilhelm von Humboldt and Lessing.

Nor was that done in the grim years of Hitler tyranny. Our country deeply reveres the memory of heroic anti-Nazi fighters.

Russia has always had special sentiments for Germany, and regarded your country as one of the major centres of European culture – a culture, to the development of which Russia has also made a significant contribution, a culture which has known no borders and has always been our common asset and a factor of bringing peoples together.

That is why today I will take the liberty of delivering the main part of my message in the language of Goethe, Schiller and Kant, in the German language.

(Follows translation from the German.)

Distinguished ladies and gentlemen,

I have just talked about the unity of European culture. However, in the past that unity did not prevent two horrible wars from being unleashed on the continent, two world wars within one century. Nor did it prevent the building of the Berlin Wall, the formidable symbol of the deep division of Europe.

The Berlin Wall is no longer. It was destroyed. And today it would be relevant to recall why that became possible.

It is my conviction that the dramatic change in the world, in Europe and on the expanses of the former Soviet Union would have been impossible without the main preconditions, namely, without the events that took place in Russia ten years ago. These events are important to understanding what precisely took place in our country and what could be expected from Russia in the future.

The answer is simple, as a matter of fact. Under the impact of the laws governing the development of information society, Stalinist totalitarian ideology could no longer oppose the ideas of freedom and democracy. The spirit of these ideas was taking hold of the overwhelming majority of Russian citizens.

It was the political choice of the people of Russia that enabled the then leaders of the USSR to take decisions that eventually led to the razing of the Berlin Wall. It was that choice that infinitely broadened the boundaries of European humanism and that enables us to say that no one will ever be able to return Russia back into the past.

As for European integration, we not just support these processes, but we are looking to them with hope. We view them as a people who have learned the lesson of the Cold War and the peril of the ideology of occupation very well. But here, I think, it would be pertinent to add that Europe did not gain from that division either.

It is my firm conviction that in today's rapidly changing world, in a world witnessing truly dramatic demographic changes and an exceptionally high economic growth in some regions, Europe also has an immediate interest in promoting relations with Russia.

No one calls in question the great value of Europe's relations with the United States. I am just of the opinion that Europe will reinforce its reputation of a strong and truly independent centre of world politics soundly and for a long time if it succeeds in bringing together its own potential and that of Russia, including its human, territorial and natural resources and its economic, cultural and defence potential.

Together we have already taken the first steps in that direction. The time has now come to think about what should be done to make sure that a united and secure Europe becomes the harbinger of a united and secure world.

Distinguished ladies and gentlemen,

We have done a great deal in the security sphere over the past few years. The security system that we have built over the previous decades has been improved. One of the achievements of the past decade is the unprecedentedly low concentration of armed forces and armaments in Central Europe and the Baltic. Russia is a friendly European nation. Stable peace on the continent is a paramount goal for our country, which lived through a century of military catastrophes.

As everyone knows, we have ratified the Comprehensive Nuclear Tests Ban Treaty, the Nuclear Non-proliferation Treaty, the Biological Weapons Convention, and also the START-2 Treaty. Regrettably, not all the NATO countries have followed our example.

But once we, distinguished ladies and gentlemen, have started to discuss security, we should first and foremost understand from whom we are to defend ourselves, and how. In this context I cannot but mention the catastrophe in the United States on September 11. People the world over keep asking how that could have happened and who is to blame. I will give you answers to these questions.

I think we all are to blame for what happened, and first and foremost we, politicians, to whom the ordinary citizens of our nations have entrusted their security. And this happens first and foremost because we have so far failed to recognize the changes that have happened in our world over the past ten years and continue to live in the old system of values: we are talking about partnership, but in reality we have not yet learned to trust each other.

In spite of a plethora of sweet words, we are still surreptitiously opposed to each other. Now we demand loyalty to NATO, now argue about the rationale behind its enlargement. And we are still unable to agree on the problems of a missile defence system.

Over long decades of the 20th century the world was indeed living under conditions of confrontation between the two systems, confrontation that pushed humanity to the brink of annihilation on more than one occasion.

That was so fearsome and we grew so accustomed to live with that anticipation of catastrophe that we are still unable to understand and appreciate the changes taking place in today's world. We seem to be missing the fact that the world is no longer divided into two hostile camps.

The world has become far more complex, distinguished ladies and gentlemen.

We do not want or are unable to understand that the security structure built over the previous decades that was effective in neutralizing former threats is no longer able to cope with new threats of today. Too often we continue to argue over issues which we think are still important. They probably still are.

But at the same time we do not recognize new real threats and turn out to be unable to foresee terrorist attacks – and so ruthless terrorist attacks at that!

Hundreds of innocent civilians died in the bombing of residential houses in Moscow and other large Russian cities. Religious fanatics, having captured power in Chechnya and having turned ordinary citizens into their hostages, mounted a brazen large-scale armed attack against the neighboring Republic of Daghestan. International terrorists have openly – quite openly – declared their intention to establish a fundamentalist state on the territory between the Black and the Caspian Sea – the so-called khalifate, or the United States of Islam.

I would like to stress right away that talking about any ”war between civilizations“ is inadmissible. It would be a mistake to put the equation mark between Moslems in general and religious fanatics. In our country, for example, the defeat of the aggressors in 1999 was predetermined by the courageous and tough rebuff of the residents of Daghestan, a Russian republic the population of which is virtually 100 percent Moslem.

Shortly before my departure for Berlin I met with the religious leaders of Russia's Moslems. They came up with the initiative of convening an international conference on ”Islam Against Terrorism“ in Moscow. I think we should support this initiative.

Today we are coming up against not so much the aggravation of the well-known international problems as the rise of new threats. Russia is taking practical steps to put up, together with some CIS nations, a real barrier in the way of the traffic of drugs, organized crime and fundamentalism from Afghanistan via Central Asia and the Caucasus into Europe. Terrorism, national intolerance, separatism and religious extremism everywhere have the same roots and bear the same poisonous fruit. That is why the methods of fighting these problems should be universal as well.

But first agreement needs to be reached on the fundamental matter: we should not be afraid of calling a spade a spade. And it is extremely important to understand that evil deeds cannot be used to achieve political objectives, however noble such objectives may seem.

Naturally, evil must be punished, and I agree with that. But we should also understand that no retaliatory strikes will replace comprehensive, purposeful and well-coordinated struggle against terrorism. I absolutely agree with the US President on that.

I think our partners' readiness to joint efforts in countering real rather than illusory threats will demonstrate how serious and reliable they are as partners. These threats are quite capable of spilling over from the distant frontiers of our continent to the very heart of Europe. I talked about that on more than one occasion, but after what happened in the US there is no need to prove anything.

But what are we lacking today for cooperation to be efficient?

In spite of all the positive achievements of the past decades, we have not yet developed an efficient mechanism for working together.

The coordinating agencies set up so far do not offer Russia real opportunities for taking part in drafting and taking decision. Today decisions are often taken, in principle, without our participation, and we are only urged afterwards to support such decisions. After that they talk again about loyalty to NATO. They even say that such decisions cannot be implemented without Russia. Let us ask ourselves: is this normal? Is this true partnership?

Yes, the assertion of democratic principles in international relations, the ability to find a correct decision and readiness for compromise are a difficult thing. But then, it was the Europeans who were the first to understand how important it is to look for consensus over and above national egoism. We agree with that! All these are good ideas. However, the quality of decisions that are taken, their efficiency and, ultimately, European and international security in general depend on the extent to which we succeed today in translating these obvious principles into practical politics.

It seemed just recently that a truly common home would shortly rise on the continent, a home in which the Europeans would not be divided into eastern or western, northern or southern. However, these divides will remain, primarily because we have never fully shed many of the Cold War stereotypes and cliches.

Today we must say once and for all: the Cold War is done with! We have entered a new stage of development. We understand that without a modern, sound and sustainable security architecture we will never be able to create an atmosphere of trust on the continent, and without that atmosphere of trust there can be no united Greater Europe! Today we must say that we renounce our stereotypes and ambitions and from now on will jointly work for the security of the people of Europe and the world as a whole.

Dear friends,

Today, thank God, Russia is talked about in Europe not only in the context of oligarchs, corruption and Mafia. However, there still is a substantial lack of objective information about Russia. I can say with absolute confidence that the key goal of Russia's domestic policy is first and foremost to ensure democratic rights and freedoms, decent living standards and safety for the people of the country.

However, distinguished colleagues, let us look back at some events of the recent past. Russia took the painful road of reform. The scope of the tasks we had to address is without parallel in history. Naturally, mistakes were made. Not all the problems have been resolved, but today Russia is a quite dynamic part of the European continent. Moreover, it is dynamic not only politically, but also economically, which is especially encouraging. Political stability in Russia is ensured by a number of economic factors, not the least by one of the world's most liberal taxation systems. Our income tax is 13% and profit tax 24%, and this is real. Last year our economic growth was 8%. This year we expected to get just 4%, but most likely we will have about 6% — say, 5.5–5.7%. We will wait and see.

At the same time my conviction is that only large-scale and equal pan-European cooperation will make it possible to achieve qualitative progress in resolving such problems as unemployment, environmental pollution and many others.

We are set on close trade and economic cooperation. In the nearest future we intend to join the World Trade Organization. We count on international and European organizations' support for our bid.

I would like to draw your attention to things which you as members of parliament will undoubtedly be able to appreciate better and which cannot be dismissed as propaganda. As a matter of fact, our nation has gone through a revision of priorities and values.

Spending on social needs tops the 2002 consolidated budget. And I would like to stress specifically that for the first time in Russia's history spending on education has exceeded defence expenditures.

Distinguished colleagues,

Permit me to say a couple words about Russian-German relations. I would like to dwell separately on this matter. Russian-German relations are as old as our nations. The first German tribes appeared on Russian territory in the late first century. In the late 19th century Germans were the ninth most numerous ethnic group in Russia. But what is important is not just the numbers, but the role played by these people in the development of the country and in Russian-German relations. They were peasants and merchants, intellectuals, military men and politicians.

The German historian Michael Stuermer observed: ”Russia and America are divided by oceans, while Russia and Germany are divided by a great history.“ I would say that history, just like oceans, not only divides, but also unites. The important thing is to correctly interpret this history.

As a good neighbor in the West, Germany often symbolized for the Russians Europe, European culture, technical intellect and entrepreneurial wit. Small wonder that in the past all Europeans were known as Germans in Russia, and the Europeans' settlement in Moscow was known as the German Village.

Naturally, the cultural influences of the two peoples were reciprocal. Many generations of Germans and Russians studied and continue to enjoy works by Goethe, Dostoyevsky and Leo Tolstoy. Our peoples understand each other's mentality very well, as is amply evidenced by the marvelous Russian translations of German authors. They closely replicate the text and keep the pace of the narration and the mood and beauty of the original. One example is the translation of Doctor Faustus by Boris Pasternak.

Ladies and gentlemen,

There are different pages in our history, some of them rather painful, especially those relating to the 20th century. But in the past we often acted as allies.

The relations between the two European nations were every now and then reinforced by marital unions between dynasties.

Generally, women had a special role to play in our history. let us recall, for example, the daughter of the Grand Duke Ludwig IV of Hessen-Darmstadt, known in Russia as Princess Elizabeth. Following the assassination of her husband, she founded a nunnery, and during World War I she nursed wounded soldiers, both Russians and Germans. In 1918 she was executed by the Bolsheviks, but recently she was rehabilitated and sanctified for everyone to honor. A monument to her stands in the heart of Moscow today. Nor should we forget Princess Sophia Augusta Frederika of Anhalt-Zerbst, who made a unique contribution to Russian history. Ordinary Russians called her Mother, but she went down in history as Russian Empress Catherine the Great.

Today's Germany is Russia's leading economic partner, our most important creditor, one of the principal investors and a key interlocutor in discussing international politics.

I will give you one example: last year trade between our countries hit an all-time record of 41.5 billion marks. This compares with the Soviet Union's aggregate trade with both German states. Can we be happy with this and sit back and relax? I don't think so. Russian-German cooperation still has sufficient potentialities for development.

I am convinced that today we are turning over a new page in our bilateral relations, thereby making our joint contribution to building a common European home.

In conclusion I would like to say the words that were once used to characterize Germany and its capital. I would like to apply this idea to Russia and say: of course, we are at the beginning of the road to building a democratic society and a market economy. There are barriers and obstacles on that road that we are to surmount. However, if we leave aside objective problems and occasional ineptness of our own, we will see the beat of Russia's strong, live heart. And this heart is open to true cooperation and partnership.",President,Vladimir Putin,http://en.kremlin.ru/events/president/transcripts/statements/21340,,INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS
United Kingdom,10-Sep-16,Theresa May,I'll give every child a chance: article by Theresa May,"Yesterday I laid out the first step of an ambitious plan to set Britain on the path to being the great meritocracy of the world. It is a vision of a Britain where advantage is based on merit not privilege, talent not circumstance, hard work not background. It is a vision of a country where everyone plays by the same rules and ordinary, working class people have more control over their lives. A vision of a society where everyone has a fair chance to go as far as their talent and their hard work will allow. And the plan I laid out yesterday, a good school place for every child that caters to their individual talents, abilities and needs, is the starting point: putting government firmly at the service of ordinary working class people and building a great meritocracy in our nation. That means committing to the task of spreading opportunity, because when people lose a sense of opportunity they lose a sense of hope. So the changes I outlined to our school system yesterday – not just more school places but more good school places, not just more new schools but more good new schools catering to the needs and abilities of each individual child – are designed to spread opportunity across society. Because at the moment, opportunity is too often the preserve of the wealthy or a quirk of circumstance. Those who can afford to can move near a good school, pay to go private or fund the extra tuition their child needs to succeed. Those with the right connections and contacts can get on, while those who have none simply cannot. I want to correct this manifest unfairness. Giving every child the chance of a good education that’s right for them is the place to start. To do this, to deliver a good school place for every child, we will need to think differently. We will encourage and help our universities, faith groups such as the Catholic Church and independent schools to establish, sponsor or support new state schools. And yes, we will change the rules to allow for a new generation of grammar schools where there is demand and on the condition they act to raise outcomes for all pupils, particularly those from lower income households. These ‘new grammars’ are important, because at the moment selection exists if you’re wealthy but doesn’t exist if you’re not. I want to change that. I know I was incredibly lucky when I was a young girl growing up. My education was varied: I went to a grammar school that became a comprehensive, and for a short time I attended a private school. I know too that my teachers made me the woman I am today. I want every child to have the kind of opportunities that I enjoyed. I want every parent to have the peace of mind that comes with knowing their children will get the chance to go a great school. And I want every teacher and every school to have the resources and the capacity to deliver on those promises. I know these things will not just happen overnight. They require bold decisions and a lot of hard work, and no doubt there will be opposition to overcome. But as I set out yesterday, I am determined that we will build a school system that works for everyone. That is a hallmark of a truly meritocratic Britain.

USA,04-10-2017 00:00,Donald Trump,Remarks by President Trump to Civilian Heroes and Law Enforcement Officials,"THE PRESIDENT: Thank you very much, Governor. And we really appreciate that. And I will tell you, the people of Nevada and the extraordinary city have shown the world their incredible character, courage, and resolve. Nevada really is a very, very special place.

I’m honored to be here today at the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department in the company of heroes. Thank you to our police, our firefighters, and to our first responders, and of course to Sheriff Lombardo. Incredible job you’ve done.

Mayor Goodman — hello, Mayor Goodman. Senator Heller, thank you very much. Senator Cortez Masto. Majority Leader. Where is Kevin — Majority Leader? Kevin McCarthy. Adam Laxalt. All of the great congressmen that we have with us today from both parties, we just are very honored that you could be with us.

And on behalf of a grateful nation, Melania and I thank each and every one of you in law enforcement. In the depths of horror, we will always find hope in the men and women who risk their lives for ours. The mass murder that took place on Sunday night fills America’s heart with grief. America is truly a nation in mourning.

I visited the hospital earlier today where many victims are still recovering from their wounds, and we ask God to ease their suffering and to speed their healing. We pray for the recovery of the injured and those injured officers who so bravely threw themselves into danger when duty called. And we grieve the loss of the law enforcement personnel who were killed in this vicious attack.

Many families tonight will go to bed in a world that is suddenly empty. The people they so dearly love were torn away from them forever.

Our souls are stricken with grief for every American who lost a husband or a wife, a mother or a father, a son or a daughter. We know that your sorrow feels endless. We stand together to help you carry your pain. You’re not alone. We will never leave your side.

Here at the police department, we remember one of our own who died this week, Charles Hartfield. He was a very, very special person. Officer Hartfield was a proud veteran, a devoted husband, a loving father. His death is a tragic loss for this police force, for this city, and for our great nation.

We struggle for the words to explain to our children how such evil can exist, how there can be such cruelty and such suffering. But we cannot be defined by the evil that threatens us, or the violence that incites such terror.

We’re defined by our love, our caring, and our courage. In the darkest moments, what shines most brightly is the goodness that thrives in the hearts of our people. That goodness is our lighthouse. And our solace is knowledge that the souls of those who passed are now at peace in Heaven.

Here on Earth, we are blessed to be surrounded by heroes. As one eyewitness recounted this week: “While everyone else was crouching, police officers were standing up as targets, just trying to direct people and tell them where to go.” The officers were standing up in the line of fire to help those in danger and to find out where those horrible shots were coming from.

Words cannot describe the bravery that the whole world witnessed on Sunday night. Americans defied death and hatred with love and with courage. When the word — and the worst of humanity strikes — and strike it did — the best of humanity responds.

Parents and spouses used their own bodies as shields to protect their loved ones. Americans dashed into a hail of bullets to rescue total strangers.

Joining us today are many of the heroes who were here during that horrible moment, that horrible night, including Las Vegas Metropolitan Police officers Tyler Peterson and Tana Gurule, and civilian Aaron Stalker.

Officer Peterson was on his second day on the job when the shooting began. I just visited with him in the hospital. Within minutes, he joined a group of officers rushing between flying bullets to clear the fairground and save lives.

Officer Gurule was off-duty attending the concert. Although she was unarmed, as soon as the shooting began, she threw on a yellow police vest and began evacuating victims.

And Aaron Stalker, a veteran, rushed to the scene to search for his loved ones, but when he couldn’t find them, he began helping every person he could. As he recounts: “We used the plastic barriers as gurneys to carry the injured to transportation. I made splints out of whatever I could find and used anything to stop the horrible bleeding.”

Among the wounded was the mother of Aaron’s girlfriend. She is still in the hospital, and we are all pulling for her.

To every hero we [who] helped — every hero saved so many lives. And believe me, a grateful nation thanks you. The example of those whose final act was to sacrifice themselves for those they loved should inspire all of us to show more love every day for the people who grace our lives.

In the months ahead, we will all have to wrestle with the horror of what has unfolded this week, but we will struggle through it together. We will endure the pain together. And we will overcome together as Americans.

May God bless and watch over those who protect us. May God bring healing to the families of the wounded, the injured, and the fallen. And may God bless our great country, America. Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you, Governor.

USA,22-03-2014,Barack Obama,"
Weekly Address: Rewarding Women's Hard Work and Increasing the Minimum Wage"," Hi, everybody.  This week, I visited a community college in Florida, where I spoke with students about what we need to do to make sure our economy rewards the hard work of every American.

More specifically, I spoke about making sure our economy rewards the hard work of women. 

Today, women make up about half of our workforce, and more than half of our college graduates.  More women are now their families’ main breadwinner than ever before. 

But in a lot of ways, our economy hasn’t caught up to this new reality yet.  On average, a woman still earns just 77 cents for every dollar a man does.  And too many women face outdated workplace policies that hold them back – which in turn holds back our families and our entire economy.

A woman deserves to earn equal pay for equal work, and paid leave that lets you take a day off to care for a sick child or parent.  Congress needs to act on these priorities. 

And when women hold most lower-wage jobs in America, Congress needs to raise the minimum wage.  Because no woman who works full-time should ever have to raise her children in poverty.

Now, the good news is that in the year since I first called on Congress to raise the minimum wage, six states have passed laws to raise theirs.  More states, counties, and cities are working to raise their minimum wages as we speak.  Small businesses like St. Louis-based Pi Pizzeria, are raising their wages too – not out of charity, but because it’s good for business.  And by the way, Pi makes a really good pizza.  And in this year of action, I signed an executive order requiring federal contractors to pay their employees a fair wage of at least ten dollars and ten cents an hour. 

But if we’re truly going to reward the hard work of every American, Congress needs to join the rest of the country and pass a bill that would lift the federal minimum wage to ten dollars and ten cents an hour.  This wouldn’t just raise wages for minimum wage workers – its effects would lift wages for nearly 28 million Americans across this country.  It will give businesses more customers with more money to spend, and grow the economy for everybody.  So call up your Member of Congress and let them know it’s time for “ten-ten.”  It’s time to give America a raise. 

A true opportunity agenda is one that works for working women. Because when women succeed, America succeeds.  We do better when everyone participates, and when everyone who works hard has the chance to get ahead.  That’s what opportunity means – and it’s why I’ll keep fighting to restore it. 

Thanks, everybody, and have a great weekend. ",President,Barack Obama,https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/the-press-office/2014/03/22/weekly-address-rewarding-womens-hard-work-and-increasing-minimum-wage,,DEVELOPMENT

USA,12-01-2015,Barack Obama,"
Remarks by the President at the Federal Trade Commission","Thank you so much.  (Applause.)  Thank you. Everybody have a seat.  Well, thank you, Edith, for your introduction.  Edith and I go a long way back.  In law school we served on the law review together.  I will not say who edited who.  (Laughter.)  I will say she looks exactly the same.  (Laughter.)  And I do not.  (Laughter.)  And it's upsetting.  (Laughter.) 
 
Edith, in your career, you’ve stood up for citizens and communities.  I was proud to nominate you -- first as a commissioner, and then as chairwoman of the FTC.  You are doing an outstanding job, as are your fellow commissioners, and we very much appreciate your outstanding efforts.   

And Edith’s story, from the daughter of Mexican immigrants to the head of the FTC, we see a central part of the American story.  And that's worth remembering at a time when those are issues that we're debating all the time.  It's a reminder that what makes this country special is the incredible talent that we draw from all around the world and somehow it all merges into something unique:  America. 

To Edith, to the fellow commissioners, to all of you who work at the FTC -- thanks for welcoming me.  I’m told I may be the first President to come to the FTC in nearly 80 years, since FDR in -- (applause) -- first time apparently since FDR in 1937, which is a little surprising.  I mean, you’d think like one of the Presidents would just come here by accident.  (Laughter.)  They ended up in the wrong building, we're already at the FTC.  (Laughter.) 

Anyway, I figured it was time to correct that.  Plus, I know sometimes your name confuses folks.  They don’t always understand what your mission is.  One person who does understand is David Letterman.  (Laughter.)  A few months ago he thanked you for standing up to the companies that were trying to pitch a new weight-loss product -- “caffeine-laced undergarments.”  (Laughter.)  I’m actually not making this up.  (Laughter.)  You ruled that these products were “not substantiated by scientific evidence.”  (Laughter.)  So, thank you for saving America from caffeine-laced undergarments.  (Laughter.)  These companies owed consumers a refund. 

And that was just the latest example, because, as Edith said, you recently celebrated your 100th anniversary.  And I want to thank you for 100 proud years of protecting American consumers.  I also want to thank some of the members of Congress who are here today and many of our partners from not just government but the private sector, and consumer and privacy and advocacy groups. 

Next week, just up the street, I will deliver the State of the Union address.  And it will be a chance to talk about America’s resurgence, including something we can all be proud of, which is the longest stretch of private sector job growth in American history -- 58 straight months and more than 11 million new jobs.  (Applause.)  In the speech, I’m going to focus on how we can build on that progress and help more Americans feel that resurgence in their own lives, through higher wages and rising incomes and a growing middle class. 

But since I’ve only got two years left in this job, I tend to be impatient and I didn’t want to wait for the State of the Union to start sharing my plans.  So I’ve been traveling across the country rolling out some of the ideas that we’ll be talking about, a little bit of a sneak preview. 

And in the 21st century -- in this dizzying age of technology and innovation -- so much of the prosperity that we seek, so many of the jobs that we create, so much of the opportunity that’s available for the next generation depends on our digital economy.  It depends on our ability to search and connect and shop and do business and create and discover and learn online, in cyberspace.  And as we’ve all been reminded over the past year, including the hack of Sony, this extraordinary interconnection creates enormous opportunities, but also creates enormous vulnerabilities for us as a nation and for our economy, and for individual families.  

So this week, I’m laying out some new proposals on how we can keep seizing the possibilities of an Information Age, while protecting the security and prosperity and values that we all cherish.  Today, I’m focusing on how we can better protect American consumers from identity theft and ensure our privacy, including for our children at school.  And then tomorrow, at the Department of Homeland Security, I’ll focus on how we can work with the private sector to better defend ourselves against cyber-attacks.  And final, on Wednesday, in Iowa, I’ll talk about how we can give families and communities faster, cheaper access to broadband so they can succeed in the digital economy.

But I wanted to start here, at the FTC, because every day you take the lead in making sure that Americans, their hard-earned money and their privacy are protected, especially when they go online.  And these days, that’s pretty much for everything:  managing our bank accounts, paying our bills, handling everything from medical records to movie tickets, controlling our homes -- smart houses, from smart phones.  Secret Service does not let me do that.  (Laughter.)  But I know other people do. 

And with these benefits come risks -- major companies get hacked; America’s personal information, including financial information, gets stolen.  And the problem is growing, and it costs us billions of dollars.  In one survey, 9 out of 10 Americans say they feel like they’ve lost control of their personal information.  In recent breaches, more than 100 million Americans have had their personal data compromised, like credit card information.  When these cyber criminals start racking up charges on your card, it can destroy your credit rating.  It can turn your life upside down.  It may take you months to get your finances back in order.  So this is a direct threat to the economic security of American families and we’ve got to stop it.

If we’re going to be connected, then we need to be protected.  As Americans, we shouldn’t have to forfeit our basic privacy when we go online to do our business.  And that’s why, since I took office, we’ve been working with the private sector to strengthen our cyber defenses.  A few months ago, we launched our BuySecure initiative.  The federal government and companies across the country are moving to stronger chip-and-pin technology for credit cards.   Here at the FTC, you’re working with credit bureaus so that victims can recover their stolen identities faster, and every day you’re helping consumers with IdentityTheft.gov

So today I’m announcing new steps to protect the identities and privacy of the American people.  Let me list them for you.  First, we’re introducing new legislation to create a single, strong national standard so Americans know when their information has been stolen or misused.  Right now, almost every state has a different law on this, and it’s confusing for consumers and it’s confusing for companies -- and it’s costly, too, to have to comply to this patchwork of laws.  Sometimes, folks don’t even find out their credit card information has been stolen until they see charges on their bill, and then it’s too late.  So under the new standard that we’re proposing, companies would have to notify consumers of a breach within 30 days.  In addition, we’re proposing to close loopholes in the law so we can go after more criminals who steal and sell the identities of Americans —- even when they do it overseas. 

Second, I’m pleased that more banks, credit card issuers and lenders are stepping up and equipping Americans with another weapon against identity theft, and that’s access to their credit scores, free of charge.  This includes JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, USAA, State Employees’ Credit Union, Ally Financial.  Some of them are here today.  I want to thank them for their participation.  This means that a majority of American adults will have free access to their credit score, which is like an early warning system telling you that you’ve been hit by fraud so you can deal with it fast.  And we’re encouraging more companies to join this effort every day.

Third, we’re going to be introducing new legislation -— a Consumer Privacy Bill of Rights.  Working with many of you -— from the private sector and advocacy groups -- we’ve identified some basic principles to both protect personal privacy and ensure that industry can keep innovating.  For example, we believe that consumers have the right to decide what personal data companies collect from them and how companies use that data, that information; the right to know that your personal information collected for one purpose can’t then be misused by a company for a different purpose; the right to have your information stored securely by companies that are accountable for its use.  We believe that there ought to be some basic baseline protections across industries.  So we're going to be introducing this legislation by the end of next month, and I hope Congress joins us to make the Consumer Privacy Bill of Rights the law of the land. 

And finally, we’re taking a series of actions to protect the personal information and privacy of our children.  Those of us with kids know how hard this can be.  Whether they are texting or tweeting, or on Facebook, or Instagram, or Vine, our children are meeting up -- and they are growing up -- in cyberspace.  It is all-pervasive.  And here at the FTC, you’ve pushed back on companies and apps that collect information on our kids without permission. 

And Michelle and I are like parents everywhere -- we want to make sure that our children are being smart and safe online.  That's a responsibility of ours as parents.  But we need partners.  And we need a structure that ensures that information is not being gathered without us as parents or the kids knowing it.  We want our kids’ privacy protected -— wherever they sign in or log on, including at school.

Now, the good news is we’ve got new educational technologies that are transforming how our children learn.  You've got innovative websites and apps and tablets, digital textbooks and tutors.  Students are getting lessons tailored to their unique learning needs.  We want to encourage that information.  And it also facilitates teachers and parents tracking student progress and grades in real-time.  And all this is part of what our ConnectED initiative is about -— connecting 99 percent of American students to high-speed Internet so that we’re empowering students, teachers, and parents, and giving them access to worlds they may never have had access to before.

But we’ve already seen some instances where some companies use educational technologies to collect student data for commercial purposes, like targeted advertising.  And parents have a legitimate concern about those kinds of practices.

So, today, we’re proposing the Student Digital Privacy Act. That's pretty straightforward.  We’re saying that data collected on students in the classroom should only be used for educational purposes -— to teach our children, not to market to our children. We want to prevent companies from selling student data to third parties for purposes other than education.  We want to prevent any kind of profiling that outs certain students at a disadvantage as they go through school.

And we believe that this won’t just give parents more peace of mind.  We're confident that it will make sure the tools we use in the classroom will actually support the breakthrough research and innovations that we need to keep unlocking new educational technologies.

Now, we didn't have to completely reinvent the wheel on this proposal.  Many states have proposed similar legislation.  California just passed a landmark law.  And I hope Congress joins us in this national movement to protect the privacy of our children.

We won’t wait for legislation, though.  The Department of Education is going to offer new tools to help schools and teachers work with tech companies to protect the privacy of students.  As of today, 75 companies across the country have signed on to a Student Privacy Pledge.  And among other things, they’re committing not to sell student information or use educational technologies to engage in targeted advertising to students. 

Some of those companies are here today.  We want to thank you for your leadership.  I want to encourage every company that provides these technologies to our schools to join this effort.  It’s the right thing to do.  And if you don’t join this effort, then we intend to make sure that those schools and those parents know you haven’t joined this effort.

So, this mission, protecting our information and privacy in the Information Age, this should not be a partisan issue.  This should be something that unites all of us as Americans.  It’s one of those new challenges in our modern society that crosses the old divides -- transcends politics, transcends ideology.  Liberal, conservative, Democrat, Republican, everybody is online, and everybody understands the risks and vulnerabilities as well as opportunities that are presented by this new world. 

Business leaders want their privacy and their children’s privacy protected, just like everybody else does.  Consumer and privacy advocates also want to make sure that America keeps leading the world in technology and innovation and apps.  So there are some basic, common-sense, pragmatic steps that we ought to all be able to support. 

And rather than being at odds, I think that much of this work actually reinforces each other.  The more we do to protect consumer information and privacy, the harder it is for hackers to damage our businesses and hurt our economy.  Meanwhile, the more companies strengthen their cybersecurity, the harder it is for hackers to steal consumer information and hurt American families. So we’ve got to all be working together in the same direction, and I'm confident if we do we’ll be making progress.

We are the country that invented the Internet.  And we’re also the pioneers of this Information Age -- the creators, the designers, the innovators.  Our children are leaving us in the dust, if you haven’t noticed. (Laughter.)  They’re connecting and they’re collaborating like never before, and imagining a future we can only dream of.  When we Americans put our minds together and our shoulder to the wheel, there’s nothing we can’t do.  So I’m confident, if we keep at this, we can deliver the prosperity and security and privacy that all Americans deserve.

We pioneered the Internet, but we also pioneered the Bill of Rights, and a sense that each of us as individuals have a sphere of privacy around us that should not be breached, whether by our government, but also by commercial interests.  And since we’re pioneers in both these areas, I'm confident that we can be pioneers in crafting the kind of architecture that will allow us to both grow, innovate, and preserve those values that are so precious to us as Americans.

Thank you very much.  And thanks to the FTC -- (applause) -- for all the great work you do to protect the American people.  Thank you.  (Applause.) ",President,Barack Obama,https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/the-press-office/2015/01/12/remarks-president-federal-trade-commission,,DEVELOPMENT

This is a promising development in our fight against the virus. If you are a parent who wants to protect your child, or a teenager who is interested in getting vaccinated, today’s decision is a step closer to that goal.

Millions of 16- and 17-year-olds have been safely vaccinated, and as more and more Americans get vaccinated, COVID-19 cases, hospitalizations, and deaths continue to fall. The safe and effective vaccines are curbing the spread of the virus, saving thousands of lives, and allowing millions of Americans to start returning to a closer to normal life.

In the coming days, we will hear more from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) on its recommendations. I look forward to speaking more about what today’s news means for our vaccination program, but the bottom line is: The light at the end of the tunnel is growing, and today it got a little brighter.",President,Joe Biden,https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/05/10/statement-by-president-biden-on-fdas-expanded-emergency-use-authorization-of-the-pfizer-biontech-covid-19-vaccine-to-include-adolescents/,,DEVELOPMENT
USA,07-11-2021 00:00,Joe Biden,"Statement by President Joseph R. Biden, Jr. on Nicaragua’s Sham Elections","What Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega and his wife, Vice President Rosario Murillo, orchestrated today was a pantomime election that was neither free nor fair, and most certainly not democratic.  The arbitrary imprisonment of nearly 40 opposition figures since May, including seven potential presidential candidates, and the blocking of political parties from participation rigged the outcome well before election day.  They shuttered independent media, locked up journalists and members of the private sector, and bullied civil society organizations into closing their doors.  Long unpopular and now without a democratic mandate, the Ortega and Murillo family now rule Nicaragua as autocrats, no different from the Somoza family that Ortega and the Sandinistas fought four decades ago. 

The United States stands in support of the inalienable right to democratic self-determination of the Nicaraguan people, and those of any other country in the hemisphere where popular sovereignty is compromised by the erosion of democratic norms, stifling of civic space, or violations of fundamental rights. The Inter-American Democratic Charter obligates the hemisphere to stand up for the democratic rights of the Nicaraguan people. We call on the Ortega-Murillo regime to take immediate steps to restore democracy in Nicaragua, and to  immediately and unconditionally release those unjustly imprisoned for speaking out against abuses and clamoring for the right of Nicaraguans to vote in free and fair elections. Until then, the United States, in close coordination with other members of the international community, will use all diplomatic and economic tools at our disposal to support the people of Nicaragua and hold accountable the Ortega-Murillo government and those that facilitate its abuses.",President,Joe Biden,https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/11/07/statement-by-president-joseph-r-biden-jr-on-nicaraguas-sham-elections/,,INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS
USA,12-04-2014,Barack Obama,"
Weekly Address: Ensuring Equal Pay for Equal Work"," Hi, everybody.  Earlier this week was Equal Pay Day.  It marks the extra time the average woman has to work into a new year to earn what a man earned the year before.  You see, the average woman who works full-time in America earns less than a man – even when she’s in the same profession and has the same education. 

That's wrong.  In 2014, it’s an embarrassment. Women deserve equal pay for equal work.

This is an economic issue that affects all of us.  Women make up about half our workforce.  And more and more, they’re our families’ main breadwinners.  So it’s good for everyone when women are paid fairly.  That’s why, this week, I took action to prohibit more businesses from punishing workers who discuss their salaries – because more pay transparency makes it easier to spot pay discrimination.  And I hope more business leaders will take up this cause.

But equal pay is just one part of an economic agenda for women.

Most lower-wage workers in America are women.  So I’ve taken executive action to require federal contractors to pay their federally-funded employees at least ten dollars and ten cents an hour.  I ordered a review of our nation’s overtime rules, to give more workers the chance to earn the overtime pay they deserve.  Thanks to the Affordable Care Act, tens of millions of women are now guaranteed free preventive care like mammograms and contraceptive care, and the days when you could be charged more just for being a woman are over for good.  Across the country, we’re bringing Americans together to help us make sure that a woman can have a baby without sacrificing her job, or take a day off to care for a sick child or parent without hitting hardship.  It’s time to do away with workplace policies that belong in a “Mad Men” episode, and give every woman the opportunity she deserves.

Here’s the problem, though.  On issues that would benefit millions of women, Republicans in Congress have blocked progress at every turn. Just this week, Senate Republicans blocked the Paycheck Fairness Act, commonsense legislation that would help more women win equal pay for equal work.  House Republicans won’t vote to raise the minimum wage or extend unemployment insurance for women out of work through no fault of their own.  The budget they passed this week would force deep cuts to investments that overwhelmingly benefit women and children – like Medicaid, food stamps, and college grants.  And of course, they’re trying to repeal the Affordable Care Act for the fiftieth or so time, which would take away vital benefits and protections from millions of women.

I’m going to keep fighting to make sure that doesn’t happen.  Because we do better when our economy grows for everybody, not just a few.  And when women succeed, America succeeds.  Thanks, and have a great weekend.",President,Barack Obama,https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/the-press-office/2014/04/12/weekly-address-ensuring-equal-pay-equal-work,,DEVELOPMENT
Russia,21-11-2007,Vladimir Putin,Speech to a Gathering of the Supporters of the President of Russia,"Dear friends!

First of all I would like to express my gratitude to all those who have come here today, and to all those who are not here, but who are working for a common goal: for the victory of United Russia in the elections to the State Duma on December 2 of this year.

Representatives from all regions of the country are here, people of different ages, occupations and beliefs. We have come together to support United Russia.

The importance of the December 2nd elections to the State Duma for the future of the country is absolutely obvious. This is not only because the new parliament will have to do its work during a crucial period for Russia’s recovery, years when the largest projects we have identified in recent years will have to be implemented.

The vital importance of these elections is also bound up with the fact that they are taking place a few months before the election of the new Russian Head of State. And if we win in December, then we will win the presidential election in March of next year.

Dear friends! For this renewal — just think of it, in the next few months there will be a complete renewal in Russia at the highest levels of government – for this renewal to take place the way it should, for this process to succeed, for it to benefit the country, for it to create a new parliament and a president that can work effectively with each other and work for the benefit of all citizens of Russia, all we have to do is win.

We have to do everything possible to face our biggest challenge.

What is it? What is our biggest challenge?

It’s the necessity of maintaining the momentum of stable, sustainable development in our country. And we have to protect the prosperity and security of our Fatherland.

Dear friends!

As you know (and you must know this), I have never been directly involved in a political campaign of this kind before. Of course you could say that the business of the President necessarily involves publicity. But this results, as it should, from the performance of specific tasks, the execution of official duties, and is not normally related to political advertising, which, frankly, I do not always like. And let us also say openly that United Russia itself is not yet an ideal political tool. We have a lot to do to make it work better.

Nevertheless, I agreed to head the United Russia party list. I did this deliberately. I believe that in this way I can help form a competent and reputable legislature.

I believe we have no right to allow the State Duma to become a mob of populists, paralyzed by corruption and demagoguery. We have to prevent what happened before in our country from taking place again.

I repeat: the country needs, not a populist parliament, but a responsible one, working in the interests of all its citizens. And that is why United Russia, with your support, must win a majority in the State Duma.

We need this in order to make full use of the constitutional powers of the Federal Assembly, to take an active part in shaping the future policy of the government, the Central Bank, the judiciary and the regional authorities.

This is simply necessary to effectively protect our plans for strengthening Russia. Without a functioning parliament, we will not be able to ensure development in the economic sector, in science, education, health or culture.

Of course, in order to achieve the stated objectives of United Russia itself, as I just said, the party should be updated and reformed. There is a need to expand internal debates and to attract young people like you. The party itself should be flexible, resilient and responsive to public opinion.

Undoubtedly in the upcoming elections, people will express their level of confidence and support for what we have done so far. They will assess what has been and is being done, as well as our plans for the future.

Therefore, on 2 December not only do the deputies receive their new mandates but also the main issue will be addressed: whom to entrust with the implementation of plans for the development of Russia.

Dear friends, we have done a lot together. We have strengthened Russia’s sovereignty and restored its integrity. We have restored the rule of law and the supremacy of the Constitution. Despite heavy losses and casualties, thanks to the courage and unity of the Russian people, international terrorist aggressions against our homeland have been repelled. There is still a large and difficult task ahead of us, but we have turned the tide.

Now a couple of words on the economy. The increase in gross domestic product in the last eight years has been 70 percent. The total capitalization of Russian companies has increased by a factor of 30. Just think about what that figure represents. The Russia that we have been discussing today has retaken its place as one of the top ten economies of the world. And this is just the beginning. Independent experts at home and abroad are absolutely convinced that, if the current rate of development continues, if the momentum of economic growth is maintained, within 10 years Russia will be one of the top five economies in the world. And we are determined to make this happen.

The situation in the social sphere has changed dramatically. Real wages (adjusted for inflation) have grown threefold. Thanks to an active social policy, mortality rates are declining. For the first time in recent years the birth rate is increasing. (And I am very much counting on this audience to help in this too.)

Dear friends! We have fully settled our foreign debts. This is important. We have accumulated significant material and financial resources. Now we are able to use the additional hundreds of billions of rubles to raise pensions and wages, to restructure our industry in innovative ways, and to improve science, education and health care.

Much of the money will go to the construction of roads and resettlement of people currently living in dilapidated housing, and simply for housing, including housing for young families. And, of course, to strengthen our armed forces.

That is the plan we have worked out. All these and many other programmes are scheduled for years into the future. And, I repeat, we have the resources for their implementation.

But if everything on this schedule is not to drown in populist chitchat, we have to win the election.

And now, dear friends, I want to say something to you, to those who are gathered in this room, and to all the citizens of the country. I want to warn you: nothing has been decided once and for all. Social stability, economic recovery, even peace in our land, the admittedly modest, but clear rise in living standards – all these things haven’t fallen from the sky. And unfortunately there is as yet no means by which such things can be unconditionally, automatically assured. This is the result of constant, sometimes bitter, tough political struggle, both domestically and internationally, a conflict of interests. Both you and the whole Russian people must involve yourselves in this struggle.

Those who oppose us do not want to implement our plan. Because they have other plans and a different view of Russia. They need a weak nation, a sick nation. They need a disorganized and disoriented society, a divided society, so that they can covertly work out their deals and receive their reward at our expense. And, unfortunately, we still have people in the country who live by begging at foreign embassies and foreign diplomatic missions. They count on the support of foreign funds and governments, rather than the support of their own people.

Of course, we are all aware of the problems. But there are those who are speculating on them. We all know about them. Many of our pensioners and veterans are still poor, undeservedly so. Villages and small towns are disproportionately lagging behind mega-cities and large industrial centres in terms of quality of life, as they were a decade ago. Our defense industry, the army and the navy need greater investment and more attention generally. The tide has turned, but terrorism has not been definitively stamped out. Corruption, drugs and organized crime are losing ground, but more slowly than one would wish. Teachers and health workers deserve higher wages.

All of this is true. The government really has made mistakes. You can and should criticize it for that. We see the problems ourselves and we are working to resolve them.

But the political speculation on these difficulties has caused at the very least some perplexity. And who is responsible for it? Those who for decades had guided Russia, and at the end of the 1980s left people without the most basic services and goods: no sugar, no meat, no salt, no matches. And of course their policies were responsible for the collapse of the Soviet Union.

There has also been speculation on the part of those who only a decade ago controlled key positions in the Federal Assembly and the government cabinet. These are the people who occupied high positions in the 90s and acted to the detriment of society and the state, served the interests of oligarchic structures and bargained away our national assets. These are the ones who are telling us how to live today, the ones who, by the way, made corruption the principal means of economic and political competition. These are the ones who year after year accepted unbalanced, totally irresponsible budgets, finally resulting in default, collapse and a precipitous fall in living standards for the citizens of our country.

Was it not these opponents of ours who contemptuously described domestic agriculture as a black hole and denied the need for state support for villages?

And it was they who in due course reduced funding for science and defense, insisting on a totally unfounded, radical reduction of our armed forces.

These are the ones who for years failed to pay child allowances, pensions and wages, who during the worst period of terrorist attacks on Russia treacherously called for negotiations, and in fact for collusion with the terrorists, with those who killed our women and children. They gambled with the lives of the victims in the most shameless and cynical way.

In short, it is all those who at the end of the last century brought mass poverty and an epidemic of corruption to Russia, something we have been fighting ever since.

And do not labour under any illusions, dear friends! All these people have not left the political scene. You will find their names among the sponsors and the candidates of a number of parties. They want to take revenge, to return to power, to regain their spheres of influence, and to gradually restore an oligarchical regime based on corruption and lies. They are lying even today. They will not do anything for anyone, including the pensioners whom they robbed repeatedly when they were in power. Now they have even taken to the streets. They have learned a little from Western specialists and have trained in neighbouring republics. Now they will organize provocations here.

Overall, I think that there can be no doubt: these gentlemen can only do one thing if returned to power, rob millions of people again, fill their pockets, and do so with their characteristic brilliance and cynicism. Of that there can be no doubt.

Today, everyone can see that Russia has accumulated vast resources. Some want to take it all away again, divide it up, and then reduce it to rock bottom. They have done this more than once in the past. Still others want to ransack and steal everything again.

Dear friends!

I appeal to you, to all like-minded people, to everyone who wants to make Russia a strong and prosperous country, a country of free and happy people, a country open to an honest dialogue with all peoples of the world.

Dear friends!

On December 2nd the fate of the country will in large measure be decided. Be sure to participate in the elections and vote for United Russia.

We need your support.

We need to continue the transformation already begun so that in every city, in every village, in every street, in every house and in the life of each Russian real changes for the better take place. So that the people in our country have confidence in the future and live in dignity. That is the life that befits the citizens of a great country.

Thank you! I am counting on you.",President,Vladimir Putin,http://en.kremlin.ru/events/president/transcripts/statements/24713,,OTHERS

Remarks by the President with Combatant Commanders and Joint Chiefs of Staff","Well, Happy New Year, everybody.  I want to begin by thanking Ash Carter, our Secretary of Defense; General Joe Dunford and Vice Chair Paul Selva, and all of our commanders here.

The purpose of this meeting -- something I do on a regular basis -- is to allow me to hear directly from those who are charged with the most solemn responsibility of maintaining the finest fighting force that the world has ever known, and keeping the American people safe.  It is in these meetings that we have been able to set broad strategy, identify areas where we have to improve, address the health of the force.  And I can say to the American people that they are extraordinarily lucky and I am extraordinarily lucky to be served by such extraordinary patriots.

This will be my last meeting with them.  And so part of my goal here is just to say thank you to them and let them know how much I appreciate the counsel, the advice, the leadership that they have consistently shown throughout my time in office.  

But in addition to saying thank you, I will get their views on the fact that we still have a lot of active threats around the world and we still have men and women in harm’s way around the world who are busy protecting our homeland and our vital interests and our allies.  And we've got to make sure that during this transition period that there is a seamless passing of the baton, that there’s continuity, and that any issues that still remain -- and obviously we still have major fights against ISIS in Mosul and in Syria; Afghanistan is still active -- that in all of these areas we are doing everything we can to make sure that the next President will benefit from the same kinds of outstanding advice and service that these people around the table have provided me.

So it has been, as I've said repeatedly, one of the greatest honors and privileges of being President serving as Commander-in-Chief to such outstanding people.  And I couldn't have done it without all of you.  And I know that my optimism about America going forward is in part because we have such an amazing military -- not only one that knows how to fight, but also knows how to uphold the values of rule of law and professionalism and integrity, and recognizes our constitutional structure and maintains strict adherence and respect for civilian authority and democratic practices in determining how we use the awesome force of the American military.

So I just want to say thank you to all of you.

And with that, we've got to do some work.  All right?  Thank you so much.  I appreciate it.",President,Barack Obama,https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/the-press-office/2017/01/04/remarks-president-combatant-commanders-and-joint-chiefs-staff,,NATIONALISM

Remarks by President Obama before Restricted Bilateral Meeting","Well, let me thank President Peña Nieto for his wonderful hospitality in hosting us here today.  And it's a special treat to be able to visit his home town of Toluca.
 
This is my fifth visit to Mexico, and I think it underscores the incredible importance of the relationship between the United States and Mexico, not only on commercial issues and security issues, but because of the intimate person-to-person relations that exist between our two countries.
 
I want to congratulate President Peña Nieto on the outstanding efforts that he’s made during the course of this year on a whole range of reforms that promise to make Mexico more competitive and increase opportunity for the people of Mexico.  And I'm also very interested in hearing President Peña Nieto’s strategies as he embarks on dealing with some of the reforms in the criminal justice system and around security issues, which I know are very pressing on his mind and where we have some excellent cooperation between the United States and Mexico.
 
More broadly, the North American Leaders Summit gives us an opportunity to build on the enormous progress that we've already made in making sure that North America is the most competitive region in the world and that we are able not only to continue to integrate our economies effectively to create jobs both in the United States, Mexico and Canada, but that we're able to project American and Mexican and Canadian goods and services around the world toward the benefit of our people.
 
And the cooperation ranges from how do we make our borders more efficient to moving forward on the Trans-Pacific Partnership that offers the opportunity to open up new markets in the fastest, most populous region of the world, the Asia Pacific region.
 
We'll also have the opportunity to discuss how we can work together more closely on scientific and educational exchanges.  We're particularly interested in making sure that young people in Mexico and the United States and Canada are able to study and travel in each country, and we're trying to expand those kinds of exchanges.
 
So this is a wonderful opportunity for us to build on the work that we've already done over the last year.
 
With the President’s indulgence, let me say one last thing, and that is about the situation in Ukraine, which obviously has captured the attention of the entire world. 
 
The United States condemns in strongest terms the violence that's taking place there.  And we have been deeply engaged with our European partners as well as both the Ukrainian government and the opposition to try to assure that that violence ends.
 
But we hold the Ukrainian government primarily responsible for making sure that it is dealing with peaceful protesters in an appropriate way; that the Ukrainian people are able to assemble and speak freely about their interests without fear of repression. 
 
And I want to be very clear that as we work through these next several days in Ukraine that we are going to be watching very carefully and we expect the Ukrainian government to show restraint, to not resort to violence in dealing with peaceful protesters.  We've said that we also expect peaceful protesters to remain peaceful.  And we'll be monitoring very carefully the situation, recognizing, along with our European partners and the international community, there will be consequences if people step over the line.  And that includes making sure that the Ukrainian military does not step into what should be a set of issues that can be resolved by civilians.
 
So the United States will continue to engage with all sides in the dispute in Ukraine, and ultimately our interest is to make sure that the Ukrainian people can express their own desires.  And we believe that a large majority of Ukrainians are interested in an integration with Europe, and the commerce and cultural exchanges that are possible for them to expand opportunity and prosperity.
 
But regardless of how the Ukrainian people determine their own future, it is important that it is the people themselves that make those decisions.  And that’s what the United States will continue to strive to achieve.
 
And I do think there is still the possibility of a peaceful transition within Ukraine, but it’s going to require the government, in particular, to actively seek that peaceful transition, and it requires the opposition and those on the streets to recognize that violence is not going to be the path by which this issue will be resolved.

Russia,30-11-2018,Vladimir Putin,BRICS leaders’ meeting,"Friends, colleagues,
I am pleased that we are meeting again and, like my colleagues, I express my gratitude to the President of South Africa, Mr Ramaphosa, for organising our work and for everything South Africa has done during its chairmanship.
I would like to join in the gratitude addressed to President of Brazil Michel Temer. He supported our organisation, and I can add that he also has done a lot to strengthen Russian-Brazilian relations. We know and remember that. Mr President, we will always be glad to see you in Russia.
Thanks to efficient cooperation between the BRICS members, our strategic partnership has grown stronger and continues to actively develop in the most diverse areas.
It is important that the BRICS members are improving coordination within international organisations and forums. Our meeting today, which is a chance to discuss our positions on the eve of the G20 summit, is a testament to that.
I support much of what my colleagues have said about the difficult situation in global politics, economy, trade and finance. I would also note such risk factors as an increase in global debt, volatility of stock markets and escalating trade disputes.
In general, we cannot help noticing that unfair competition often takes the place of fair and equitable intergovernmental dialogue. The nefarious practice of imposing unilateral sanctions and protectionist measures without regard to the UN Charter, WTO rules and other generally accepted legal norms is spreading.
All of this seriously undermines the atmosphere of cooperation on the global stage and leads to declining business ties and loss of trust between participants of economic relations, distorting the very fabric of the global economy.
The BRICS countries should continue to work together to create a fair and equitable system of international relations. Collective action based on mutual respect and consideration of interests is needed in order to overcome the critical challenges facing the international community.
First of all, this concerns the settlement of numerous regional crises, which are fraught with real danger not only for the countries involved, but for the rest of the world as well. Of particular concern is the situation in the Middle East, namely, the Gaza Strip, Yemen, Iraq, Libya, Afghanistan and several other countries and regions.
Unfortunately, the danger posed by international terrorism is not subsiding. Of course, double standards or any compromises are unacceptable when it comes to terrorist groups, not to mention making reckless use of them to achieve geopolitical ends, since flirting with terrorists plays into their hands and emboldens them to commit new bloody atrocities.
Thus, in Syria, where militants continue armed attacks on the government forces, the November 24 attack on residents of the western districts of the city of Aleppo involving the use of toxic chemical agents, presumably chlorine, was a blatant violation of the ceasefire. Dozens of Syrians were affected, including children. Such crimes perpetrated by terrorists should not go unpunished, otherwise they will not stop.
For a long-term stabilisation of the situation in Syria, it is important to promote an actual political settlement process. To this end, Russia is working closely with its partners, Iran and Turkey, within the Astana format. We look forward to the formation and convocation of the constitutional committee in Geneva as soon as possible.
Other priorities include rebuilding the economy and infrastructure in that country and creating conditions for the return of refugees to their homes. I hope that the BRICS countries will join humanitarian aid programmes in that country.
In order to prevent a new round of escalating tensions around the Iranian nuclear programme, we should do our best to maintain the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action.
Progress in resolving the Korean Peninsula crisis is a positive development. However, the categorical demands for unilateral concessions from Pyongyang could lead to a disruption of the agreements reached. Therefore, it is important that the sanctions against this country should gradually be relieved in response to the disarmament steps taken by North Korea.
Naturally, one cannot help being alarmed by the state of affairs in non-proliferation and disarmament. The possible withdrawal by the United States of its obligations under the INF Treaty and its unclear position on extending the Strategic Arms Treaty pose the risk of an uncontrolled arms race.
We presume that the BRICS countries will hold a common position on these critical issues. This will be an important factor in mobilising the efforts of the world community for the sake of international security and stability.
Colleagues,
I would like to note with satisfaction that the BRICS countries have largely coinciding approaches to the key issues on the G20 agenda. Our countries have great economic, innovative, and human potential.
The BRICS countries have already overtaken the G7 in terms of aggregate GDP ($44 trillion) and in purchasing power parity. They can play a more significant role in the global financial system, push for the continuation of the IMF reform and for greater influence in the IMF.
A significant contribution to financial stability has been made by the new development bank, which is now supporting 26 projects in BRICS countries with $6.5 billion in financing. We also expect the bond and national currencies fund of the BRICS countries to become available in 2019, which would allow strengthening financial and investment stability and expanding the interaction of national payment systems.
We are committed to supporting the groundwork for the process of further developing the World Trade Organisation to stabilise it. It is important that trade disputes are settled exclusively through dialogue that all interested countries can join.
We pay special attention to coordinating the BRICS countries’ positions on issues related to energy and climate change. Russia, as a reliable exporter of energy to many countries and regions in the world, intends to continue to actively participate in harmonising global energy markets jointly with other suppliers and consumers of fuel and to provide global energy security.
We welcome the fact that the Paris Agreement on climate has come into effect and believe it to be a reliable international legal instrument for long-term climate regulation. It is critically important to finish drafting the rules to implement it, taking into consideration the views of all stakeholders. 
We regard the sustainable development of agriculture as a key topic on the G20 agenda. Russia is a large producer and exporter of agricultural produce, contributing significantly to food security. Over the last 10 years, we supplied over 650,000 tonnes of food and humanitarian aid to more than 110 countries.
We believe it is important that this year agreements on the digital economy and adaptation of the labour market and education systems have been reached within the G20. We express our gratitude to our BRICS partners for supporting the Russian idea of consumer rights’ protection in the digital economy and our initiatives to step up coordinated actions at the UN on internet governance and international information security.
The agenda also includes the important topic of combatting corruption. We are ready to work together, including in line with India’s proposal to pursue fugitive economic criminals. During discussions at the UN, I am counting on the support of BRICS members for the Russian draft international convention on returning stolen assets.
Colleagues, in conclusion I would like to wish success to our Brazilian partners next year, during their chairmanship of BRICS. We will provide all the necessary assistance.
Thank you for your attention.

USA,11-10-2018 00:00,Donald Trump,Remarks by President Trump at the Interagency Task Force to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons Annual Meeting,"THE PRESIDENT: Thank you. Please. Thank you very much. Thank you. It’s a great honor. Thank you very much. Thank you to Ivanka for the wonderful introduction. She knows me well. And also, very importantly, on the tremendous work you’ve done on this on behalf of human trafficking victims and survivors all over the world. Very important subject.

And incredibly, with the age of the computer, it’s gotten worse and worse and worse every year. And we’re going to turn that around.

This is an urgent humanitarian issue. My administration is committed to leveraging every resource we have to confront this threat, to support the victims and survivors, and to hold traffickers accountable for their heinous crimes.

Before going any further today, I’d like to provide an update on Hurricane Michael, which made landfall along Florida’s great Panhandle. Incredible people in the Panhandle, and they went through a lot. Followed a really destructive path; then to Georgia and North and South Carolina.

Our prayers are with those who lost their lives and with their families. And our hearts are with the thousands who have sustained property damage — in many cases entirely wiped out — the many families who have been displaced and the businesses that have been affected by this devastating hurricane.

All residents should heed all local warnings and instructions. My administration is in constant contact with state and local authorities in Florida, Alabama, Georgia, South Carolina and North Carolina. FEMA and first responders are on the ground, and we have teams currently conducting search and rescue missions — by the way, the Coast Guard has been incredible; they’ve saved many lives — working to restore power and delivering needed supplies.

We will do everything in our power to help those in need. And we will not rest or waver until the job is done and the recovery is complete. The only thing we can say about Michael with certainty is that it was so fast, it went through like a bullet, but it was a devastating bullet. It was complete. It was winds about as big as we’ve ever seen in history. We’ve never had anything like this.

So I just want to thank everybody for working so hard and for FEMA, and first responders, and law enforcement. They have been incredible. Incredible. Thank you very much.

Today we’re gathered together for a truly important mission: ending the scourge of human trafficking.

Joining us are top officials from across our government who are deeply engaged in this effort. Also, Senator Rob Portman is with us someplace. Rob, thank you very much for coming.

I’d like to just introduce a few of the people that have worked so hard: Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. Secretary Nielsen. Secretary, thank you. Good job. I know you’re working very hard on this. Ryan Zinke. Ryan, thank you. Thank you. Alex Acosta. Thank you very much. Rod Rosenstein. Thank you, Rod. Alex Azar. Thank you very much. Great job you’re doing. Thank you, Alex. Elaine Chao. Thank you, Elaine. And Betsy DeVos. Thank you. Thank you very much.

Along with Ambassadors Nikki Haley — and what a job you’ve done. Thank you very much, Nikki. And you know how we feel. Bob Lighthizer. Thanks, Bob. Dan Coats. And Director Chris Wray. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you, Chris, very much. Appreciate it very much. You really — you’re making big difference and you’ll make an even bigger different because we’re making it a lot easier for you now. We’re going to give you what you need to get this done — as much as you can. It’s a tough one.

Thank you as well to Representative Ann Wagner who has been a great leader in the fight against human trafficking. Thank you, Ann, very much. Thank you very much.

Most importantly, I want to thank the courageous survivors of human trafficking for joining us today. From the beginning of my administration, I promised we would direct the full might and force of the United States government to combat the sinister crime of trafficking. And that is exactly what we are doing.

We’re working to aggressively target traffickers and to protect the victims of this inhumane abuse. In my first month in office, I signed an executive order directing federal law enforcement to prioritize dismantling the criminal organizations that engage in human trafficking. I later hosted survivors and experts here at the White House on numerous occasions for a conversation about how we can strengthen and improve our nation’s anti-trafficking efforts.

Since the time and since that moment — very first moment — we’ve really made tremendous strides. We’re challenging foreign regimes that facilitate this horrible evil of sex trafficking and forced labor. And we’re working to take down the criminal organizations that illegally traffic drugs and people across our border, exploiting them for their own gain. And we are pursuing criminal charges against those who perpetrate these monstrous acts and deeds.

Last year, my administration prosecuted a record number of traffickers. The Department of Health and Human Services National Human Trafficking Hotline received over 8,500 reports of potential trafficking last year. And our brave heroes at ICE have made over 1,600 human trafficking arrests. They do a great job.

I have signed several anti-trafficking bills into law, including a landmark law championed by Representative Wagner. And, Representative, where are you? Please. Fantastic job, Ann. Thank you very much. Really appreciate it. To help states and victims to fight online sex trafficking.

Under this law, victims can now bring civil suits against websites involved in sex trafficking — it’s so important — so you can bring civil suits against these websites, and states can bring criminal charges. These provisions complement existing laws that the Department of Justice used to seize and shut down Backpage.com, the Internet’s leading forum for traffickers, earlier this year. Good job, Rod. Really good job.

We also included tough forced-labor provisions in the new U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement — USMCA, as it’s known. Great agreement. And we are taking the lead to combat this crime internationally, having invested millions in the Global Fund to End Modern Slavery. If you can believe that title — it’s to end modern slavery.

This is just a brief overview of our government-wide effort to smash these criminal networks and to help victims rebuild their lives.

Every Cabinet member here today and every member of this presidential taskforce is fully engaged in the fight. It’s very important to every one of them.

Our country will not rest until we have put these vile organizations out of business, and rescued every last victim. And we will not stop until we have stamped out the menace of human trafficking once and for all.

Again, I want to thank everybody for the incredible job you’re doing, for your good work. So important. Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you everybody. Thank you. (Applause.) Thank you. Thank you.",President,Donald Trump,https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefings-statements/remarks-president-trump-interagency-task-force-monitor-combat-trafficking-persons-annual-meeting/,,DEVELOPMENT
Russia,01-11-2001 00:00,Vladimir Putin,Speech at the All-Russian Conference of Prosecutors,"Good afternoon.

Today’s conference – and it is more than a meeting of the Collegium, it is an All-Russia Conference – falls on your professional holiday. It will actually be tomorrow and I hope that you haven’t yet started the celebrations so we will be able to discuss all the problems that face the prosecutor’s office today in a constructive manner.

In addition to discussing day-to-day problems, you will discuss the strategy of the development of the prosecutor’s office. The place and role of the Russian prosecutor’s office in the system of government bodies has been widely discussed in society and in the media lately.

The Constitution of the Russian Federation has left open the question of the place of the prosecutor’s office in the system of government bodies. Unfortunately, the current law on the prosecutor’s office does not fully fill that gap. The current concept fails to provide a full and clear answer to theoretical and indeed many practical questions. Prosecutors themselves are known to differ on how to tackle these questions. So I think that this conference and the choice of the key topic of discussion are very timely and appropriate.

The Russian prosecutor’s office has deep roots that go back to the times of Peter the Great, Catherine II and the reforms of Alexander II. To be a prosecutor today is a challenging job, as we know only too well. Often the prosecutor’s office is held responsible for the woes and faults of the whole law enforcement system. There is a reason for that: its vast functions and strong supervisory powers naturally lead the prosecutor’s office to try to compensate for the weaknesses of the system of law and order in our country.

But I am sure that you understand the situation in the country and in society. In the heat of public polemics the prosecutor’s office is sometimes described as a hangover from the totalitarian times, and these accusations have been levelled for several years now. People recall the times when the prosecutor’s office authority was used to cover up lawlessness in the country. But it would be relevant to recall that at the time lawlessness was rampant in the country, the authority of the courts and the authority of the whole state machine was also used as a cover. Those times are history.

We have long been living in a different country; and the prosecutor’s office is constantly improving, it is not standing still. Changes in the prosecutor’s office meet the goals of democratisation of the legal and law enforcement system in Russia. Besides, they smooth the contradictions between the legal systems of Russia and those of our international partners.

Among the many areas in the work of the prosecutor’s office one stands out: the coordination of the work of law enforcement bodies on crime control. That function is closely linked with other areas of activity: criminal investigation, oversight of preliminary investigation and inquests. Of course, coordination of efforts in fighting crime should be less a departmental than a government concern, and it should be done within the law.

But until such an approach has been worked out – and one has to admit that it is not unfortunately the case – the prosecutor’s office has to compensate for that drawback. No one else is up to the task today, and this is a function of the prosecutor’s office under the law. That is why the prosecutor’s office bears a large part of the responsibility for coordinated teamwork of all the law enforcement bodies in the country.

I am aware that your workload exceeds all reasonable limits. By the way, I see some vacant seats in the gallery, so we could give thought to increasing the number of prosecutors.

But I would like you to join other law enforcement bodies in analysing the crime situation and forecasting the crime trends. It is important for us to know the true crime situation in the country.

It is not for nothing that prosecutors are referred to as the soldiers of law and order. Like military people, you take your oath, and it is not by chance that almost all of you wear uniforms. You are often treated in the same way as military men and security men. We recognise the strength of the prosecutor’s office in upholding legality in the country. The performance of the prosecutor’s office adds to the authority of state power which is obliged to provide secure conditions of life for every Russian citizen.

Today the human rights aspect comes to the fore in the work of the prosecutor’s office. We have tended to talk about human rights more than to actually defend them. In fact, he who talks the most often does the least. The prosecutors belong to that part of the government apparatus who speak less, but do more, and must do still more. You have vast room for improvement.

As far as I know, during the past year more than 2 million Russians have filed complaints on these issues with the prosecutor’s office, and one in every four complaints has been met. We know that one of the most frequent complaints with which people come to the prosecutor’s office is violation of citizens’ rights in matters of labour and housing. Your good work in this field undoubtedly strengthens the confidence of Russian citizens in the power and justice of the state. This is a key area of the prosecutor’s office activities.

Another important task we face is to strengthen the state, its federal system and to preserve the legal and economic integrity of the country. The prosecutor’s office, as a supervisory body, has vast opportunities for influencing law-making and law enforcement practices in the Russian regions. The dedication of the prosecutors claims much of the credit for the fact that last year Russian legislation has been cleansed of unconstitutional laws or laws and regulations that contradict federal laws.

The Constitutions and Charters of the 60 regions of the Federation and 2,312 regulatory acts have been harmonised with the Russian Constitution and federal laws. It is incredible how we managed to exist normally in a situation when there was no normal existence. But law-making is an ongoing process, as you know better than anyone. So the prosecutor’s office must continue to promptly identify every regional regulatory act that contradicts federal legislation.

Besides, the review of the body of laws has so far left untouched the decisions of local government bodies and departmental instructions. One has to admit that some federal legislation does not always correspond to the laws and Constitution of Russia, as many regional leaders have rightly pointed out. To be quite honest, we have to admit that the backlogs we have had to clear last year did not arise in the summer of last year. Which means that we have been derelict in our duties over the past years. I hope you all understand that what we have accomplished last year is only the beginning of a systematic and consistent effort.

The Prosecutor General’s Office Directorates in the federal districts have an important role to play in coordinating the activities of regional prosecutor’s offices, especially on issues of compliance with the Constitution and Russian legislation, and human and civil rights. The early months of the work in the districts show that you are well equipped to produce results in this sphere.

I am aware that some prosecutors have been demanding more powers, especially in connection with the formation of districts. I think that, as the saying goes, “stealing the show” is not always the best way to tackle problems. To assume responsibility for everything is hardly a reasonable approach, and even such a powerful and authoritative organisation as the prosecutor’s office is unable to stop all the gaps in the Russian legal system.

It is far more important to make up our minds on priorities and strategy. I think that in addition to the priorities I have already mentioned, special attention should be paid to protecting property, both private and state property, to protecting the rights of businessmen and enforcing the laws that protect economic freedom. Today all the signs are that the development of the Russian economy, without exaggeration, hinges on the prosecutor’s office and the work of law courts.

To cope with the tasks facing the prosecutor’s office today requires a high level of skills. There are some things that only you can do: it is up to the prosecutor to produce a full and well-argued statement of indictment, it is the prosecutor who draws on the work of investigators and operatives, so one of the immediate tasks is to make the activities of prosecutors in supporting state prosecution in courts more effective.

There are serious flaws in this work at present. Often the functions of the state prosecutor are performed by people who are not fit to work in the public sphere, to which the law court belongs. The task of supporting the case for the prosecution is often given at the eleventh hour, and still more often prosecutors are not present during court hearings. As a result the failure of the prosecution allows people who have broken the law to walk away free. So, evil goes unpunished and justice does not triumph.

I am dwelling on this problem in some detail because the judiciary reform cannot be effective without an active involvement of the prosecutors in the court proceedings. Moreover, improvement of the court system should proceed in parallel with improvement of the prosecutor’s office work.

I am sure that the prosecutor’s office has been and remains a key pillar of the Russian law enforcement system. And I am sure that your expertise and sense of responsibility will match the new challenges facing the country.

Once again I congratulate you warmly on your professional holiday and I wish you and your families all the best in the new year.

Thank you.",President,Vladimir Putin,http://en.kremlin.ru/events/president/transcripts/statements/21161,,OTHERS
United Kingdom,28-Jan-11,David Cameron,Prime Minister's speech at the World Economic Forum,"Prime Minister It’s been four decades since you first invited European business leaders up this mountain and gave them a stark message modernise and adapt - or fall behind and fail. Forty years on, here we are again. No one can deny what a difficult position Europe is in at the moment. Four years of annual growth have been wiped out. Unemployment has risen to the double digits. Yes, recovery has begun. But while economies like India, Brazil and China are steaming ahead in Europe, the drag on growth has persisted. Indeed, Europe’s share of world output is projected to fall by just under a third in the next two decades. And no one is immune. This week, we had disappointing growth estimates back home. Yes, they were partly driven by the terrible weather which shut down airports, factories and schools - but let’s be frank. They also brought home something we have said for months: given the traumas of recent years, the recovery was always going to be choppy. So as we meet at Davos, the big questions are these: How can we get our economies going? How can we get Europe going? How do we go for growth? Now, there are some who say that slow-growth status for Europe is inevitable. They are the pessimists - and this is their charter. One - we in Europe are incapable of solving our debt and deficit problems. Two - we’re unable to compete with dynamic economies because we’ll always be over-burdened with regulation and bureaucracy. Three - we’re hardwired to be consumers and not producers. And four - we’re attached to liberal values that are leaving us far behind the juggernaut of authoritarian capitalism. Today, I want to make the case for optimism - for confidence in our future. We can overcome these problems but we do need a change of direction. Huge deficits don’t just fall out of the sky. Complex rules which restrict labour markets are not some naturally occurring phenomenon. Crushing regulation is not some external plague that’s been visited on our businesses. All of these result from decisions we have taken - alone or together. In many ways, we in Europe have been our own worst enemy. But that also means the power is in us to change to make it easier for businesses to start up and prosper to open new markets - within Europe and between Europe and the rest of the world. And with so many of Europe’s leaders committed to open markets and reform, I’d argue there has never been a better time to do this. In less than eight weeks we will announce our Budget for growth at home and I will also set out a specific plan for growth in Europe. Today, I want to talk about the new direction Europe needs to take. Our first priority is to kill off the spectre of massive sovereign debts. Those who argue that dealing with our deficit and promoting growth are somehow alternatives are wrong. You cannot put off the first in order to promote the second. Average government debt in the EU is almost eighty per cent of GDP. Some countries are again borrowing five, six or seven per cent of GDP again this year. The figure for the UK is more than ten per cent. This is clearly unsustainable and action cannot be put off. Let’s put this in context. Remember what we started with in the UK: an economy built on the worst deficit, the most leveraged banks, the most indebted households, the biggest housing boom and unsustainable levels of public spending and immigration. And now think of where we need to go: an economy based not on consumption and debt but on savings and investment not on government spending but on entrepreneurial dynamism not on one industry in one corner of the country but on all our businesses in all our regions, with a new emphasis on manufacturing, exports and trade. To get there isn’t easy. We can’t just flick on the switch of government spending or pump the bubble back up. Making this transformation - and it is a transformation - requires painstaking work and it takes time. It involves paying down billions of pounds of debt. New plants and factories need to be built. New products designed. New innovations taken to market. New businesses nurtured. It’s going to be tough - but we must see it through. The scale of the task is immense, so we need to be bold in order to build this economy of the future. The British people know these things. They understand there are no short-cuts to a better future. And already we’re making progress. Not long ago we were heading towards the danger zone where markets start to question your credibility. Yet in the past eight months we’ve seen our credit rating - which was on the brink of being downgraded - affirmed at the triple A level. We’ve seen market interest rates - which were in danger of spiralling - actually fall. All this has happened not in spite of our plan to cut the deficit, but because of it. That’s why we must stick to the course we have set out. Allied to this fiscal discipline has got to be the reform and strengthening of Europe’s banks. Last year’s round of stress tests didn’t go nearly far enough. They said we were three and a half billion euros short - then six months down the line Irish banks alone needed ten times that. This year’s tests have got to be tougher: Stretching over a three-year period. Covering liquidity as well as capital. And involving independent bodies like the IMF. But above all what we urgently need in Europe is an aggressive, pan-continental drive to unleash enterprise. . At home we have cut corporation tax, cut the small business rate, funded a new enterprise allowance and got a grip on regulation. We’ve sent huge trade delegations to the fastest-growing economies all over the world, sending out the message that Britain is back open for business. And in the essential work of sorting out the deficit, we have made the decision to prioritise growth. So we’re making cuts to the welfare budget - which is hugely difficult so that we can fund big transport projects on our roads and railways. We’re not cutting schools - indeed we’re boosting the number of apprenticeships - even though cuts elsewhere are deep. And we’re striking the right balance between tax and spending, with spending cuts taking three quarters of the strain and tax rises a quarter. Where we are raising taxes, it’s on what people spend - so that we don’t have to hike up taxes on jobs. But this is not just about what we do in our domestic economies. We need boldness in Europe too, not least on deregulation. I’ve had conversations with many European leaders about this - including Prime Ministers Fillon and Rutte -and we’re agreed we just cannot afford to load more costs on to business. And I believe there are clear things we can and should do: Bring in a one-in, one-out rule for new European regulations. Set a new and tougher target to actually reduce the total regulatory burden over the life of this Commission. And give small businesses - engines of job creation - an exemption from big new regulations. Taking them out of EU accounting rules alone would save them around 2 billion euros. Now is the time to go for a genuine single market too. Nearly twenty years since Europe agreed to the free movement of people and services we’ve still got companies employing teams of lawyers just so they can trade across the nearest border. Jacques Delors once said that nobody can fall in love with the single market - and frankly, no one ever will if we carry on like this. Let’s look at how we can put an end to all those restrictive rules - who can hold shares in which companies, where businesses can set up and how many people they can employ and most importantly, let’s deliver on this with a tough, transparent approach to enforcing the single market. Fail here and we’ll fall behind. Succeed - and we could add up to 180 billion euros to Europe’s economy. Of course our biggest ambitions have got to be for innovation. I don’t believe for one moment we need to be downbeat about this in Europe. It was British scientists who unravelled the genome who helped design the i-pod who invented the world wide web. Where is the world’s capital for high quality industrial design? Not the US, not Asia - Europe. We’ve got the raw material of good ideas - let’s get better at exploiting them. Access to finance is crucial. For every euro invested in venture capital in Europe, more than seven times that is invested in the US. We need to do more to incentivise the same kind of risk-taking investment culture over here. Back home we’ve introduced a patent box offering a ten per cent tax rate on patent income. But action like this will be worth little if we can’t break the deadlock on a Europe-wide patent system. Do you know how long we’ve been discussing this? Almost forty years. The truth is we can talk all we like about making this continent the capital for innovation but while it can cost up to thirty five thousand euros to get patents in just thirteen member states, it’s never going to happen. The possibility of progress is there - we’ve just got to seize it. So we can develop even more of the goods and services the world wants to buy. And that’s precisely why we in Europe shouldn’t be cautious about trade - we should be actively, aggressively pushing for it. I know every speaker at events like this talks about concluding Doha as a matter of urgency - and I agree. But we all need to be equally clear about how it’s going to happen not with more warm words but with more on the table from all sides. A little more on cotton and safeguards in agriculture. A little more on industrial goods, especially from emerging markets. More from all sides on services - where the gains are huge. No more stubbornness. No more hiding offers in back pockets. 2011 is the make or break year. And there are other things we must do at the same time. Last year we signed a Free Trade Agreement with South Korea worth up to thirty three billion euros to EU exporters. We can and we must do the same with India, Canada, Latin America, the Middle East, the ASEAN block. We have the goods the world wants to buy - now let’s have the confidence to strike those deals and sell them. There’s one final thing we in Europe need to have more confidence about - and that is our values. The value of liberal democracy used to be sacred in the West. Now some people are doubting it. They’ve seen authoritarian capitalism and the way it works. They see political leaders with the powers of juggernauts, forcing decisions through and they argue that against this, our liberal democratic values look outdated, ineffective - even an obstacle to success. I passionately disagree. It’s these values that create the climate for innovation. Look at where the big ideas come from - the facebooks and the Spotifys - and the vast majority are from open societies. That’s because good ideas come through freedom - free thinking and the free association of like-minded people. Our values create the right climate for business too. If you’re looking to set up a headquarters abroad, are you going to invest Where your premises can be taken away from you? Where contracts are routinely dishonoured? Where there’s the threat of political upheaval? Or are you going to invest where there are property rights, the rule of law, democratic accountability? These values aren’t some quaint constitutional add-on they are an integral and irreducible part of our success today and tomorrow - and all of us must always remember that. So my message today is one of confidence. We are an open, trading continent. We have a proud record of invention. We’ve got advanced democratic values. But yes, we’ve got to recognise that Europe has got to earn its way. The world doesn’t owe us a living. So let’s make the choice to do things differently, to fight for our prosperity. If we set our sights high if we take bold decisions in deregulation, on opening up the single market, on innovation and on trade then together we can defy the pessimists and together, recover our dynamism.",Prime Minister,David Cameron,https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/prime-ministers-speech-at-the-world-economic-forum,,DEVELOPMENT
USA,18-01-2014,Barack Obama,"
Weekly Address: Making 2014 a Year of Action to Expand Opportunities for the Middle Class"," Hi, everybody.  This week, I visited a company in Raleigh, North Carolina that helps make electric motors that save businesses money on energy costs and cut harmful carbon pollution. 

And I stopped by N.C. State University, where engineers are set to develop the new technology that will make those motors even better.

It’s part of my push not only to make America home to more high-tech manufacturing – but to make America more attractive for the good jobs that a growing middle class requires. 

And increasingly, we are.  Thanks in part to our all-of-the-above strategy for American energy, for the first time in nearly two decades, we produce more oil here at home than we buy from the rest of the world.  We generate more renewable energy than ever, and more natural gas than anybody.  Health care costs are growing at their slowest rate in 50 years – due in part to the Affordable Care Act.  And since I took office, we’ve cut our deficits by more than half.

So we are primed to bring back more of the good jobs claimed by the recession, and lost to overseas competition in recent decades.  But that requires a year of action.  And I want to work with Congress this year on proven ways to create jobs, like building infrastructure and fixing our broken immigration system.

Where Congress isn’t acting, I’ll act on my own to put opportunity within reach for anyone who’s willing to work for it. That’s what I did in Raleigh by launching America’s second “manufacturing innovation institute.”  It’s a partnership between companies, colleges, and the federal government focused on making sure American businesses and American workers win the race for high-tech manufacturing and the jobs that come with it – jobs that can help people and communities willing to work hard punch their ticket into the middle class. 

I firmly believe that this can be a breakthrough year for America.  But to make that happen, we’re gonna have to act – to create good jobs that pay good wages, and to offer more Americans a fair shot to get ahead.  That’s what I’m focused on every day that I have the privilege of serving as your president. That’s what I’m going to be focused on every single day of this year.

Thanks, and have a great weekend.",President,Barack Obama,https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/the-press-office/2014/01/18/weekly-address-making-2014-year-action-expand-opportunities-middle-class,,OTHERS
Russia,19-08-2009,Dmitry Medvedev,Speech at Meeting on Measures to Stabilise the Socio-Political Situation and Neutralise the Terrorist and Extremist Threat in the North Caucasus,"Colleagues,

Today we are meeting to discuss additional measures for neutralising terrorist and extremist threats in the North Caucasus.

I specifically chose to gather you here in this format: in addition to federal-level executives of law enforcement and security agencies, other meeting participants include interior ministers, heads of the main departments and local departments of the interior from various Russian constituent entities, and directors of the Federal Security Service [FSB] branches in the North Caucasus.

The reason for this meeting should be clear to everyone. I would like to say a few words regarding my views on this situation.

Some time ago, it started to appear that the situation concerning acts of terrorism in the Caucasus had improved significantly. Unfortunately, recent events show that this is not the case and that if efforts of countering terrorism are halted, there are serious negative consequences. Thus, despite certain progress reached in recent years, the measures to counteract terrorism will be continued and enhanced and new approaches applied.

The latest tragic events seriously require reassessment of the attitude to the problem. The relevant decisions should aim to improve the situation significantly. There should not be any pointless long-windedness. The overall situation is reflected in information summaries which all of you receive daily and which list all relevant details such as skirmish locations, numbers of terrorists killed and wounded, numbers of civilians and law enforcement officers injured. An overall improvement is therefore required, not some minor stabilisation, bur real, tangible stability.

I will list the measures to be taken urgently and I certainly expect that over the course of the meeting you will make your comments and proposals to elaborate on my suggestions.

I would identify eight main areas where we must concentrate our efforts, although there may be others as well.

First, we must optimise coordination among various agencies. This is a never-ending story of a permanent organisation and reorganisation of such coordination. Still, the recent acts of terror evidence that the teamwork of law enforcement agencies is far from being normal or efficient, and should therefore be restructured.

Second – and this is a very important challenge – we must pursue a thorough overhaul of human resources organisation and work at all levels, from patrol and sentry officers right up to the officials in charge of subdivisions of the Interior Ministry, Federal Security Service and other security and law enforcement agencies.

We need professional and well-trained officers, ideally, absolutely new ones, properly trained at local police schools and academies. At the moment some regions within the Southern Federal District, first and foremost, of the North Caucasus, lack professional law enforcement officers. Until this problem is resolved and until we get enough local human resources, officers from other regions and from the federal head offices should be temporarily assigned here.

To accomplish that, a broad combination of incentives should be devised and applied to law enforcement officers who operate in hazardous environment and are exposed to fatal risks, i.e. to those who are either permanently stationed here or temporarily assigned to local agencies from other regions or from the federal offices. Those should certainly be financial incentives and they may not be economised on even in the times of hardships our country is now experiencing.

Of course, I will instruct the Cabinet accordingly on allocating additional funding. For that, there should be an estimate of the number of officers likely to be sent here from other regions, and there should be some general understanding of the support measures for the law enforcement agencies and employees here in the Caucasus, as not a single task will be accomplished without a proper set of incentives.

The incentives in law enforcement must be coupled with discharging those malfeasants who abuse their duties; such cases are regretfully abundant.

We will not be able to revert the situation instantaneously, but we must nevertheless strive to improve it. Effective, tough and consistent action is also needed to put an end to domination of clan interests, to the sale of job positions, and to fight all forms of corruption.

At the same time, it is imperative to address the problem of inappropriate spending and misappropriation of government funds, the problem which has become critical in the North Caucasus. Of course, the situation is far from ideal in other regions, too, as corruption is an evil that has infected our entire country. Still, corruption is much more widespread and deep-rooted in government institutions in the North Caucasus compared to other regions.

My next point is that we must effectively guarantee the protection of law enforcement personnel, as this is the factor affecting the peaceful lives and well-being of millions of our people. I refer to protection in the broadest sense of the word which includes the above financial incentives, insurance, and employing advanced means and mechanisms for guarding sites, buildings, compounds, and temporary facilities, because most of what is currently in place is absolutely inadequate. The latest terrorist attack in Nazran was a tragic proof of such inadequacy, as lack in basic precautions and simple security measures resulted in deaths of and injuries to an enormous number of policemen. This was all due to unforgivable mistakes which, to say it plainly, may qualify to a crime.

Senior officers at all levels of the law enforcement agencies represented here today will be held responsible for failures in employing proper security measures. Such failures will result in dismissals, regardless of previous records. The officers in charge of security arrangements will be held directly responsible for any casualties. Keep this in mind.

We must also think about amending our legislation. Yesterday, I held a meeting with heads of the federal law enforcement agencies and we reviewed at least a few suggestions in this regard. I think we could further discuss them today as well.

I believe that within a very short period of time a decision could be approved on the procedures for changing territorial jurisdiction for terrorism- or extremism-related criminal trials, to ensure that criminals and corruptionists cannot exert pressure on courts hearing such cases. If we cannot do a good job of bringing these criminals to justice here, then let’s do it in Moscow, St Petersburg, Kamchatka, or wherever else. One way or another, they must be sentenced and serve their terms.

There is another very complicated issue which we nevertheless should examine and discuss. It is the issue of declaring ineligibility of certain criminal deeds for trials by jury. First and foremost, I am referring to cases involving organised criminal groups and associations. Unfortunately, juries fail to properly handle such cases for a variety of reasons. I believe such cases and such crimes should be heard by panels of professional judges.

There have been other suggestions on improving the procedures for appointing judges and court-martial officers, which we will discuss today.

There is another matter to be addressed and I hereby instruct the Security Council Secretary and Presidential Plenipotentiary Envoy to the Southern Federal District to hold a full-fledged meeting on the socio-economic development of the Caucasus and South Russia. We need to make additional efforts. Most importantly, we need new projects and new jobs, because crime is still rooted in the same societal ills: low living standards, poverty, and the dominance of corrupt officials. As a result, people lack the motivation to engage in a normal lifestyle and therefore choose asocial behaviour and illicit means to safeguard their rights.

My last comment is, those who committed the recent crimes against the officials, law enforcement officers, regular citizens, and human rights activists of Ingushetia must face a severe and inescapable punishment. We must insistently fight terrorists, dispensing with all niceties, eliminating them without emotion or hesitation. Otherwise, we will not be able to achieve any success.

***

Mr Yedelev [Deputy Interior Minister Arkady Yedelev], I would like you to help Ingushetia's Ministry of the Interior to organise its work properly. Help them to build up their personnel, have some officers temporarily assigned here. They will need your moral support as well. Today we have discussed financial assistance, a set of measures to be implemented not only in Ingushetia, but in Ingushetia as well as in other regions.

You talked about the impact of various factors, international factors such as the attempts to finance underground criminal gangs, to export religious extremism; you are right, these external factors have an impact. But the main problem is, sadly, rooted in our country. You know exactly when conditions for the development of crime and religious extremism were established: following the disintegration of the state. The roots of the problem are in the makeup of our lives: in unemployment, poverty, in clans who don't give a whit about the people, but simply divide the cash flows arriving here among themselves, who fight for contracts and then with each other to settle scores, and in corruption which, indeed, has become very widespread within the law enforcement agencies too. You know all this as well.

Our task is to eradicate these problems. Let’s be realistic: the task is very complex and will take many years. But no one will resolve this problem for us. The law enforcement component is important in this respect and the socio-economic one even more so, but this is the topic for another meeting.",President,Dmitry Medvedev,http://en.kremlin.ru/events/president/transcripts/statements/48444,,EXTREMISM
USA,23-03-2015,Barack Obama,"
Remarks by the President at the SelectUSA Investment Summit","Thank you so much.  (Applause.)  Thank you. Please have a seat.  Well, thank you, everybody.  And let me begin by thanking Penny Pritzker for her outstanding leadership. We’ve got six Cabinet Secretaries and dozens of U.S. ambassadors here, which should tell you that SelectUSA is a major priority for this administration.  Since I was here with you 17 months ago, this gathering has doubled in size.  So I want to thank all 2,600 of you -- elected officials and local leaders from across this country, and business leaders from around the world -- thank you for making this a priority, as well.

The fact is there’s never been a more exciting time for us to do business together.  And today, I want to talk about why America is not only the right place for you to invest, but why America is the safest, strongest, smartest place for you to invest than we’ve been in a long time.

After the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression, America is now in the midst of the longest streak of private sector job growth on record -- 60 straight months; 12 million new jobs.  Businesses in America have added more than 200,000 jobs each month for 12 straight months.  That’s the first time that’s happened in nearly 40 years. 

Our unemployment rate has fallen from a peak of 10 percent in 2009 to 5.5 percent today.  After a decade of outsourcing, we’re starting to bring good jobs back to America.  Over the last five years, manufacturers have added jobs at a rate not seen since the 1980s.  In fact, the manufacturing sector is actually growing faster than the rest of the economy.  And last week, I announced nearly $500 million in new public and private investment in strengthening American manufacturing. 

And even though the United States is already home to more foreign direct investment than any other country in the world, we’ve worked hard to address some of the challenges that held us back for too long.  Our high school graduation rate is now at an all-time high.  More young people are earning their college degrees than ever before.  Our energy production is booming, our energy costs are low, our leadership on climate change is restored.  On the fiscal front, our deficits have shrunk by two-thirds.  Our health care costs are flattening out for the first time in half a century. 

Over the past six years, we’ve worked hard to make ourselves a smarter place to invest and to do business than any other country in the world.  So we've got a good story to tell.  And that’s one reason I created SelectUSA, the first-ever government-wide initiative to encourage more companies from around the world to invest and create jobs right here in the United States.  We've got a good story to tell, but we want to make sure all of you had a chance to hear it.  And the SelectUSA team wakes up every morning with one mission -- bringing job-creating investment to the United States of America.  It's a kind of one-stop shop, sort of a match-making service for investment.

Economic development organizations from around the country can connect with foreign investors from around the world who are interested in bringing their businesses here.  Now, understand a lot of state and local leaders in this room have been working tirelessly for a long time to attract foreign investment.  The idea behind SelectUSA is just to make it easier for you to do that, and easier for our international partners to find the best opportunities.

And by the beginning of this year, SelectUSA had assisted more than 1,000 clients, helping to generate more than $20 billion of investment in the United States -- investment that has spurred economic growth and created jobs all across the country. The companies in this room have invested $13 billion over the last year, which will create an estimated 32,500 new jobs. 

So what’s great about SelectUSA is that everybody wins.  Communities that welcome foreign investors see more jobs and economic activity and they can reach more potential investors.  The companies that invest in America have access to the largest market in the world -- and it's a market that is strong and stable, and growing.

And one thing I want to emphasize, it’s not just big corporations or billion-dollar investments that make a difference.  With the help of SelectUSA, for example, a Canadian company named Peds Legwear invested $7 million to rescue a failing sock company in Burke County, North Carolina.  And that investment saved 45 jobs.  They recently cut the ribbon on a new plant that will ultimately create more than 200 new jobs.  Had a little cheer back there.  That's good.  (Applause.)  

With the help from SelectUSA, Reha Technology, a Swiss medical robotics firm, just announced its merger with an American company called Interactive Motion Technologies.  The new company will headquarter in Watertown, Massachusetts -- and today it’s announcing a new $5 million investment to expand this year.

So we’re seeing real results from SelectUSA, and we want to build on that momentum and get even more of you to invest.  So today, we’re going to expand and improve our services.  We’re launching a new partnership between state and federal economic development officials.  We’re launching the SelectUSA Academy, with online and on-site training programs for investors.  We’re improving our online investment tools, helping companies identify state-based incentives so that they can decide where to invest.

So for companies considering new investment here, I want to be as clear as possible.  The United States of America is the best place in the world to do business.  We’ve got the most skilled and productive workers, the best universities, the most innovative entrepreneurs in the world.  We’re the global leader in patents –- home not only to more R&D investment than any other country but to nearly one-third of all R&D investment in the world.  Our access to global markets makes it easy to ship goods made in the USA around the world.  Our commitment to the rule of law and strong intellectual property protections make America a dependable place to innovate and do business.

And we’re a country that always believes we can be better, a country that adapts and advances, and sets new standards for new times.  It’s one of the reasons why I put forward a budget for this coming fiscal year that reflects the realities of the new economy.  We’re going to give workers and businesses the tools they need to succeed in a fast-paced, highly competitive, constantly changing world.  And that means new investments in education, new investments in job training, including making two years of community college free, because we want to make sure that our workers continue to be prepared to fill the jobs that you intend to bring here.  It means new investments in manufacturing, and 21st century infrastructure that 21st century businesses need.  We’re modernizing port, strengthening our bridges, making Internet and wireless and broadband far more accessible more quickly. 

Now, that’s my budget.  I recognize there’s something called Congress here and there are going to be some negotiations taking place.  So far, Republicans in Congress have put forward a different kind of budget.  But I’m confident that we can find a way forward.  I’m confident that we can find a path that doesn’t undermine our standing, but strengthens it.  Because the things that help businesses grow are not partisan.  There shouldn’t be anything partisan about making sure that our kids get the best education possible, or that we’ve got world-class infrastructure. 

We’re working together on a bipartisan Trade Promotion Authority and strong new trade deals from Asia to Europe that aren’t just free but are also fair and reciprocal -- trade deals that help businesses grow our exports and put American workers first.  And I’m confident we can, together, reauthorize the Export-Import Bank of the United States, giving our businesses one more tool that they need to compete.

Today, I’m pleased to announce a new action I’m also taking to make it easier for global companies who are present here today to launch and invest in the U.S.  My administration is going to reform the L-1B visa category, which allows corporations to temporarily move workers from a foreign office to a U.S. office in a faster, simpler way.  And this could benefit hundreds of thousands of nonimmigrant workers and their employers; that, in turn, will benefit our entire economy and spur additional investment.  (Applause.) 

Of course, as all of you know, one of the thing that would make America even more attractive to businesses and that would grow our economy and shrink our deficits, and keep this country safer, stronger, and smarter, would be a comprehensive immigration reform package.  And that’s why I’m going to continue to push and prod and poke and cajole friends in the Republican Party to get on board and help us get this done.  We need to get immigration reform done here in the United States of America.  That’s who we are.  (Applause.)

So the bottom line is this:  America is proudly open for business, and we want to make it as simple and as attractive for you to set up shop here as is possible.  That is what this summit is all about.  I hope you take full advantage of the opportunities that are here.  This is a pretty good networking session.  I can't even see the folks way out in the back.  (Laughter.)  There are a lot of deals to be done right here under this roof.  And I hope that everybody is going to take full advantage of it. 

Because we're committed to SelectUSA for the long haul.  We are committed to building partnerships with you so that our companies and our communities can thrive together.  And we intend to be with you not just today or tomorrow, but in the years and decades ahead. 

That's my commitment to you.  Because we are confident that if you invest in any of the communities that are represented here, what you will find is not only outstanding workers, and not just outstanding infrastructure, and not just an extraordinary market, and not just cheap energy, but what you will find is that the American people like doing business and they respect business, and they’re looking forward to working with you to make sure that your companies succeed, and that the faith that you place in those communities is ultimately going to result in outstanding results for your company.

Thank you very much, everybody.  Good luck.  (Applause.) ",President,Barack Obama,https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/the-press-office/2015/03/23/remarks-president-selectusa-investment-summit,,DEVELOPMENT
USA,27-09-2013,Barack Obama,"
Statement by the President","  Good afternoon, everybody.  Before I discuss the situation in Congress, let me say a few things about two important opportunities in our foreign policy. 
 
Just now, I spoke on the phone with President Rouhani of the Islamic Republic of Iran.  The two of us discussed our ongoing efforts to reach an agreement over Iran’s nuclear program.  I reiterated to President Rouhani what I said in New York -- while there will surely be important obstacles to moving forward, and success is by no means guaranteed, I believe we can reach a comprehensive solution. 
 
I’ve directed Secretary Kerry to continue pursuing this diplomatic effort with the Iranian government.  We had constructive discussions yesterday in New York with our partners -- the European Union, the United Kingdom, France, Germany, Russia and China -- together with the Iranian Foreign Minister.  Going forward, President Rouhani and I have directed our teams to continue working expeditiously, in cooperation with the P5-plus-1, to pursue an agreement.  And throughout this process, we’ll stay in close touch with our friends and allies in the region, including Israel. 
 
We’re mindful of all the challenges ahead.  The very fact that this was the first communication between an American and Iranian President since 1979 underscores the deep mistrust between our countries, but it also indicates the prospect of moving beyond that difficult history. 
 
I do believe that there is a basis for a resolution.  Iran’s Supreme Leader has issued a fatwa against the development of nuclear weapons.  President Rouhani has indicated that Iran will never develop nuclear weapons.  I have made clear that we respect the right of the Iranian people to access peaceful nuclear energy in the context of Iran meeting its obligations.  So the test will be meaningful, transparent, and verifiable actions, which can also bring relief from the comprehensive international sanctions that are currently in place.  
 
Resolving this issue, obviously, could also serve as a major step forward in a new relationship between the United States and the Islamic Republic of Iran -- one based on mutual interests and mutual respect.  It would also help facilitate a better relationship between Iran and the international community, as well as others in the region -- one that would help the Iranian people fulfill their extraordinary potential, but also help us to address other concerns that could bring greater peace and stability to the Middle East. 
 
A path to a meaningful agreement will be difficult, and at this point, both sides have significant concerns that will have to be overcome.  But I believe we’ve got a responsibility to pursue diplomacy, and that we have a unique opportunity to make progress with the new leadership in Tehran.  I also communicated to President Rouhani my deep respect for the Iranian people. 
 
As I said before, this comes on the same day that we can accomplish a major diplomatic breakthrough on Syria, as the United Nations Security Council will vote on a resolution that would require the Assad regime to put its chemical weapons under international control so they can ultimately be destroyed.  This binding resolution will ensure that the Assad regime must keep its commitments, or face consequences.  We’ll have to be vigilant about following through, but this could be a significant victory for the international community, and demonstrate how strong diplomacy can allow us to secure our country and pursue a better world.  
 
Now, America’s security and leadership don't just depend on our military strength, or our alliances, or our diplomacy.  First and foremost, America’s strength depends on a strong economy where our middle class is growing and everyone who works hard has a chance to get ahead.  So let me say a few words about the situation that’s developed over the past few weeks on Capitol Hill. 
 
Here at home, the United States Congress has two pressing responsibilities:  pass a budget on time, and pay our bills on time.  
 
If Congress chooses not to pass a budget by Monday -- the end of the fiscal year -- they will shut down the government, along with many vital services that the American people depend on.  The good news is, within the past couple of hours, the United States Senate -- Democrats and Republicans -- acted responsibly by voting to keep our government open and delivering the services the American people expect.  Now it’s up to Republicans in the House of Representatives to do the same.  I say that because obviously Democrats have a great interest in making sure that these vital services continue to help the American people.  
 
So far, the Republicans in the House of Representatives have refused to move forward.  And here’s the thing -- unlike the last time they threatened this course of action, this debate isn’t really about deficits.  In fact, our deficits are falling at the fastest pace that they have in 60 years.  By the end of this year, we will have cut our deficits by more than half since I took office.  So that’s not what this is about.  And in fact, if you’ve been following the discussion, the Republicans in the House don't even make a pretense that that’s what this is about.
 
Instead, the House Republicans are so concerned with appeasing the tea party that they’ve threatened a government shutdown or worse unless I gut or repeal the Affordable Care Act. 
 
I said this yesterday; let me repeat it:  That's not going to happen.  More than 100 million Americans currently, already have new benefits and protections under the law.  On Tuesday, about 40 million more Americans will be able to finally buy quality, affordable health care, just like anybody else.  Those marketplaces will be open for business on Tuesday no matter what -- even if there’s a government shutdown.  That’s a done deal.  
 
As I’ve said before, if Republicans have specific ideas on how to genuinely improve the law, rather than gut it, rather than delay it, rather than repeal it, I’m happy to work with them on that through the normal democratic processes.  But that will not happen under the threat of a shutdown.
 
So over the next three days, House Republicans will have to decide whether to join the Senate and keep the government open, or shut it down just because they can’t get their way on an issue that has nothing to do with the deficit. 
 
I realize that a lot of what’s taking place right now is political grandstanding.  But this grandstanding has real effects on real people.  If the government shuts down on Tuesday, military personnel -- including those risking their lives overseas for us right now -- will not get paid on time.  Federal loans for rural communities, small business owners, families buying a home will be frozen.  I’m already starting to get letters from people worried that this will have an impact on them directly.  Critical research into life-saving discoveries will be immediately halted.  
 
The federal government has a large role across the country and touches the lives of millions of people, and those people will be harmed.  And even the threat of a shutdown already is probably having a dampening effect on our economy; we saw that the last time these kinds of shenanigans were happening up on Capitol Hill.
 
So to any Republican in Congress who is currently watching, I’d encourage you to think about who you’re hurting.  There are probably young people in your office right now who came here to work for you, without much pay, because they believed that public service was noble.  You’re preparing to send them home without a paycheck.  You’ve got families with kids back in your districts who serve their country in the federal government, and now they might have to plan how they’re going to get by if you shut the government down.
 
Past shutdowns have disrupted the economy, and this shutdown would as well.  It would throw a wrench into the gears of our economy at a time when those gears have gained some traction.  And that’s why many Republican senators and many Republican governors have urged Republicans to knock it off, pass a budget, and move on.  Let’s get this done.
 
This brings me to Congress’s second responsibility.  Once they vote to keep the government open, they also have to vote within the next couple of weeks to allow the Treasury to pay the bills for the money that Congress has already spent.  I want to repeat:  Raising the debt ceiling is simply authorizing the Treasury to pay for what Congress has already authorized.  
 
Failure to meet this responsibility would be far more dangerous than a government shutdown.  It would effectively be an economic shutdown, with impacts not just here, but around the world.  We don’t fully understand what might happen, the dangers involved, because no Congress has ever actually threatened default.  But we know it would have a profound destabilizing effect on the entire economy -- on the world economy, because America is the bedrock of world investment.  The dollar is the reserve currency.  The debt that is issued by the Treasury is the foundation for our capital markets.  That’s why you don’t fool with it.
 
Now, some Republicans have suggested that unless I agree to an even longer list of demands -- not just gutting the health care law, but cutting taxes for millionaires, or rolling back rules on big banks and polluters, or other pet projects that they’d like to see and they’ve been trying to get passed over the last couple of years -- that they would push the button, throw America into default for the first time in history and risk throwing us back into a recession.
 
Now, I am willing to work with anybody who wants to have a serious conversation about our fiscal future.  I’ve demonstrated that by putting forward serious reforms to tax and entitlement programs that would bring down our long-term deficits.  I have said in the past, and I will continue to say, that I’m willing to make a whole bunch of tough decisions -- ones that may not be entirely welcomed by my own party.
 
But we’re not going to do this under the threat of blowing up the entire economy.  I will not negotiate over Congress’s responsibility to pay the bills that have already been racked up.  Voting for the Treasury to pay America’s bills is not a concession to me.  That’s not doing me a favor.  That’s simply carrying out the solemn responsibilities that come with holding office up there.  I don’t know how I can be more clear about this.  Nobody gets to threaten the full faith and credit of the United States just to extract political concessions.  No one gets to hurt our economy and millions of innocent people just because there are a couple of laws that you do not like.  
 
It has not been done in the past; we’re not going to start doing it now.  I’m not going to start setting a precedent not just for me, but for future Presidents where one chamber in Congress can basically say each time there needs to be a vote to make sure Treasury pays its bills, we’re not going to sign it unless our particular hobbyhorse gets advanced.
 
Imagine if you had a Republican President and a Democratic Speaker, and the Democratic Speaker said, well, we’re not going to pass a debt ceiling unless we raise corporate taxes by 40 percent; or unless we pass background checks on guns; or whatever other list of agenda items Democrats were interested in.  Does anybody actually think that we would be hearing from Republicans that that was acceptable behavior?  
 
That's not how our constitutional system is designed.  We are not going to do it.  The American people have worked too hard to recover from a bunch of crises -- several of them now over the last couple of years inflicted by some of the same folks in Congress that we’re talking about now -- to see extremists in Congress cause another crisis.
 
And keep in mind, by the way, this whole thing has to do with keeping the government open for a few months.  The continuing resolution -- the bill that's designed to avert a government shutdown -- basically just funds the government for another couple months so we could be doing this all over again.  I’m sure the American people are thrilled about that.
 
And that's why we’ve got to break this cycle.  My message to Congress is this:  Do not shut down the government.  Do not shut down the economy.  Pass a budget on time.  Pay our bills on time.  Refocus on the everyday concerns of the American people.  
 
There will be differences between Democrats and Republicans.  We can have all kinds of conversations about how to resolve those differences.  There will be areas where we can work together.  There will be areas where we disagree.  But do not threaten to burn the house down simply because you haven’t gotten 100 percent of your way.  That's not how our democracy is supposed to work. 
 
Every day that this goes on is another day that we’re not focused on doing what we need to be focused on, which is rebuilding this great country of ours so that our middle class is growing and everybody has got opportunity if they're willing to work hard.  That's what I’m focused on.  That's what Congress should be focused on as well.
 
Thank you very much, everybody. ",President,Barack Obama,https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/the-press-office/2013/09/27/statement-president,,OTHERS
United Kingdom,01-Jul-20,Boris Johnson,"As Israel's friend, I urge you not to annex: PM Boris Johnson","My first real experience of Israel came when I was 18, and spent several weeks working in the kitchens at kibbutz Kfar HaNassi. My fellow kibbutzniks managed to survive my contribution to their diet. I took away a profound attachment to the state of Israel. My many visits in recent years have left a deep impression – whether the solemnity and dignity of Yad Vashem, memorial to a unique crime in world history; the extraordinary gathering of world leaders for the funeral of an old friend, Shimon Peres; or cycling down Rothschild Boulevard with the Mayor of Tel Aviv, marvelling at the vibrancy of the White City. I am a passionate defender of Israel. Few causes are closer to my heart than ensuring its people are protected from the menace of terrorism and anti-Semitic incitement. The UK has always stood by Israel and its right to live as any nation should be able to, in peace and security. Our commitment to Israel’s security will be unshakeable while I am Prime Minister of the United Kingdom. So it is with sadness that I have followed the proposals to annex Palestinian territory. As a life-long friend, admirer and supporter of Israel, I am fearful that these proposals will fail in their objective of securing Israel’s borders and will be contrary to Israel’s own long-term interests. Annexation would put in jeopardy the progress that Israel has made in improving relationships with the Arab and Muslim world. I have never been more convinced that Israel’s interests overlap with those of our closest partners in the Arab world, including potential security cooperation against shared threats. But however strong their interest in a different kind of relationship with Israel, annexation would inevitably set back these opportunities and constrain potential Arab partners. Israel’s enemies would seize upon it, and use it against those in the Middle East who want to see progress. I want to see an outcome that delivers justice for both Israelis and Palestinians. The UK has often stood in a small minority at the UN in defending Israel against unwarranted and wholly disproportionate criticism. Annexation would represent a violation of international law. It would also be a gift to those who want to perpetuate the old stories about Israel. I profoundly hope that annexation does not go ahead. If it does, the UK will not recognise any changes to the 1967 lines, except those agreed between both parties. There is another way. Like many Israelis, I am frustrated that peace talks have ended in failure. While I understand the frustration felt by both sides, we must now use the energy of this moment to once more come back to the table and strive to hammer out a solution. This will require compromise on all sides. I do not underestimate the challenges in achieving lasting peace. So many efforts have been made. So many have paid the ultimate price, including of course Yitzhak Rabin. But I still believe the only way to achieve true, lasting security for Israel, the homeland for the Jewish people, is through a solution that allows justice and security for both Israelis and Palestinians. I refuse to believe that this is impossible. I welcome the commitment that President Trump has made to find a way forward. We will work tirelessly with the US - and other partners in the Arab world and Europe - to try to make peace a reality. I am immensely proud of the UK’s contribution to the birth of Israel with the 1917 Balfour Declaration. But it will remain unfinished business until there is a solution which provides justice and lasting peace for both Israelis and Palestinians. The only way it can be achieved is for both sides to return to the negotiating table. That must be our goal. Annexation would only take us further away from it.",Prime Minister,Boris Johnson,https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/as-israels-friend-i-urge-you-not-to-annex-pm-boris-johnson,,INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS

Remarks by the President to U.S. Conference of Mayors","Thank you!  (Applause.)  Hey, good to see you, Mayors.  (Applause.)  Good to see you.  All right, everybody have a seat, have a seat.  I would have thought that would bring back bad memories for Kevin, playing that song.  (Laughter.)

I want to thank Kevin for that introduction.  I have to say that that introduction is longer than my remarks, and more exciting.  (Laughter.)  So I’m feeling a little outshone here by Kevin.  But as everybody knows, Kevin has that flair about him; he did when he was a professional basketball player.  He, not surprisingly, has brought that flair to his outstanding work in Sacramento, and we’re very, very proud of him.  So I just want to thank him for his outstanding leadership, as well as the introduction.  Give Kevin a big round of applause.  (Applause.) 

I want to thank Stephanie Rawlings-Blake of Baltimore and Mayor Mick Cornett of Oklahoma City for their leadership as well.  We are very proud of them.  And I want to just thank all of you.

We’ve got -- is that playing again, Kevin?  (Laughter.)  We’ve got over 200 mayors here, representing tens of millions of Americans.  And I think as you’ve seen today, we take our partnership with you seriously because you’re often the place where change happens fastest.  That’s one of the reasons why I named -- two of my Cabinet members happen to be former mayors; a former president of this conference, Jerry Abramson of Louisville, is one of my top advisors. 

The other night, I talked about what we can do together to make sure that middle-class economics helps more Americans get ahead in the new economy.  And that’s something we want to partner with you on, as well.  And in some areas -- in fact, many areas -- we already have. 

Last year, we kicked off the Mayors’ Maker Challenge to support local entrepreneurs working to create the industries and jobs of the future.  And Mayor Greg Fischer of Louisville stepped up.  Now students and engineers are creating smarter appliances at a community space in town, and hundreds of folks are getting trained for local software development jobs.

We’ve worked with some of you to raise the minimum wage without waiting for Congress.  (Applause.)  And more than 20 cities and counties have stepped up to raise the wage since 2013.  Some have passed sick leave laws, as well, and I want to help more of you do that.  We launched the Mayors’ Challenge to End Veterans Homelessness.  And Mitch Landrieu of New Orleans stepped up.  Just a few weeks ago, New Orleans became the first major city to wipe out homelessness among veterans, and we could not be prouder of them.  Thank you.  (Applause.)  And Mayor Greg Stanton in Phoenix, Mayor Ralph Becker in Salt Lake City are closing in on that goal, as well.

We issued a My Brother’s Keeper Community Challenge to create more pathways of success for boys and young men of color, and all young people, and over 150 local and tribal leaders have stepped up.  So in Birmingham, Mayor William Bell and business leaders have created a mentoring program.  In New Haven, Mayor Toni Harp is canvassing neighborhoods along with police, teachers and firefighters to connect kids with services and support.

So that’s what mayors do.  They get things done.  They make things happen.  And on other urgent issues like responding to climate change or getting more families insured, rebuilding infrastructure, making sure that our youngest Americans get the best start in life with quality pre-K -- mayors like you are helping to get it done.  And we want to help.

So I had a chance to meet some folks earlier before I came out here, and I just emphasize to them what I always do whenever I’m at a Mayor’s Conference, and that is to emphasize that we are here in large part to make sure that you are able to achieve your goals.  Because if cities are successful, then America is going to be successful.  That’s not disrespect towards suburbs, that’s not disrespect towards rural communities.  The truth is, in every state of our union, the city and its health becomes a bellwether for how well the state as a whole is doing.  And that’s true around the world, as well. 

What we know now is that successful cities and metropolitan areas end up being the engines by which communities and states and ultimately nations, succeed.  And what I also say whenever I meet with mayors is that I have confidence in you because the fact is that you can’t afford to be ideological.  I don’t care whether you’re Republican, Democratic or independent -- the truth of the matter is folks want to make sure that their garbage is picked up, that their roads are functioning properly and traffic isn’t sucking away their days.  They want to make sure that their schools are high quality, and they want to make sure that their streets are free from crime. 

And so you don’t have the luxury of just yacking instead of doing.  (Laughter.)  Because at some point, people are going to ask, what are you getting done?  And that, in this town, is always refreshing -- (laughter) -- and I think presents enormous opportunities, which is part of the reason why our Cabinet members are always so excited to present to you what they’re doing and to find out what’s working for you.  

Because my instructions to my Cabinet over these last two years is that we want to squeeze every possible opportunity to do some good from this fourth quarter.  And a lot of stuff happens in the fourth quarter.  And one of the most promising avenues for us is to partner with you and help you do some of the terrific things you’re already doing and help you with visions of things that you want to do in the future. 

And I can guarantee you that we will not only partner with you aggressively, but we’re also going to be creative and show flexibility.  And if you have ideas that don’t neatly fit into what’s already being done, we’re going to try to come up with answers to make sure that you can succeed.

So thank you all for being here.  Thank you for the great work that you are doing.  With that, I’m going to take a couple of questions, but I think we’re going to ask our fourth estate just to step out one second so we can let our hair down, as they say.  (Laughter.)

USA,11-05-2018 00:00,Donald Trump,Remarks by President Trump on Lowering Drug Prices,"THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you very much.  Thank you.  Please.  And I want to thank Secretary Azar, Secretary Mnuchin, Secretary Ross, Ambassador Lighthizer, Commissioner Gottlieb — Scott Gottlieb has done a fantastic job.  Where is Scott?  Stand up, Scott.  Stand up.  (Applause.)  And “Right to Try” is happening, right?  You have that moving?  “Right to Try.”  So important.  Administrator Verma, Director Mulvaney for being here with us today in the beautiful Rose Garden at the White House.

We’re also honored to be joined by Senator Bill Cassidy.  Senator.  Where’s Senator Cassidy?  Please.  Please.  (Applause.)  One of my great friends, Senator Orrin Hatch.  Thank you, Orrin.  (Applause.)  Thank you.  Congressman Michael Burgess.  Michael, thank you very much.  Thank you.  Thank you, Michael.  (Applause.)  Congressman Buddy Carter.  (Applause.)  Congressman Greg Gianforte.  Hi, Greg.  (Applause.)  And numerous state officials from all over the country.

Today, my administration is launching the most sweeping action in history to lower the price of prescription drugs for the American people.  We’ve wanted to be doing this.  We’ve been working on it right from day one.  It’s been a complicated process, but not too complicated.  And today it’s happening.  We will have tougher negotiation, more competition, and much lower prices at the pharmacy counter.  And it will start to take effect very soon.

My administration has already taken significant steps to get drug prices under control.  We reformed the Drug Discount Program for safety net hospitals to save senior citizens hundreds of millions of dollars on drugs this year alone.

We’re also increasing competition and reducing regulatory burdens so drugs can be gotten to the market quicker and cheaper.  We’re very much eliminating the middlemen.  The middlemen became very, very rich.  Right?  (Applause.)  Whoever those middlemen were — and a lot of people never even figured it out — they’re rich.  They won’t be so rich anymore.

Last year, the FDA approved more than 1,000 low-cost generics, the most in history, which has already saved the American people nearly $9 billion.  Thank you, Scott.  (Applause.)

Next, we’re going to take on one of the biggest obstacles to affordable medicine: the tangled web of special interests.  Not too many are sitting here today, but they used to be here all the time.  The drug lobby is making an absolute fortune at the expense of American consumers.

No industry spends more money on lobbying than the pharmaceutical health products industry.  Last year, these companies spent nearly $280 million on lobbyists.  That’s more than tobacco, oil, and defense contractors combined.  Health insurance companies and other providers spent another $200 million to protect the status quo and to keep prices artificially high.  And they’ve been very successful doing it for many, many years.

Everyone involved in the broken system — the drug makers, insurance companies, distributors, pharmacy benefit managers, and many others — contribute to the problem.  Government has also been part of the problem because previous leaders turned a blind eye to this incredible abuse.

But under this administration, we are putting American patients first.  (Applause.)  Thank you.  I’ve instructed Secretary Azar to begin moving forward on reforms that will bring soaring drug prices back down to earth.  Our plan takes steps to derail the gravy train for special interests by ending Obamacare’s twisted incentives that actually encourage higher drug prices.

It also gives Medicare Part D plans new tools to negotiate lower prices for more drugs, and make sure that Medicare Part D incentives encourage drug companies to keep prices low.  There’s a big incentive to do that.  We are not going to reward companies that constantly raise prices, which, in the past, has been most companies.  Frankly, Alex used to run one of them — (laughter) — so nobody knows the system better than Alex.  That’s what we needed.  And a very successful one.

Our plan will end the dishonest double-dealing that allows the middleman to pocket rebates and discounts that should be passed on to consumers and patients.

Our plan bans the Pharmacist Gag Rule, which punishes pharmacists for telling patients how to save money.  (Applause.)  This is a total rip-off, and we are ending it.

We are getting tough on the drug makers that exploit our patent laws to choke out competition.  Our patent system will reward innovation, but it will not be used as a shield to protect unfair monopolies.

The FDA will also speed up the approval process for over-the-counter medicines so that patients can get more medicines without prescription.

Finally, as we demand fairness for American patients at home, we will also demand fairness overseas.  When foreign governments extort unreasonably low prices from U.S. drug makers, Americans have to pay more to subsidize the enormous cost of research and development.

In some cases, medicine that costs a few dollars in a foreign country costs hundreds of dollars in America for the same pill, with the same ingredients, in the same package, made in the same plant.  And that is unacceptable.  You can look at some of the countries; their medicine is a tiny fraction of what the medicine costs in the USA.  It’s unfair and it’s ridiculous, and it’s not going to happen any longer.  (Applause.)

It’s time to end the global freeloading once and for all.  I have directed U.S. Trade Representative Bob Lighthizer to make fixing this injustice a top priority with every trading partner.  And we have great power over the trading partners; you’re seeing that already.  America will not be cheated any longer, and especially will not be cheated by foreign countries.

The American people deserve a healthcare system that takes care of them — not one that taxes and takes advantage of our patients and our consumers and our citizens.

These reforms are just the beginning.  In the coming weeks, we will work with Congress to pass legislation that will       save Americans even more money at the pharmacy.  For that, we need the help of Congress, and we think it will be forthcoming.

We will work every day to ensure all Americans have access to the quality, affordable medication they need and they deserve.  And we will not rest until the job of unfair pricing is a total victory for the USA.  It will happen, and it’s going to happen quickly.

So thank you, again, everybody in the audience.  Thank you, Secretary Azar.

And I’d like to ask the Secretary — a very talented man — to come up and do a little explanation, because we’re going to see those prices go down.  It will be a beautiful thing to watch.  Thank you.  Mr. Secretary.  (Applause.)",President,Donald Trump,https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefings-statements/remarks-president-trump-lowering-drug-prices/,,DEVELOPMENT
USA,02-11-2021 00:00,Joe Biden,Remarks by President Biden at the “Action on Forests and Land-Use” Event,"THE PRESIDENT:  Good morning, everyone.  It’s an honor to be with you.  My fellow leaders, I’m honored to represent the United States in this important discussion.

Conserving our forests and other critical ecosystems is indispensable — an indispensable piece of keeping our climate goals within reach as well as many other key priorities that we have together: ensuring clean water, maintaining biodiversity, supporting rural and Indigenous communities, and reducing the risk of the spread of disease.

Our forests are also nature’s carbon capture, cycling CO2 out of our atmosphere.  And I want to recognize the presidents of the [Democratic] Republic of the Congo and Gabon, who are here today, for their considerable commitment to conserve — to conserve their forests.

If we all work together to make sure these precious resources are conserved in Africa and around the world, forests have the potential to reduce — reduce carbon globally by more than one third — by more than one third.  

So, we need to approach this issue with the same seriousness of purpose as decarbonizing our economies.  That’s what we’re doing in the United States.

We’ve already exceeded the 2020 Bonn Challenge goal of more than 20 million hectares of forest land under restoration thus far.

During my first week in office, I issued an executive order that set the goal of conserving at least 30 percent of all U.S. lands and waters by the year 2030.

We have put a — in place protections for the Tongass Forest in Alaska, the world’s largest intact temperate rainforest.

And today, I’m announcing a new plan to conserve global forests, which will bring together a full range of U.S. government tools — diplomatic, financial, and policy — to halt forest loss, restore our critical carbon sinks, and improve land management.

Through this plan, the United States will help the world deliver on our shared goal of halting natural forest loss and restoring at least an additional 200 million hectares of forests and other ecosystems by the year 2030.

This is a plan that is the first of its kind, taking a whole-of-government approach and working, in our case, with Congress to deploy up to $9 billion in U.S. funding through 2030 to conserve and restore our forests and mobilize billions more from our partners.

As part of this, we’re going to work to ensure markets recognize the true economic value of natural carbon sinks and motivate governments, land owners, and stakeholders to prioritize conservation.

We’ll work to align the private sector investment flows in our climate conserv- — and conservation goals, including reducing the drivers of deforestation, creating sustainable supply chains, pursuing more sustainable commodity sourcing.

At every step, we’ll work in partnership with the people most impacted by deforestation and most experienced in sustainable land management — local communities, Indigenous peoples, local governments, civil societies — to make sure our approaches are effective and focused on the needs of vulnerable populations.

Preserving forests and other ecosystems can and should play an important role in meeting our ambitious climate goals as part of the net-zero emissions strategy we all have.

And the United States is going to lead by our example at home and support other forested nations and developing countries in setting and achieving ambitious action to conserve and restore these carbon sinks.

I’m confident we can do this.  All we need to do is summon the will to do what we know is right and we know is necessary and we know is within our capacity. 

So, as simple as it sounds, I think it is this simple.  Let’s get to work.  We can do this.  And it will have a generational impact.

Thank you.  (Applause.)",President,Joe Biden,https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/speeches-remarks/2021/11/02/remarks-by-president-biden-at-the-action-on-forests-and-land-use-event/,,DEVELOPMENT
Russia,30-03-2011,Dmitry Medvedev,Meeting of the Commission for Modernisation and Technological Development of Russia’s Economy,"Colleagues,

We are meeting at one of our country’s very symbolic places today: the Magnitogorsk Iron and Steelworks. Before we turn to the main item on the agenda of today’s meeting of the Commission for Modernisation and Technological Development of Russia’s Economy, I first want to discuss another issue that I think has strategic importance for our overall economic modernisation. I want to set out my proposals on priority measures for improving our country’s investment climate. 

Achieving modernisation, which is the purpose of this Commission’s meeting, requires a major increase in investment. We need technology and we need money in amounts corresponding to Russia’s huge potential. We need the confidence and interest of Russian and foreign investors. But what do we see today? Unfortunately, we see that this confidence is lacking, to be honest about the situation. I already gave in the past my assessment of the investment climate in our country: it is very bad, very bad. 

    “There should be a major increase in investment. We need technology and we need money in amounts corresponding to Russia's huge potential.”

Business conditions for relatively small companies have not improved this year but have perhaps even worsened. This is for several reasons. As we all know, compulsory insurance payments were increased, electricity costs have gone up in most regions, and this had added to the price hikes for a number of other goods and products. Corruption continues to affect the general economic situation, maintaining a stranglehold on the entire economy, and this hold is still as strong as ever. The result is clear for all to see: money is fleeing our economy. Not as many people believe in the possibility of doing safe and successful business in Russia as we would like. Not so many businesspeople have this confidence. We cannot let this situation continue. I cannot let it continue, and nor can the Russian Federation Government.

Until we make our country attractive for business and private innovative initiatives, we will not achieve our main goal of improving the quality of life for our people. This is the goal of any state leader’s work, any government, ruling party, and regional and municipal public officer’s work. Only investment growth will enable us to build a new economy and give people the kind of creative and well-paid jobs that have been the focus of so much of our commission’s efforts. Only this will make our society richer and freer, reinforcing the material foundations of our country’s security and democratic development. 

    “I instruct the Prosecutor General to introduce a special procedure for examining complaints about state agencies' actions or inaction that contain allegations of corruption. This procedure should involve not just verifying the information, but also make it a duty to publish the results of these checks.”

I will name the package of measures which could improve the situation. This is not an exhaustive list. We will take further steps in this direction of course, including decisions on dismissals, especially with regard to those who fail to realise that ensuring good conditions for honest entrepreneurs and investors is an unquestionable priority for any public servant. We will have no choice but to dismiss those who continue to erect various barriers and obstacles, give preference to their friends, or fail to take the required action on the basis of pretended state interests that have nothing in common with our people’s interests.

These are the steps I will take in the nearest future.

First, I agree that the burden of costs involved in the need to raise pensions and finance healthcare programmes is not distributed in the best way at the moment. There never is any ideal system in this respect. We approved the scheme in place now, but this does not mean that it is fixed for once and for good, and that other decisions cannot follow in the future. The 34-percent rate that was set could indeed be too great a burden for many types of business. I therefore give the Government until June 1 to draft proposals on possibilities for lowering the compulsory insurance payments as from January 1, 2012. This will require us at the very least to cut state procurement costs and adjust the social insurance payments scale.

As a target, it would be best to set the maximum rate at something close to the old rate, but this is evidently easier said than done. I have discussed this subject many times with the Government. I spoke about it yesterday too. All of the calculations first have to be made of course, taking into account the state budget’s current obligations, and only after this can a final decision be made.

    “The Economic Development Ministry will get new powers to propose that the Justice Ministry take action to repeal state agency regulations that unjustifiably obstruct business and investment activity. The Justice Ministry will then have the duty to demand that the agencies immediately repeal the anti-business regulations in question.”

The situation is far from ideal as far as state procurement goes too. The ministries are fully capable of carrying out their planned purchases at considerably less cost, around 15 percent less on average. In fact, I think that even greater effectiveness could be achieved. I hereby give the Government until May 15 to draw up coordinated proposals on this matter. Of course all decisions in this area must make provisions for carrying out all of our obligations to raise pensions, develop healthcare, and raise service pay for people in the armed forces and law enforcement agencies. I agree with my Government colleagues that it is very important at the same time to keep the budget deficit within acceptable limits, safe limits for our country’s macroeconomic stability. It is up to the Government to decide how to do this, especially taking into account the fact that this year will probably bring us some additional revenue.

Second, I instruct the Prosecutor General, starting in May, perhaps (a draft law can be drawn up quickly), to introduce a special procedure for examining complaints about state agencies’ actions or inaction that contain allegations of corruption. This procedure should involve not just verifying the information, which is already one of the Prosecutor General’s Office’s duties, but also make it a duty to publish the results of these checks if the original information came from a public source, in other words, if the check was made at the request of a concerned party. Publication should be made using the information source, including the media, that the party making the request used. This can include newspapers, radio, television, blogs, and other types of mass communications.

If the checks confirm the information’s veracity, the guilty parties must bear liability of course, in accordance with the law. If the number of complaints about a particular agency does not fall within a certain timeframe the agency’s executives will have to take personal responsibility for their employees’ actions, and the draft law should include this in its provisions.

Third, entrepreneurs and investors constantly repeat that the authorities make it hard to do stable business because state agencies take unpredictable decisions and action. They often say, and to me too, ‘You should decide for once and for all what exactly you want, and why contradictory decisions get taken that paralyse earlier decisions’. I agree that this is a real problem in many situations, although we already have in place a procedure requiring many documents to first go through an expert evaluation at the Economic Development Ministry. Furthermore, the Federal Antimonopoly Service has the right to give instructions that must be carried out. But this is still not enough. 

The Economic Development Ministry will therefore get new powers to propose that the Justice Ministry take action to repeal state agency regulations that unjustifiably obstruct business and investment activity. The Justice Ministry for its part will then have the duty to demand that the agencies immediately repeal the anti-business regulations in question. This provision will be included in the law On the Government and other statutes, and will apply to all federal agencies without exception. The Government is already examining as it happens a draft law making it possible to lay complaints about the quality of service provided by this or that state agency, and introducing strict liability for civil servants who fail to perform their duties properly. I hope that this draft law will be examined rapidly and submitted no later than the second half of this year. This procedure has to start working.

    “There are three things we need to do to stop state companies from exerting too great an influence on the investment climate, namely, make public a timetable for privatising large government shareholdings over the next three years, end the practice of having government ministers responsible for regulation in particular sectors sitting on the boards of directors of companies operating in a competitive environment, and introduce the procedure of having major state companies make advance publication of information on their planned purchases and on the contracts already made.”

Furthermore, agencies’ regulations and instructions should be the subject of preliminary discussions with business and professional associations. This is already the case for some documents, but by no means all. The results of these discussions should be published and taken into account in approving the relevant legal acts, and also during their examination in the Economic Development Ministry.

I hereby instruct the Presidential Executive Office to draft a presidential executive order on this issue. These provisions should also be introduced at the regional and local government levels.

Fourth, starting in May, each federal district will get a special investment ombudsman, whose job will be to assist companies in carrying out private investment projects, above all, helping them in their dealings with the executive authorities. You all know that there are regions where it takes around three months to get all the necessary approvals from the moment the investor files an application. These are lucky regions with happy investors. 

The ombudsman’s job will be to make sure that these time frames are the norm throughout the whole country, and not as things were until recently in the capital and major regions, where it could take two years to get investment documents approved. This will also make it clear which regional and local officials and which federal agencies are effective, and which are not. Dismissal decisions will have to be made accordingly, based on these results.

Fifth, there are three things we need to do to stop state companies from exerting too great an influence on the investment climate. First, we should finally set and make public a timetable for privatising large government shareholdings over the next three years. Second, we must end the practice of having government ministers responsible for regulation in particular sectors sitting on the boards of directors of companies operating in a competitive environment. Third, we are to introduce the procedure of having major state companies make advance publication of information on their planned purchases, including the estimated price of the respective lots, and information on the contracts already made.

As for privatisation, this year we have to sell the state stakes in major banks and infrastructure companies, as we have already outlined. We are to get leading Russian and foreign investment banks involved in structuring these deals. The Federal Agency for Management of Federal Property must drastically improve its performance, i.e. the quality of managing state assets. I am not satisfied with the Agency’s performance in government assets management at present; its shortcomings became apparent too the day before yesterday during the videoconference on examination of how particular state assets are being managed.

On the subject of boards of directors, the Government should come up with the initiatives of passing decisions at shareholders’ meetings to replace ministers and deputy prime ministers with independent directors on the boards of the major state companies. This should be done by mid-year. 

    “The Russian direct investment fund should be set up. Its main purpose is to attract direct foreign investment. The managing team will be charged with ensuring new investment inflow at least five times bigger in volume than the fund itself.”

As far as state procurement goes, our state-owned companies spend much more as a rule than do their foreign competitors on acquiring goods, works and services. I am well aware of this fact firsthand. Unfortunately, it is often hard to put this down to anything but corruption. Our largest companies such as Transneft, Gazprom, Russian Railways, and others where government holds majority stakes must cut annual procurement costs by at least 10 percent over the next three years in terms of cost per unit of production, and this should be made one of the main criteria for assessing top managers’ performance. All who are not up to this task will have to quit their jobs.

Sixth, minority shareholders in public companies must be granted access to information on these companies’ performance, and offered mechanisms for advancing their effectiveness which meet best world standards and best practices. This requires more specific legal provisions on minority shareholders’ rights and adjustments to the existing supervisory and regulatory practices in this area, as well as changes to the operation procedures in government-controlled companies. After all, if information is being withheld from these minority shareholders it can only mean that the companies have something to hide, except for cases when information requests are linked to blatant attempts by shareholders to abuse their rights, which also happens. 

But whatever the case, any breach of minority shareholders’ rights should be seen as evidence of ineffective management. This is a job for the recently reorganised regulation and financial market supervisory body. 

    “The Government must submit a draft law to the parliament that would narrow the scope of competence of the commission which oversees transactions in so-called strategic sectors of the Russian economy accomplished by entities that are under control of foreign companies or individuals.”

Seventh, the Russian direct investment fund should be set up by mid-summer. Its main purpose is to attract direct foreign investment. The fund will be a co-investor for foreign investment funds and large companies launching investment projects of importance for Russia’s economy. The state should not take part in managing this fund and will guarantee selling its stake in these companies in 7 to 8 years’ time, perhaps a little more. The fund will be managed by a team comprising the best professionals on the investment market. As we agreed, the fund will be set up by Vnesheconombank with initial capital of at least $2 billion, which will be raised to a guaranteed $10 billion as the fund puts its project portfolio together.

The fund’s share participation in all projects should be between 10 and 25 percent. The managing team will be charged with ensuring new investment inflow at least five times bigger in volume than the fund itself. This is an ambitious task of course, but I think that given the scale of our economy this is realistic.

Eighth, the Government must submit a draft law to the parliament that would narrow the scope of competence of the commission which oversees transactions in so-called strategic sectors of the Russian economy accomplished by entities that are under control of foreign companies or individuals. The first step should involve determining the obvious exceptions from the general rules. First and foremost, this concerns transactions between entities that are already de facto controlled by Russian nationals or Russian companies, as well as transactions involving international financial organisations. The deadline for submitting this draft law is May 15 of this year.

Ninth, we must drastically improve the quality of the most common services consumed by the investment community. I am referring first and foremost to customs, the quality of service at airports, registration procedures, visa issuance procedures, work permit procedures, and postal services. I receive an enormous number of complaints about all of these issues, from both individuals and businesses, including through electronic media. And, no less importantly, I also receive complaints about the performance of the most active supervisory bodies: fire-protection, technological control and health and disease control departments.

I am hereby instructing the Government and the Presidential Executive Office to appoint from among the deputy prime ministers special supervisors for these issues within two weeks. And in six months, after they sort everything out, they will have to report on what they accomplished, if there is anything to report. In the event that there is no visible progress in these areas, they should file suggestions on changing the corresponding heads of supervisory and monitoring agencies. The outcomes of the work must be evaluated subject to the opinions of people who use those services, as well as those who are subjected to inspections. Present among us are those who conduct inspections, as well as those who are supervised.

    “The quality of the most common services consumed by the investment community must be drastically improved. This applies to customs, the quality of service at airports, registration procedures, visa issuance procedures, work permit procedures, and postal services. No less importantly, this applies to the most active supervisory bodies: fire-protection, technological control and health and disease control departments.”

Tenth and last for now, beginning in May of this year, mobile reception offices of the President of the Russian Federation will be in place. Special staff within the Presidential Executive Office must be appointed and sent to all regions to receive information from individuals and company representatives, complaints from people about the actions or inaction by authorities, and react to this information accordingly. I emphasise that these will be local representatives of the Presidential Executive Office. If required, federal, regional and local officials may be involved, and I believe unbiased review of complaints will be guaranteed by the independence of the representatives so appointed from the local authorities.

I suppose that the ten points I have just outlined are only the beginning. I am fully aware that all of this will be difficult to implement, but it is to be done, hence the efforts will be continued. I will take reports on the results achieved, and based on those reports, I will make the respective decisions. I also expect these measures to get support from the public and the business community.

Much depends on the trust of the public and the business community, and on their direct involvement in these processes, especially as all these decisions are aimed at achieving very tangible results: the creation of tens of thousands of new jobs involving the most advanced technologies which is important for releasing the potential of a great number of our people, of scientists, researchers, engineers, of all those whose problems we are to address today.

Well, with regard to engineers, I’ll list the problems that require our immediate attention.

First of all, there is insufficient coordination between educational institutions and business community. Professional or qualification standards should be urgently drafted and subsequently matched with educational standards. I have discussed that at my meetings with engineers, employers, and, just yesterday, with students. This is a challenge for both the Education Ministry, the Russian Union of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs, employers associations in various industries, and companies with government participation.

Top attention should be given to areas that we have indentified as high-priority, while long-term development prospects for every industry should be crystal-clear, otherwise there will be no point to design any new standards. I understand this is massive and cumbersome undertaking which nevertheless must be accomplished, as only then can the current disbalance be levelled out.

    “Beginning in May of this year, mobile reception offices of the President of the Russian Federation will be in place. Special staff within the Presidential Executive Office must be appointed and sent to all regions to receive complaints from people about the actions or inaction by authorities, and react to this information accordingly. Unbiased review of complaints will be guaranteed by the independence of the representatives so appointed from the local authorities.”

Second, I am hereby instructing the Government to prepare suggestions on increasing financing for training students of engineering professions. I discussed this yesterday at the Moscow Power Engineering Institute when meeting with students and faculty of technical universities.

Last year, I signed an executive order establishing presidential grants for young engineers in the defence industry. I think it would be fair to provide similar support to other bright prospect specialists, first and foremost mastering engineering in priority modernisation and technological development areas.

There are about seven million university students in the country at the moment, of whom 1.6 million study engineering. Truth be told, that figure is enormous, but at some point there should be transformation of quantity into quality, otherwise there is no reason to train specialists nobody needs. Therefore, personal grants will only be paid to the most talented and goal-oriented students, to several thousand of them. I will make a decision to this end. Finally, those who wish and can become engineers should be offered proper conditions for studying. The goal of equipping laboratories with the adequate equipment is among our top objectives.

Yesterday, the subject of building new dormitories was raised a few times. This is certainly the responsibility of the universities, but a federal budget financing should be involved as well, as this subject is a priority.

Besides, I would like to particularly note that our universities must be integrated into the international system of engineers training. We absolutely should invite lecturers from abroad, and invite those with cutting-edge international experience in engineering, so that they could bring and share their experiences here. I believe that an influx of foreign students and certainly lecturers to whatever university is a very positive factor, and should be viewed as one of the indicators of the quality of education.

    “The Government is instructed to prepare suggestions on increasing financing for training students of engineering professions.”

Third, every state university must set a supervisory board of not only university representatives, but representatives of employers and executive authorities as well. That is the only way company executives may influence policies in education, while the government may bridge the gap between education and industry. The steps to be taken at regional and federal levels should be identified. I just discussed the topic with the Chelyabinsk Region Governor [Mikhail Yurevich], and I believe the regions should be granted additional powers in regulating universities.

We have reviewed the issue of coordination between technical universities and defence industries and therefore it should be thoroughly examined how educational programmes meet the needs of re-equipping national Armed Forces. This is particularly relevant given the growth in our defence spending which, as you know, is significant. Universities must actively promote implementation of research, development and design works within the defence procurements. There are lots of interesting and fundamental challenges in research and engineering to be addressed.

The last issue on today’s engineering agenda is the need to improve the technical equipment and teaching methods at engineering universities. I am absolutely certain that technical universities should be entirely technical with no unrelated subjects, so that the universities which intend to offer training in various professions should either close down as a technical institution or become liberal arts colleges.

Every college and university claiming their ability to train engineers should undergo a certification. I was, by the way, much surprised to learn that in today’s diplomas a qualifying profession is never stated as ‘engineer’. I therefore fail to understand what are the specialists trained then? What, then, are they?

Reply: Professionals.

    “Those who wish and can become engineers should be offered proper conditions for studying.”

Dmitry Medvedev: Professionals. When meeting with the students yesterday, I once again told them that engineers in other countries are proud of their degree and title while we, due to, possibly, some specific attitudes to the engineering professions shaped during the 1990s, have even removed the qualification [of an engineer from the diplomas] which, I think, hardly takes some of the blame [for the public attitudes] off the universities, but definitely fails to boost prestige of this esteemed profession, as should be admitted, because it is even named in a shy-away manner.

This is my list of engineering priorities. But we all, including the colleagues here, have worked over the past month to draft and review various significant suggestions and to issue a package of instructions, and I therefore propose that we devote some extra time to this issue.

Let us proceed as follows. In light of the above, I want the Economic Development Minister to comment on the outline given and the instructions issued, since my approaches to improving the investment climate were preliminarily discussed with the Economic Development Ministry.

After that, I expect comments from those who have something to add on the engineering agenda, the points not covered at the meetings I have chaired. I am referring to employers and university rectors present here.

Finally, the ministers will make their brief comments. As they have already spoken and shared their views, that, I think, would be fair.

This will be our agenda.",President,Dmitry Medvedev,http://en.kremlin.ru/events/president/transcripts/statements/10777,,OTHERS
USA,05-06-2021 00:00,Joe Biden,Statement by President Joe Biden Recognizing the 40th Year of the HIV/AIDS Epidemic,"Forty years ago today, five young men in Los Angeles were confirmed as the first known patients stricken with an illness that the world would later come to know as AIDS. In the decades since, more than 700,000 Americans and 32.7 million people worldwide have been lost to AIDS-related illnesses – a heartbreaking human toll that has disproportionately devastated LGBTQ+ communities, communities of color, and underserved and marginalized people around the world.

On the 40th year of the HIV/AIDS epidemic, we remember the lives that were cut short by this terrible disease – including so many whose pain went unacknowledged for far too long. We also celebrate the resilience and dignity of the over 38 million people worldwide, including approximately 1.2 million Americans, living with HIV.

Thanks to the tireless dedication of activists, scientific researchers, and medical professionals, we have made tremendous progress to advance HIV research, prevention, treatment, and care. And after years of neglect, discrimination, fear-mongering, and limited action by government officials and the public, America has grown to become a leading force in the fight to end the HIV crisis. Through the President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief – and as the largest donor to the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria – the U.S. has invested more than $85 billion since 2002 to support HIV programs around the world, including $250 million provided in my American Rescue Plan to address the impacts of COVID-19 on our progress in the fight against HIV. All told, these efforts are estimated to have saved more than 20 million lives globally. To help accelerate and strengthen our efforts to end the HIV epidemic in the United States, I have requested $670 million from Congress, an increase of $267 million over previous levels, to aggressively reduce new HIV cases by increasing access to treatment, expanding the use of preexposure prophylaxis (PrEP), and ensuring equitable access to services free from stigma and discrimination.

Despite the progress we’ve made, our work is not yet finished. In honor of all those we have lost and all those living with the virus – and the selfless caregivers, advocates, and loved ones who have helped carry the burden of this crisis – we must rededicate ourselves to reducing HIV infections and AIDS-related deaths. We must continue empowering researchers, scientists, and health care providers to ensure equitable access to prevention, care, and treatment in every community – particularly for communities of color and the LGBTQ+ community. And we must provide moral leadership to eradicate the stigma and discrimination still faced by those living with HIV, rededicating ourselves to continuing the vital work of ending this epidemic once and for all.

China,08-10-2013 00:00,Xi Jinping,Give Full Play to the Leading Role of the Asia-Pacific Maintain and Advance an Open World Economy,"Dr. Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono, President of the Republic of Indonesia,
Dear Colleagues,

It is a great pleasure for me to discuss with you the world economy and the future of Asia-Pacific cooperation on this beautiful island of Bali. Let me first of all express my sincere thanks to you, President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono and the Indonesian government, for making thoughtful arrangements for this meeting.

The world economy is on the whole moving forward in a positive direction, yet uncertainties and destabilizing factors have remained prominent. The underlying impact of the international financial crisis is still there, and cross-border financial risks must not be left unheeded. The structural problems of major developed economies are far from being resolved, and it has become more imperative to enhance macro-economic policy coordination. With growing external risks and pressure, some emerging economies in the Asia-Pacific are experiencing turbulence in the financial markets and slowdown of economic growth. With slow progress in the WTO Doha Round negotiations, trade and investment protectionism has resurfaced. The world economy faces daunting challenges before achieving full recovery and sound growth.

APEC, which is entrusted with the important mission to promote regional and global growth, must face the challenges head-on with courage and resolve. It should play a leading and coordinating role in maintaining and advancing an open world economy, and in making sure that the Asia-Pacific continues to serve as an engine for global economic recovery.

First, work together for the common development of the Asia-Pacific through increased macro-economic policy coordination. With our economies all closely intertwined in economic globalization, we must amplify the positive effects of macro-economic policy coordination while preventing or reducing the negative spillovers. We must pursue win-win cooperation in an open and inclusive spirit. Our efforts should not be uncoordinated or even cancel each other out. Major reserve currency issuing economies should implement responsible macro-economic policies. They should act cautiously in adjusting their policies, monetary policies in particular. Be it the adoption or withdrawal of a policy, they must take into account its possible impact on the region and increase communication and coordination with other economies.

APEC should play a similar role in promoting an open environment for development in the Asia-Pacific, featuring policy coordination, interconnected growth and converging interests.

Second, maintain economic and financial stability in the Asia-Pacific through factual assessment of the situation and cool-headed response to the challenges. World economic fluctuations have brought challenges to the financial market, capital flow and exchange rate stability in the Asia-Pacific, exposing the region to more economic and financial risks. We must prevent risks from piling up and causing major economic and financial turbulence in the Asia-Pacific. We must support economic policies with social policies to prevent economic and financial risks from developing into political and social problems.

Having said that, we recognize that the Asia-Pacific region's common aspiration for peace, stability and development has not changed, nor has the historical trend of its growing status and role in the world political and economic landscape, or the driving force and potential for its rapid and sustained economic growth. Asia-Pacific economies have learned lessons from their past experience and significantly enhanced their capabilities to fend off risks. We have every reason to be confident about the future of this region.

Third, take a long-term perspective, promote profound economic restructuring by member economies and give stronger impetus to the sustained development of the Asia-Pacific. If we do not plan for the future, we will have immediate worries. While addressing problems at hand, it is all the more necessary to plan for the future. The key to long-term development lies in reform and innovation. We must transform the current economic development model, adjust economic structures, advance reform and innovation, and release the potential of domestic demand, the impetus of innovation and the vitality of the market, so as to provide internal driving force for sustained and sound economic development. Reform is never smooth sailing. All member economies, both developed and developing, should be prepared to bear necessary costs for reform. The inherent difficulty of reform entails extraordinary courage, and only persistent efforts befit this commendable cause.

Asia-Pacific economies should accelerate readjustment of their respective economic structures and deepen the integration of the industrial chain and the value chain so that the Asia-Pacific will take the lead globally in forming new industrial clusters for growth and continue to serve as an important engine for the world economy.

Dear Colleagues,

The Ninth WTO Ministerial Conference to be held in two months will have an important impact on the destiny of the Doha Round negotiations and the multilateral trading system. In the meantime, the various free trade arrangements in the region are advancing in parallel, each with different rules, standards and preferred pathway. Here, I wish to propose the following:

First, promote economic integration of the Asia-Pacific through synergy. China is open to all institutional arrangements that are conducive to Asia-Pacific regional integration. China also believes that any arrangement should lead to a cooperative relationship, not a confrontational one, an open mindset, not an exclusive one, win-win results, not a zero-sum outcome, and integration, not fragmentation. We must foster a culture of integration and complementarity through mutual learning and reinforcement.

APEC members should embrace the principles of openness, inclusiveness and transparency and the spirit of flexibility, establish and launch as early as possible an information exchange mechanism for free trade areas. APEC should play a leading and coordinating role. Regional free trade arrangements should keep APEC leaders informed of the progress made in their negotiations and results achieved in this regard, and improve communication and exchange of views to create favorable conditions for the eventual realization of a free trade area of the Asia Pacific (FTAAP).

Second, stay committed to open development and resolutely oppose trade protectionism. Economies prosper in openness and falter in isolation. This year's meeting has come back to the birthplace of the Bogor Goals and is therefore of special significance. We must stay committed to the spirit of the Bogor Goals and to open regionalism. One should not just sweep the snow in front of his own home and ignore the frost on the roof of his neighbor. The developed members should set a good example in opening their markets wider, give higher priority to economic and technical cooperation, and help developing members enhance their competitiveness.

Third, inject new impetus to multilateral trading regime with firm confidence. APEC has been a staunch supporter of the Doha Round negotiations, just as it had played an important role in concluding the Uruguay Round. Standing at a similar historical moment, we must have the courage to assume our responsibilities and send a strong political signal for advancing the Doha Round negotiations. We should give our trade ministers more political guidance and flexibility, and encourage the parties to achieve an early harvest, work for the full conclusion of the Doha Round with strong determination, and develop a roadmap for this purpose.

Dear Colleagues,

APEC is now entering another development stage. At this new historical starting point, let us work together in the spirit of openness, inclusiveness, cooperation and mutual benefit and enable APEC to play an even greater role.

Thank you.",President,Xi Jinping,https://www.fmprc.gov.cn/mfa_eng/wjdt_665385/zyjh_665391/t1088516.shtml,,DEVELOPMENT
USA,12-01-2021 00:00,Donald Trump,"Remarks by President Trump at the 45th Mile of New Border Wall | Reynosa-McAllen, TX","THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you very much.  Thank you, everybody.  Great honor to be here.  We worked long and hard.  Please sit down.  We’ve worked long and hard to get this done.  They said it couldn’t be done, and we got it done.  One of the largest infrastructure projects in the history of our country.

I’m honored to be here in the Rio Grande Valley with the courageous men and women of Customs and Border Patrol.  These people are incredible.  They’re really incredible.  I’ve gotten to know you very well over the last four years.  Many of you are friends from all of the work we did in designing the wall.  We got it exactly as you wanted it — everything — including your protective plate on top.  I’d say, “Why did we put that?”  And they said, “We need it for extra protection.”  Climb plate.  And we have everything you want.  It’s steel.  It’s concrete inside the steel.  And then it’s rebar — a lot of heavy rebar inside the concrete.  And it’s as strong as you’re going to get and strong as you can have.  But we gave you 100 percent of what you wanted.  So now you have no excuses.  I didn’t want you to have any excuses.  (Laughter.)

And you set records.  And we can’t let the next administration even think about taking it down, if you can believe that.  I don’t think that will happen.  I think when you see what it does and how it’s so important for our country, nobody is going to be touching it.  And you are very proud of it, and you’re proud of the work you did, because we really designed it together.

We’re joined together to celebrate a great achievement: the extraordinarily successful building of the wall on the southern border.

Before we begin, I’d like to say that free speech is under assault like never before.  The 25th Amendment is of zero risk to me but will come back to haunt Joe Biden and the Biden administration.  As the expression goes: Be careful what you wish for.  The impeachment hoax is a continuation of the greatest and most vicious witch hunt in the history of our country, and it is causing tremendous anger and division and pain — far greater than most people will ever understand, which is very dangerous for the USA, especially at this very tender time.

And now I’d like to briefly address the events of last week.  Millions of our citizens watched on Wednesday as a mob stormed the Capitol and trashed the halls of government.  As I have consistently said throughout my administration, we believe in respecting America’s history and traditions, not tearing them down.  We believe in the rule of law, not in violence or rioting.

Because of the pandemic — horrible, horrible invisible enemy — and despite our tremendous success developing a vaccine years before it was thought evenly remotely possible.  Nobody thought it was going to be possible.  They said would take five years.  “Sir, it will take seven years.”  All of our scientists were saying — our advisors, “It will take 7 years, 5 years, 10 years maybe.”  Well, we did it just like I said we would.  And we had it out years and years before they thought it was possible.  And we’re now delivering it to states, including your state, where your governor and government are doing a terrific job in getting it administered in Texas.  And Florida is doing great.  Some of them are doing great.  Some aren’t doing as well, but they have all they can handle.  And we get it to them as fast as they need it, and even faster.

But they’re calling it a “medical miracle.”  And this has been a difficult year and a very difficult election.  The pandemic has made it a very, very difficult year for our country and virtually every country all over the world.

Now is the time for our nation to heal, and it’s time for peace and for calm.  Respect for law enforcement and the great people within law enforcement — so many are here — is the foundation of the MAGA agenda.  And we’re a nation of law, and we’re a nation of order.  That is why we’re here today, to talk about what we must do to uphold the rule of law in America and how we must continue to support our law enforcement heroes, which is exactly what you are.  Do you feel like a hero?  Yeah, I think you do.  Right?  (Applause.)  You do and you are.

I want to thank Customs and Border Patrol Commissioner Mark Morgan, who’s been incredible.  Where is Mark?  Mark?  Stand up, Mark.  Great job.  Fantastic.  (Applause.)

Chief Patrol Agent Brian Hastings.  Brian, thank you very much.  Great job.  (Applause.)  He’s so happy with it.  He said, “Sir, this really works.”

And most importantly, the brave law enforcement officers who risk their lives every day to protect our families and our country.

I also want to thank a tremendous gentleman, a friend of mine, Tom Homan.  He’s a great American patriot, and he was with us right from the beginning.  (Applause.)  Right, Tom?  You knew exactly — he said, “We need a wall,” when they were saying, “No, no, we need drones.  We need drones.”  I said, “Why?  So you can watch the people pour into our country illegally?”  And I want to thank you very much, Tom.  What a — what a professional job you’ve done.

All of you people, incredible.  Everyone here today is part of an incredible success story.  This is a real success story.

When I took office, we inherited a broken, dysfunctional, and open border.  Everybody was pouring in at will.

Working alongside the heroes in this great outdoor space, looking at our wall, we reformed our immigration system and achieved the most secure southern border in U.S. history.  It is at a level that it’s never been before.

We took on the cartels, the coyotes, and the special interests, and we restored the rule of law.  For years, politicians ran for office promising to secure the border, only to get elected and to do the absolute exact opposite.  They even promised a wall.  If you remember, about 10 years ago, they promised a wall but they couldn’t get it built.  It wasn’t easy getting it built.  Getting it financed was tough.  Getting it built was even tougher.  All the different chains of title and all the different things we had to go through — very, very complex and very difficult, but we got it done.  But they had it years ago.  You remember that better than anybody.  Right?  And they never got it done.  They never, ever completed the task.  And then, ultimately, the money was sent back to the federal government.  Spent, but no wall was built.

But unlike those who came before me, I kept my promises.  And today we celebrate an extraordinary milestone: the completion of the promised 450 miles of border wall.  Four hundred and fifty miles.  Nobody realizes how big that is.  (Applause.)

I remember when I first came down, about a year and a half ago: We’re under construction, and I started walking, and I’m looking at the wall, and I’m walking and walking.  And I’m used to, like, a development project where you could walk a wall.  You know, 10 acres, 5 acres, 2 acres, 1 acre.  Then I realized that’s a long time; that’s a big walk.  A lot of it — a lot of the wall you have is incredibly natural.  It’s — you have the mountains.  You have the rivers.  You have some very powerful water areas.  You have some areas that are virtually impossible to get by.  So we didn’t need walls everywhere, but where we needed them — because it’s been so successful that we’ve added nearly 300 miles.  And that’s currently under construction.  This was our original wish: to get these areas done where it was such trouble.  And now we have it.  It’s either in construction or pre-construction — an additional 300 miles.

In every region that we’ve built the wall, illegal crossings and drug smuggling have plummeted.  Absolutely plummeted.  In the Rio Grande Valley, crossings have dropped nearly 80 percent.  In Yuma, Arizona, illegal entries have been slashed by 90 percent.  Nationwide, ICE and Border Patrol have seized over 2 million pounds of fentanyl, heroin, meth, and other deadly narcotics, saving thousands and thousands of lives.

We’ve arrested nearly 500,000 illegal aliens with criminal records — some with very serious criminal records of the type you don’t want to know about, like murder.

We removed nearly 20,000 gang members from the United States, including 4,500 members of MS-13 — probably the worst gang of them all.  Through the landmark reforms we’ve put into place, we have ended the immigration chaos and reestablished American sovereignty.  Our most important reform was ending catch and release — not easy to do; you’re dealing with Congress; it’s very, very difficult — which is the functional equivalent of open borders, but even worse: It’s catch and release them.  It means release into our country, not into another country.

This policy was exploited by vicious criminal organizations, who understood the laws better than our people understood them for years, to spread misery and suffering and drugs all across the hemisphere.

Now, instead of “catch and release,” we have “detain and remove.”  It’s called “detain and remove.”  Doesn’t that sound better?  One of the biggest loopholes we closed was asylum fraud.  Under the old, broken system, if you merely requested asylum, you were released into the country.  The most ridiculous thing anyone has ever seen.  And we were taking in some people that you didn’t want to have in your country.

We instituted a series of historic policy changes to shut down asylum fraud, and that’s what we did.  This includes the groundbreaking agreement with Mexico known as the “Migrant Protection Protocols,” or MPP.

Under this agreement, if an illegal alien requests asylum, they have to wait in Mexico until their case is heard.  They used to wait here.  And when they were waiting, they would say “bye-bye,” and they’d disappear somewhere into our country, and essentially we’d never find them again, would never see them again.

This one measure alone ended a humanitarian crisis and saved countless lives, and especially, I have to say, lives from crime.

I want to thank the great President of Mexico.  He is a great gentleman, a friend of mine.  And President Obrador — he is a man who really knows what’s happening.  And he loves his country, and he also loves the United States.  But I want to thank for his friendship and his professional working relationship.

We actually had 27,000 Mexican soldiers guarding our borders over the last two years.  Nobody thought that was possible.  And they made it very, very difficult, and that’s why the numbers were able to plunge, even during the construction of the wall.

And, by the way, one of the big elements of the wall that make it so successful is we can have far fewer people working.  Now, they can be working on other things — other things related to crime and drug prevention and a lot of other elements they’re working on, because we saved massive numbers of people.  And included here we have the most sophisticated camera systems and most sophisticated electronic systems anywhere in the world.

We implemented three historic agreements with the Northern Triangle; that’s Guatemala, Honduras, and El Salvador.  Under these critical asylum cooperation agreements, the burden of illegal immigration is now shared all across the region.  Now, when an illegal immigrant is arrested at our border, they can be sent to a neighboring country instead of into a U.S. community.

Prior to my getting here, countries wouldn’t accept them.  They would say, “No, no, no.”  I said, “Well, you got to take them.”  First month — I’ll never forget — these gentlemen, right here, came to me.  They said, “They won’t take them back.”

They came.  They may be murderers.  They may be cartel heads.  They may be some really vicious people.  The countries didn’t want them back.  And I stopped all payments to those countries.  I stopped everything going to those countries.  And after it was stopped for about a month — you remember? — after it was stopped for about a month, they called.  They said, “We’d love to have them back.”  And I never gave them as much money as they were getting, by the way, but they got some.  (Applause.) It was amazing.

And you people know better than anyone: They wouldn’t take them back.  We’d have planes flying over, loaded up with people that we didn’t want here.  And they’d say, “Don’t ever even think about landing that plane.”  And they’d take them by boat, and they’d take them by bus, and they wouldn’t let them into their countries.  And all of a sudden, they say, “Welcome back.  We love having you.”

So it was a great thing.  And now they do take them back.  And the relationship with those countries — the Triangle — the relationship is a much better one than it was before.

In addition to our agreements with Mexico, Guatemala, Honduras, and El Salvador, we have systematically reformed the regulatory code to return asylum to its original legal meaning and purpose — not a free ticket for entry.

A recent comprehensive report by the Department of Homeland Security and Justice show how effective our reforms have been and how disastrous their removal would be.  It would be a disaster for our country.  I know they’re thinking about removing them.  I hope they don’t do that.  I hope they don’t do that.  It’ll be a absolute travesty for our country.

The report conclusively proves, once and for all, that aliens released at the border remain at large in the country and do not return home.  They won’t go home.  And you rarely find them.  It’s very tough to find them.

So we have aliens released in our country, many of whom are serious criminals.  And we’ve stopped that.  Don’t ever start that process again.  By contrast, under our policies, 98 percent of aliens that remain in DHS custody are removed.  Simply put, if you enter the United States illegally, you are apprehended and immediately safely removed from our country.  Without this core principle, there is no border, there is no law, there is no order.

My administration also instituted vital public health measures on the border.  In response to the China virus, under Title 42 of the U.S. Code, illegal immigrants are being promptly removed to protect the health of border agents, other migrants, and local communities, and the public at large.  Removing these protections would invite a public health catastrophe of epic proportions.

As you probably know, in Tijuana, various parts of Mexico, the COVID — it’s got about 24 names I can call it, from “COVID” to “China virus.”  I can call it the “plague.”  I call it the “China plague.”  A lot of different names.  But we always call it the “invisible enemy.”  But the invisible enemy has been very tough on Mexico, and we have areas along the border where we’re in great shape because right there, because of that, that we’re in great shape.  But on the other side, in Mexico, they’re suffering greatly with the virus.  It’s been incredible what we’ve achieved.  And we didn’t do the wall because of COVID; we did the wall because of security and drugs and other things.  But it turned out that, in the middle of it all, along came this horrible plague.

We inherited a dangerously lawless border.  The people that work here are unbelievably brave.  I’ve seen what they have to endure, what they have to go through.  They’re tough, they’re strong, and they’re great patriots, great Americans.

We fixed it and we secured it.  We empowered our wonderful ICE and Border Patrol to fulfill their oaths and sworn officers.  They became sworn officers of the law.  And they love their job.  It’s a tough job.  It’s a nasty job.  They’re not paid what they should be paid, to be honest, but we got you up.  We got you up.  But these are incredibly talented people that could probably do a lot better, in terms of economics, than they do here.  But they love what they do, and they love their country.

We also put into place vital measures to protect American workers, keep out terrorists, and stop the abuse of our welfare system — where they’d come up, go on our welfare system, and live for years on American welfare without ever having a job.

We also have, and we had — but we have them all the time — we have terrorists from the Middle East coming into our country through the southern border.  That was before what you see right here, because it was easier to come into our country through the southern border than it was through airports or any other means.  So they’d land in South America, and they’d work their way up, and they’d come into our country.  And these are not people from the countries that you would suspect.  These are people from some very seriously dangerous places in the Middle East.  And the numbers are far greater than anybody would understand.  Really far greater.

Removing any of these measures would hamstring our workers, endanger our country, and cost taxpayers hundreds of billions of dollars a year.

No matter our party, we should all agree on the need to protect our workers, our families, and our citizens of all backgrounds, no matter who they are.  In particular, if our border security measures are reversed, it will trigger a tidal wave of illegal immigration — a wave like you’ve never seen before.  And I can tell you that, already, waves are starting to come up from 2,000 and 1,000 and 500 miles away.  We see what’s coming.

And they’re coming because they think that it’s gravy train at the end; it’s going to be a gravy train.  Change the name from the “caravans,” which I think we came up with, to the “gravy train,” because that’s what they’re looking for — looking for the gravy.

This will be an unmitigated calamity for national security, public safety, and public health.  It would destroy millions and millions of jobs and claim thousands of innocent lives.  The policies I put into place are uniformly and strongly supported by the men and women of ICE and Border Patrol.  We worked on them together, just like we did on the wall.  We worked on the policies together because nobody knows this whole world better than the incredible people right in front of me.  To terminate those policies is knowingly to put America in really serious danger and to override the great career experts that have worked so hard — those from DHS.

At this very moment, smugglers and coyotes are preparing to surge the border if our policies are loosened or removed.  I mean, they’re literally waiting — big, big groups of people.  Some of them very unsavory, I might add.

This is an entirely preventable tragedy.  It’s waiting to happen.  The safety of our nation must come before politics.  We have many disagreements in the country, but we should all agree: the urgent need to secure our borders, protect our homeland, and allow law enforcement to fulfill its mission without political interference.

ICE and Border Patrol agents swore a sacred oath to uphold the law, and no political appointee should ever order them to violate that oath.  These are real experts.  They really get it.

And I’ll tell you who else gets it: The Hispanic population of our country gets it.  Because not only did I win Texas in historic numbers, but I won border towns, which are largely Hispanic, and people were amazed to see that.  And the numbers, they say, were — the Governor of Texas called — Greg — great guy, great governor — called.  He said, “You had numbers that nobody has had since Reconstruction.  “Reconstruction” means “Civil War.”  And largely Hispanic.  They understand it better than anybody, and they want law enforcement to help them — help them live safe lives.

The laws that Congress passed must be upheld.  To the men and women of ICE, Customs and Border Protection, and all across DHS, law enforcement in general: You have earned the everlasting gratitude of our nation.  You have no idea how much our nation loves you and respects you.  I don’t think you do have an idea, but it’s true.  I only hope and pray that your voice will be heard, honored, heeded, and respected long into the future.

God bless you.  God bless law enforcement.  And God bless America.  Thank you very much.  Thank you.  Great job.  (Applause.)",President,Donald Trump,https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefings-statements/remarks-president-trump-45th-mile-new-border-wall-reynosa-mcallen-tx/,,EXTREMISM

She is doing fantastically well. (Applause.) And we’re also joined, of course, by Florida Attorney General, highly respected, Pam Bondi. So I want to thank you, Pam. Thank you. (Applause.)

Elaine Chao, our Secretary of Transportation, who’s a real expert. She was Secretary of Labor, but she said, I really wanted to be Secretary of Transportation. That’s a real expertise, and she’s doing incredibly. She would have been here, but she’s celebrating the 50th anniversary of the Department of Transportation right now as we speak. And we’re going to work on infrastructure and we’re going to put up one of the big and great infrastructure bills of all time. (Applause.) We’re going to get our infrastructure fixed in our country, and we’re going to rebuild our country, and that’s what we need. Lots of jobs, also. (Applause.)

And I want to thank Ford — you saw their big announcement yesterday. And so many others are announcing tremendous numbers of jobs. (Applause.) They’re not leaving our country anymore, folks. They’re not leaving; they’re staying and they’re building right here.

So we really have these incredibly strong and dedicated leaders, and they’re with me and they’re with us. And I’m very happy about it. And I want to thank you as being representative, very much, of our group. Thank you all very much. Thank you. (Applause.)

And I’m so proud that the White House and our administration is filled with so many women of such incredible talent. This week, as we conclude Women’s History Month, we honor a great woman of American history. Since the very beginning, women have driven — and I mean each generation of Americans — toward a more free and more prosperous future.

Among these patriots are women like the legendary Abigail Adams — right? — (applause) — who, during the founding, urged her husband to remember the rights of women. She was very much a pioneer in that way.

We’ve been blessed with courageous heroes like Harriet Tubman, who escaped slavery — (applause) — and went on to deliver hundreds of others to freedom, first on the Underground Railroad, and then as a spy for the Union Army. She was very, very courageous, believe me. (Applause.)

And we’ve had leaders like Susan B. Anthony — have you heard of Susan B. Anthony? — (laughter) — I’m shocked that you’ve heard of her — who dreamed of a much more equal and fair future, an America where women themselves, as she said, “helped to make laws and elect the lawmakers.” And that’s what’s happening more and more. Tough competition out there, I want to tell you.

From the untamed frontiers of the Western Plains to the skyscrapers of Manhattan, American women in every generation have shown extraordinary grit, courage, and devotion. Our present generation stands on the shoulders of these titans — and that’s what they were and are — titans. Only by enlisting the full potential of women in our society will we be truly able to — you have not heard this expression before — make America great again. (Laughter and applause.) It’s a good expression. (Applause.)

Thank you. Thank you, everybody. Thank you. It’s been a lot of fun. (Laughter.) And we didn’t get that one from Madison Avenue, right? (Laughter.)

My administration will work every day to ensure that our economy is a place where women can work, succeed, and thrive like never before. That includes fighting to make sure that all mothers and all families have access to affordable childcare. (Applause.)

We want every daughter in America to grow up in a country where she can believe in herself, believe in her future, and follow her heart and realize her dreams. (Applause.)

And we want a country that celebrates family, that celebrates community, and that creates a safe and loving home for every child — every child. That’s what we want. (Applause.)

Earlier this year, I met with a remarkable group of leaders. They were women entrepreneurs from all across the country. They started their businesses from absolutely nothing, and today have grown them into successful enterprises that employ hundreds — and in certain cases, even thousands — of people. Just think of what our country could achieve if we unleashed the power of women entrepreneurs nationwide. Think of that. (Applause.)

So, as a man, I stand before you as President. But if I weren’t President, I wouldn’t be happy to hear that statement. That would be a very scary statement to me because there’s no way we can compete with you. (Laughter.) So I would not be happy. (Applause.) Just wouldn’t be happy.

One of the business owners I met, Lisa Phillips, used to be homeless. She now is the owner of an event-planning company, and she trains homeless youth in Baltimore for good-paying jobs. Lisa had a message for all of us. As she put it, “This is a country of chances…if you’re willing to work hard, you’ll get the chance.” And she means it, and she’s become very successful. She’s terrific.

Lisa is right — but we have to fight to ensure that more people have the chance to succeed. To do that, we must believe in each other, and we must dare to dream of a better, brighter, and more prosperous future for all of our citizens. We have no choice. That’s what we have to do.

And to be honest, whether you’re a woman or whether you’re a man, you have that same dream: You want to be able to dream. You just have a big advantage over us. (Laughter.) You know why? Right there. (Applause.) There’s a lot of truth to that, Mike, right?

That’s what I want for each and every one, and each and every one of our daughters and our granddaughters. And I know, together, we will get there. I want every young person in the audience today, and watching from home — and they’re all over the place; those cameras are all over — (laughter) — to know that the future truly belongs to you. We are Americans, and we will not stop until we have achieved our dreams.

I want to thank you very much for being here. It’s my great honor, I will tell you, to be here. In fact, Melania said, this is something I just have to be at. She feels so strongly about it. She feels so strongly about it. (Applause.)

So thank you, God bless you, and God bless America. Thank you very much. Thank you. (Applause.)",President,Donald Trump,https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefings-statements/remarks-president-trump-womens-empowerment-panel/,,OTHERS
Russia,07-02-2002 00:00,Vladimir Putin,"Extracts from Opening Remarks at a Meeting with the Presidium of the Central Council of the Russian Agrarian Movement, a national non-governmental organisation","Good afternoon.

As you know, the Russian agro-industrial sector has been showing some, if only timid, signs of improvement. Witness the overall growth of agricultural output and the drop of the number of loss-making enterprises. Advanced technologies are being introduced and investment is increasing. If these trends hold, the agribusiness will cease to be a traditional headache and start turning into a dynamic sector of the economy. So, I think it is extremely important to reveal and consolidate the positive trends, to identify these positive trends and properly use the points of growth that have emerged.

Reviving the agro-industrial sector is a key pre-requisite for bringing about an upsurge of the national economy as a whole, but equally important, it is an issue of the future opportunities and the way of life of millions of our fellow citizens.

Today it is particularly important to introduce new and modern forms of economic management that contribute to effective interaction between all the links in the production chain, beginning with financing, to production, processing and sales.

Undoubtedly, not only the agents in the agro-industrial sector, but the government, too, each have to do their share of the work. Both the federal and the regional authorities must contribute to the creation of large integrated complexes, find ways to insure against agrarian risks, promote the development of leasing schemes and generally provide incentives for the use of the most suitable, the most advanced methods of farming.

The growth of agricultural production is still unfortunately impeded by administrative barriers. A poorly developed market infrastructure and a lack of an advanced legal framework are other obstacles. During the past two years we have made significant progress in the sphere of land legislation. The Land Code has come into force and most recently the law on the sale and purchase of agricultural land has been passed. I would like to note that we have managed to take into account both the national interest and the regional specifics – and I expect to hear your opinions about it. The law identifies the issue of rent as one of the most common current forms of land use.

<…>

I would like to dwell on the undoubtedly important topic of protecting the domestic farmer. Now that Russia is preparing to become a fully-fledged member of the WTO that topic takes on added importance. We know very well that the countries of Europe, the United States and our other foreign partners zealously guard the interests of their domestic producers. We too must work out our strategy and tactics in order to take into account the interests of our agro-industrial sector in the WTO negotiating process. But here it is important, and I think many will agree with me, to strike the right balance. A lack of competition and the creation of sheltered conditions for the domestic agricultural sector will do no good.

Reverting to an inefficient system of subsidies is a recipe for stagnation. These subsidies, of course, can keep production afloat but will certainly not contribute to the development ofagribusiness. Having said that, I am aware thatthis is a very pressing issue for the development of any sector of the economy, but especially for agriculture, for the farmer. Our partners have worked out a whole system for protecting their own interests. I have publicly commented on this more than once: the more we are integrated into the European and world economy, the more frequently we confront theissue of protecting our national interests through administrative, absolutely non-market methods, whatever they may be called. This does not mean that we should in all cases proceed on a quid pro quo basis, but we must always keep in mind our own interests and the interests of our producers. That is true.

China,28-04-2020 00:00,H.E. Wang Yi,Deepening BRICS Cooperation to Combat COVID-19,"Colleagues,

Good evening. We are meeting at a crucial moment in the world’s battle with COVID-19. Such timing has given Minister Lavrov’s initiative to hold a BRICS Foreign Minister’s Meeting special significance. I wish to thank the Russian side for the tremendous work it has done to put this meeting together.

With its rapid spread in many parts of the world, COVID-19 has put lives and health of people around the world under grave threat, seriously disrupted the flow of people worldwide and the global economy, and posed a severe challenge to us BRICS countries.

First of all, on behalf of the Chinese side, I wish to pay high tribute to the healthcare workers fighting at the front lines and express deep condolences over the lives lost to the virus. My heartfelt sympathies go to all the patients and their families.

We are confident that under the firm stewardship of BRICS leaders, with the united, painstaking efforts of our peoples, and the strong support of the global community, we will overcome the difficulties, and mankind will defeat the virus.

The COVID-19 situation begs questions we all need to ponder. Should we let science and reason prevail or create political divisions, bolster cooperation across borders or isolate ourselves through decoupling, promote multilateral coordination or practice unilateralism? We all need to answer these questions in a way that stands the test of history.

As representatives of major emerging countries with global influence, we BRICS countries must act in the interest of the well-being of humankind, and stand by justice and equity. We must make the right call and do the right thing. This is us living up to our due responsibilities. It is also what our peoples and the global community expect from us. To this end, I wish to propose the following.

First, we should uphold multilateralism and improve global governance. The sudden onslaught of COVID-19 reminds us once again that our interests are closely entwined and so are our futures.

A challenge that respects no border and makes no distinction of ethnicity has only made global governance more important, not less. As we live in the same global village on planet Earth, building a community with a shared future for mankind is a right choice that meets the trend of our times.

People wonder what the world would be like after COVID-19? Some have argued that the world will never be the same again.

China’s strategic assessment is that COVID-19 will not change the theme of the times which remains peace and development; it will not cut short the historical trend toward multi-polarity and globalization, and still less will it deter humankind from its firm pursuit of civilization and progress.

In a time of crisis, we must bear in mind both immediate needs and longer-term objectives and promote both our own interests and global well-being. We must work together to sustain a peaceful and stable international environment and foster brighter prospects for win-win progress.

We must stand firm by multilateralism, by the UN-centered international system, and by the purposes and principles of the UN Charter. We need to champion the approach of consultation and cooperation for shared benefits in governance, take the lead in advancing global governance reform along the right direction. Through joint efforts, we will safeguard the legitimate rights and interests and space for development not just for ourselves but also for all other emerging market and developing countries.

We need to enhance coordination on macro economic policies, and take well-focused fiscal and monetary measures on both sides of supply and demand in an effort to curb recession, create jobs, protect livelihoods and stabilize the global economy.

We need to sustain coordination in the UN, the G20 and other multilateral frameworks to keep up secure and smooth functioning of global industrial and supply chains, and defend the multilateral trading regime with the WTO as the cornerstone.

We should continue to work for making development the centerpiece of the global macro policy agenda, and expedite the delivery of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.

Second, we should come together in the spirit of partnership to jointly combat COVID-19. Under the personal leadership and direction of President Xi Jinping, the Chinese government and people have fought a people’s war against COVID-19. We have acted according to the principle of shoring up confidence, strengthening unity, ensuring science-based control and taking targeted measures.

We have all along been open and transparent, and put people’s health and safety front and center.

We reported the infected cases and shared the genetic sequencing of the virus at the earliest possible time. Under the requirement of early detection, reporting, quarantine and treatment, we concentrated the best human and material resources on treating patients with severe conditions.

With extraordinary efforts and sacrifices, we stemmed the spread of the virus at home, and curbed its spread to other parts of the world, providing useful experience for global response and boosting confidence in defeating the virus.

A friend in need is a friend indeed. At the toughest moment in our fight against the disease, fellow BRICS countries and the rest of the global community extended valuable support to us. We will never forget such acts of friendship.

As the virus hits more countries around the world, China is doing everything it can to help those in need. We take BRICS countries as our important partners. In spite of substantial demand at home and growing pressures to meet foreign orders, China has provided a large amount of medical supplies to fellow BRICS countries, and facilitated the purchase of such supplies through commercial channels.

We do all these because we highly value our relations with the fellow BRICS countries. As we see it, looking out for each other in trying times is what the BRICS spirit is all about.

Going forward, China is ready to step up the sharing of information and experience with BRICS countries and conduct joint research and development of drugs and vaccines on the basis of respecting each other’s sovereignty and national conditions. Given the close personnel exchanges among us, we should provide equal protection to the foreign nationals, including students, in each other’s countries. I am confident that, by working together in solidarity, we will forge an ironclad shield against the virus.

Third, we should uphold unity and coordination to forge a powerful synergy. President Xi Jinping stated that the virus is a common enemy of humanity and can only be defeated when we all pitch in.

Living in a global village, no one could stay safe when others’ houses catch fire. Likewise, in fighting COVID-19, victory can only be secured when the virus is brought under control in all countries.

The fact that China has been a strong force behind international anti-epidemic cooperation is because our own experience has made us fully empathetic with other peoples suffering from similar difficulties. We understand that only when COVID-19 is uprooted in the global sphere, can the health and safety of the Chinese people be better protected. China’s readiness to help is inspired by humanitarianism; it has no ideological agenda, and is still less driven by selfish geopolitical interests.

As countries battle the disease in light of their own situations, China calls for mutual understanding and respect for these efforts, and sharing and learning from each other’s experience.

Fighting COVID-19 is like putting out fire. Every minute counts when life is at stake. The global community should never be distracted in its collaborative response by finger-pointing or the blame game, still less should we allow new tensions and divisions to be created as a result of politicization or stigmatization.

China welcomes the appeal by UN Secretary-General Guterres for a global ceasefire. We call on all parties in conflict to lay down their weapons and form the biggest possible synergy in a worldwide, united response to COVID-19.

We the BRICS countries must support UN bodies in playing their due roles in fighting COVID-19. The World Health Organization (WHO) is a central force in coordinating the global response, and is indispensable for helping developing countries, especially our African brothers and sisters, in fighting the disease.

Supporting the WHO helps us save more lives, treat more patients; it enables a more effective response against the virus and is conducive to pooling global strength.

At a crucial moment in humanity’s joint fight against the virus, any attempt to undercut the WHO’s authority and obstruct its role will be most ill-timed and will find no support in the international community.

On top of paying its assessed contributions to the WHO on time and in full, China donated US$20 million to the WHO, and this was followed by another donation of US$30 million announced just a few days ago. Hopefully most of these funds will be used for addressing the urgent needs of developing countries. We will also provide financial support to the UN’s Global Humanitarian Response Plan, and do everything within our capacity to lessen the debt burden on African countries and assist them in boosting anti-epidemic capacity.

In view of the weaknesses and inadequacies exposed during this crisis, we also need to enhance global public health governance, make it a higher priority on the international agenda, and work together to build a community of health for all.

Fourth, we should keep forging ahead with BRICS cooperation. COVID-19 may impact our cooperation in various areas, yet such cooperation should not come to a halt. We must rise to the challenge and turn crisis into opportunity.

China will work with all BRICS members to actively support Russia’s Chairmanship. China also supports Russia’s initiative to formulate a Strategy for BRICS Economic Partnership 2025.

We must pay high attention to the booming new forms of business, like teleworking and online shopping, and devise new models of cooperation and discover new potential of cooperation as we develop the BRICS Partnership on New Industrial Revolution (PartNIR).

We need to make full use of the New Development Bank (NDB) and the Contingent Reserve Arrangement to provide sturdy financial support to our economies. The NDB has made good progress in its membership enlargement. We should work toward identifying the first group of new members before the St Petersburg Summit.

We must also continue to enhance people-to-people exchanges to build solid bridges of friendship among our peoples.

Colleagues,

Let us work together to make BRICS shine brighter in our joint battle against COVID-19 and embrace a better future in our pursuit of common development.

Thank you.",State Councilor and Foreign Minister of the People's Republic of China,Xi Jinping,https://www.fmprc.gov.cn/mfa_eng/wjdt_665385/zyjh_665391/t1774323.shtml,,INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS
Russia,06-09-2006 00:00,Vladimir Putin,Opening Remarks at Meeting with Heads of the Russian Nuclear Weapons and Nuclear Energy Complexes,"Good afternoon, dear colleagues,

Today we are examining priority development issues in the nuclear sector. Military and civilian specialists are taking part in today’s meeting because the problems you have before you are in many ways interconnected. The need to take an all-encompassing approach is reflected too in the state programme ‘On Measures to Develop the Nuclear Sector’ drawn up by the Government.

Our country’s nuclear potential is of vital importance for our national security interests. The reliability of our ‘nuclear shield’ and the state of our nuclear weapons complex are a crucial component of Russia’s world power status. I do stress that our work to develop our nuclear arsenal must go hand in hand with the most stringent demands on reliability and security of operation and, of course, with strict compliance with all non-proliferation regimes. In this respect Russia’s position is firm and unchanging.

The security of our nuclear complex is also clearly an issue of concern to everyone. We must raise the level of protection, and not only from technological risks and emergency situations but also from terrorist provocation.

We must pay particular attention to these demands within the long-term programmes in this sector.

We must not forget that nuclear energy is an important resource for national economic growth. Today when our economy is on the rise, energy supplies have become one of the most important issues.

As you know, the growing appetite for energy is being satisfied principally through gas, and gas consumption is rising all the time in our country. But in the long-term, we cannot resolve the energy supply problem exclusively through fossil fuels, which are non-renewable.

Although we have traditionally been one of the leaders in the nuclear energy sector, we are making totally insufficient use of our potential today. During the Soviet years, up to three gigawatts of electricity generation capacity was brought on line every year, while we have brought on line just one gigawatt of capacity over the last five years.

As a result, the share of nuclear energy in our overall energy production comes to only 16 percent. If we do not take action and continue to proceed at today’s pace, then by 2030 nuclear energy will account for a share of just 1–2 percent in overall energy output.

Many of you here know how the situation stands today in the world regarding nuclear energy. In Germany, for example, which has decided to phase out its nuclear power plants, nuclear energy currently accounts for 32 percent of energy output. We have not taken any such decisions but the sector is nonetheless in decline and today comes to only 16 percent.

In this connection, and given the general rise in energy consumption, we set the goal at the beginning of this year to maintain the current share of nuclear energy in our overall electricity production and to implement a programme in the future to increase this share to 25 percent.

I know that the federal targeted programme for developing the nuclear energy industry sets the objective of bringing on line two gigawatts of capacity a year, but this is enough only to maintain the current level.

I am convinced that our nuclear energy industry can develop at a faster pace. This in turn will boost growth in a whole range of high-technology sectors of the economy and will spur the development of many related scientific disciplines and areas.

I would like to say a few words about the most principled points.

Firstly, it is no secret that the new generation of reactors being used today are in large part based on our developments and achievements. Furthermore, active work is underway on so-called low power reactors. Russia has a considerable lead in this area. It is enough to recall the service life periods of our nuclear power icebreaker fleet and our nuclear submarines.

I remind you also that this year’s Address to the Federal Assembly set the goal of developing promising new directions in energy such as hydrogen and thermonuclear energy. I would like to hear your proposals in this area today.

Secondly, we are convinced that all countries should have the possibility of developing peaceful nuclear programmes. Using nuclear energy will go a long way towards helping many developing countries overcome their energy poverty thereby creating the conditions for socio-economic progress and for raising the quality of life for millions of people on our planet. This will reduce the gaps in economic development between countries and will help to improve the situation overall on the world stage.

As you know, Russia has initiated the creation of international nuclear centres that would give all new consumer countries access to nuclear energy. This would take place, of course, with technical security guarantees and under reliable control by the IAEA.

Thirdly, we must be more active in promoting Russian nuclear technology on the external market. I note that Russia is ready to take part in open competition with other countries in this area. Unfortunately, our companies often encounter unjustified discriminatory barriers.

I repeat that Russia’s position in this area is absolutely logical: we do not need any preferential treatment or special conditions on world markets for our products, above all because we know that our products are perfectly competitive. But we categorically oppose that our companies should be held back in their work by the absence of a level playing field for all participants in the market, all the more so as we are expected to offer a level playing field on our markets. Let others also offer us these same conditions.

Finally, our work on the external market should take into account today’s specific situation. I already said in my federal address that we need to strengthen our position in the nuclear industry machine-tool sector, and we need to do so through the use of the latest technology.

Restructuring in the sector should be carried out with these aims in mind. We must be ready to offer the broadest range of services and products. This means that on the domestic front we need to work actively on developing all aspects of the nuclear fuel cycle, the energy industry machine-tool sector, construction of nuclear power plants, the organisation of research and development work and training qualified specialists for the industry.

Finally, we need to put in place a management mechanism that meets today’s demands and objectives.

The Government has been instructed to draft a programme of support measures for the nuclear weapons and nuclear energy complexes. This work is near completion. Now it is important to ensure the effective realisation of these measures.

I first ask [Deputy Prime Minister and Defence Minister] Sergei Borisovich Ivanov and the [Director of Rosatom] Sergei Vladilenovich Kiriyenko to say a few words and after that we will continue behind closed doors.

China,01-12-2020 00:00,Li Keqiang,"Speech by H.E. Li Keqiang
Premier of the State Council of
The People's Republic of China
At the 19th Meeting of the Council of Heads of Government of
Member States of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization","Colleagues,

I am pleased to join you online for the 19th Meeting of the Council of Heads of Government of Member States of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO). I wish to thank our host for the preparations it has made for this meeting.

Since the onset of COVID-19, SCO members, committed to the Shanghai Spirit, have joined hands to fight against the virus and upheld regional development and stability. President Xi Jinping attended, not long ago, the SCO Heads of State Meeting. We hope that all parties will work together to earnestly deliver the outcomes of the Meeting, steadily advance the SCO's cooperation agenda and vigorously open up new vistas for its development in the post-COVID era.

The world economy is now confronted with the most severe recession since the end of World War II, with drastic contractions of international trade and investment and disruptions in the industrial and supply chains. In the meantime, the growing backlash against economic globalization and mounting protectionism and unilateralism have dealt a blow to the global governance system and multilateral institutions, posing daunting challenges to economic and social development of the region and beyond.

With a crisis comes both challenges and opportunities. Over the past 19 years since its inception, the SCO has risen to challenges, worked to turn crises into opportunities and maintained a sound and steady momentum of growth no matter how the world around us changes. With strong confidence and concerted efforts, we will be able to overcome the impacts of COVID-19, deepen cooperation in wide-ranging fields and achieve greater progress in SCO development. To this end, I wish to propose the following:

First, we need to actively foster a secure and stable environment for development. With uncertainties and destabilizing factors growing in the region, we need to work together to uphold regional peace and stability.

Joint counter-terrorism exercises must continue to be held in order to forestall sabotages by terrorist, separatist and extremist forces exploiting the pandemic. Institution building must be strengthened, and cooperation on deradicalization carried out to effectively address new threats and challenges such as cyber-terrorism and biosafety, and expand the breadth and depth of SCO cooperation on law enforcement and security. We need to guard against data security risks by implementing the Global Initiative on Data Security and work together to enhance data security governance capabilities. We will also cooperate with Afghanistan by making full use of the SCO-Afghanistan Contact Group to support Afghanistan's national reconciliation process and help it restore stability and development at an early date.

Second, we need to earnestly cement the foundation for integrated development. Promoting integrated and interconnected development in keeping with the general trend of the world economy is a sure path to economic recovery of regional countries. Following the direction set by the renewed Program of Multilateral Trade and Economic Cooperation, we need to leverage our complementarity and further substantiate areas of cooperation so as to set the economy on a recovery course.

Two weeks ago, China and other 14 countries signed the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) agreement to establish the world's most promising free trade area with the largest population and the most diverse membership. The RCEP will not only add new impetus to regional development and prosperity, but also serve as an important engine driving global growth. Within the framework of the SCO, we also need to improve liberalization and facilitation of regional trade and investment, and set about putting together institutional arrangements for SCO regional economic cooperation. We will further synergize Belt and Road cooperation with other member states' development strategies and regional cooperation initiatives. The Agreement on International Road Transportation Facilitation must be earnestly implemented, and the formulation of an SCO program for road development accelerated, to promote high-quality connectivity in the region.

While meeting pandemic control requirements, we need to build a regional network of ""fast tracks"" and ""green lanes"" to facilitate the flow of people and goods and contribute to economic reopening in our countries. We need to continue to explore viable approaches to the setting-up of an SCO development bank to energize financial cooperation under the SCO. Cooperation models for modern agriculture will be explored, and farm produce trade expanded to ensure food security in regional countries. China hopes to step up cooperation with other parties in trade in services and share the benefits of its growth. China will publish an index of its trade with other SCO members. We will accelerate the development of the China-SCO Local Economic and Trade Cooperation Demonstration Zone and the SCO demonstration base for exchanges and training on agricultural technologies. All these joint efforts will enable SCO practical cooperation to grow in greater depth.

Third, we need to vigorously leverage the catalytic role of scientific and technological innovation. The new round of technological revolution and industrial transformation is gathering momentum, promising broad prospects for the world economy. In this process, innovation is vital if we are to stay ahead of the development curve and lend strong impetus to the economic revitalization in our countries.

We need to improve the SCO cooperation mechanisms on innovation and explore growth areas such as smart city, artificial intelligence and big data. The boom in Internet economy hastened by COVID response should be well harnessed to promote the integrated development of the digital economy and the real economy and foster new industries and new business forms.

We need to earnestly implement our cooperation document on intellectual property, protect and incentivize innovation and fully bring out the innovation potential. Concrete efforts are needed to remove barriers against the flow of innovation factors and foster an open, cooperative and non-discriminatory business environment for companies of all countries.

China is making preparations for an SCO technological transfer center and will host the second SCO Member States Youth Innovation and Entrepreneurship Competition. We will work with other parties to ensure the success of the SCO Environment Information Sharing Platform and jointly promote high-quality economic development and green recovery.

Fourth, we need to actively pursue people-centered cooperation. Sustaining and improving people's well-being is a priority for regional countries. Tackling the acute deficiencies and weaknesses in livelihood areas, we need to proactively carry out cooperation in such fields as medical care and health, poverty relief, education and culture so that our people get benefits from the SCO cooperation.

As we speak, COVID-19 is still ravaging the world. It is thus imperative that we expedite cooperation on the research and development of vaccines and drugs. COVID-19 vaccines, when developed and deployed in China, will be made a global public good. This will be China's contribution to ensuring vaccine accessibility and affordability.

This year, China is set to win the battle against extreme poverty. Despite the impact of COVID-19, we will lift out of poverty all the rural residents living below the current poverty line as scheduled, blazing a path of poverty eradication that suits China's national conditions. We stand ready to carry out poverty reduction training with other SCO countries and contribute our share to livelihood improvement in the region. China suggests intensifying efforts in developing the SCO University, bringing more universities and disciplines into this network and cultivating more future-oriented professionals. China proposes establishing an SCO international museum alliance and signing a memorandum on the mutual translation of literary classics, with a view to promoting mutual learning among civilizations and bringing our peoples closer.

Colleagues,

Peace and development remain the theme of our times. Openness and cooperation still represent the overwhelming trend. We need to uphold multilateralism and free trade and facilitate the improvement of the global economic governance system. We need to stay committed to fostering an open world economy and safeguard the smooth operation of global industrial and supply chains. Following a global governance philosophy emphasizing extensive consultation, joint contribution and shared benefits, we need to take an active part in WTO reform, promote equality of rights, opportunities and rules for all countries, and defend the legitimate rights and interests of emerging markets and developing countries. China supports the SCO in deepening cooperation with the United Nations and other multilateral frameworks and making joint efforts to safeguard the authority and effectiveness of the multilateral system and build a new type of international relations and a community with a shared future for mankind.

China is committed to a win-win strategy of opening-up and to sharing opportunities with the rest of the world as it pursues development. Let us work together with a common purpose and forge ahead to create an even brighter future for the SCO.

Thank you.",Premier,Xi Jinping,https://www.fmprc.gov.cn/mfa_eng/wjdt_665385/zyjh_665391/t1837843.shtml,,INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS
USA,17-11-2015,Barack Obama,Remarks by President Obama After Touring the BRP Gregorio del Pilar,"Good afternoon, everybody.  It is wonderful to be back in the Philippines.  And I want to thank Secretary Gazmin, General Iriberri, Rear Admiral Alano and Melad, Captain Sibala, and the members of the Philippine Armed Forces for welcoming me here today.  I want to acknowledge the American servicemembers who are here and who are part of our unbreakable alliance.

The United States has been committed to the security of this region for more than 70 years.  We have a treaty obligation, an ironclad commitment to the defense of our ally, the Philippines.  You can count on the United States.

My visit here underscores our shared commitment to the security of the waters of this region and to the freedom of navigation.  This watch center was built with U.S. grants.  The ship that I just toured, a former U.S. Coast Guard vessel, helps the Philippines respond to disasters, perform counterterrorism missions, and patrol the South China Sea.

Today, I can announce that we intend to transfer two additional ships to the Philippine Navy, a research vessel to help map its territorial waters, and another U.S. Coast Guard cutter to bolster the Navy’s ability to conduct long-endurance patrols.  It’s part of our larger plan to increase maritime security assistance to our allies and our partners across the region -- $250 million over the course of two years.  More capable navies and partnership with the United States are critical to the security of this region.

And I want to thank once again the members of the Philippine Armed Forces for their outstanding work.  And, Mr. Secretary, I can tell you that after inspection, the ship looks like it’s in tip-top shape.  Thank you so much.

Russia,04-12-2004 00:00,Vladimir Putin,Opening Address at a Ceremony Celebrating Cosmonautics Day,"Good day, dear friends,

Today we celebrate Cosmonautics Day. 43 years ago, a great event took place in the history of civilization – the first person flew into space.

People had dreamed of travelling closer to the stars for a long time. They wanted to understand and discover the secret of the Universe. And on 12 April 1961, this age essentially began.

This day is remembered by all countries, all continents. It is still a general celebration, because all of mankind rejoiced in this event together. Undoubtedly, it was a planet-wide triumph and a planet-wide rejoicing. And we, of course, were proud, and are still quite rightfully proud, that this celebration, this breakthrough for mankind was made by our country.

We will always be proud that the first person in space was a citizen of our country – Yury Alexeevich Gagarin. Everyone who helped to prepare this flight, without exaggeration, started the space age, as I already said.

Not much time has passed since then, but just think what heights mankind has reached since space exploration began. And most importantly, without this activity, we could not imagine our lives and the development of high technology branches of manufacture.

Today, space remains the horizon which, as we move towards it, brings scientific discoveries, progress, and previously unexplored possibilities.

Today there is no longer any need to argue about the enormous benefit of cosmonautics. It is also pleasing for me to note recent studies of public opinion in Russia: over 80% of citizens think that it is absolutely necessary. It is necessary for the country. I would like to note that several years ago far from everyone believed this. At any rate, in surveys and sociological research, there has never been a result like this.

Today there is no need to argue about the importance of this activity. Life itself has proved that not a single global problem, whether it is ecology or ensuring thorough international security, can be solved without the widest use of space resources.

In many ways, thanks to cosmonautics we joined the society of highly developed countries and gained a firm footing in it. It is this sphere of activity that allowed our country to take a leading position in a range of high technology areas. Furthermore, since the very beginning of the space age we have been aware of our special historic mission. And we have not just explored space in a purely technological way – over many years, we have had a spiritual attachment to space. It has been the object of our national pride.

And, as I address all employees of the space rocket industry today, I would like to thank you for everything that you have done over the past decades, and for preserving the enormous space potential of the country in very difficult conditions of our country’s development. You have preserved the international prestige of Russian cosmonautics. And, importantly, you have been able to maintain the enormous importance of space exploration for the fate of the country.

Today, the very essence of space activity is changing. We all know that for many years, space was an area for military and political rivalry. Today, we are doing, and must do, everything to demilitarize space. And by turning it into an arena of international cooperation, cooperation founded on trust, careful calculation and clear understanding of all national interests, we must do everything to ensure that space exploration is of an exclusively peaceful nature.

Thorough expansion and intensification of work in space is our strategic priority. It is clear that only in these conditions can Russia aspire to a leading international position.

Our country still has a unique space potential, especially in the area of lengthy space flights. And our cooperation in the programme of the International space station is proof that this fact cannot be denied.

As you know, the International space station today works thanks to manned and cargo ships, which provide the station which everything it needs.

Space activity is required today in the most varied spheres, and makes it possible to solve serious tasks in the areas of communication, geology, agriculture, and protection of the environment.

In conclusion, I would like to congratulate you all on this celebration, and wish you creative success and triumphs. I wish you new personal achievements. And, of course, I wish all your families health and prosperity.

Thank you very much. Happy Cosmonautics Day!

Weekly Address: America is Leading the World"," Hi, everybody. American leadership is the one constant in an uncertain world. That was true this week, as we mobilized the world to confront some of our most urgent challenges.

America is leading the world in the fight to degrade and ultimately destroy the terrorist group known as ISIL. On Monday, our brave men and women in uniform began air strikes against ISIL targets in Syria. And they weren’t alone. I made it clear that America would act as part of a broad coalition, and we were joined in this action by friends and partners, including Arab nations. At the United Nations in New York, I worked to build more support for this coalition; to cut off terrorist financing; and to stop the flow of foreign fighters into and out of that region. And in my address to the UN, I challenged the world -- especially Muslim communities – to reject the ideology of violent extremism, and to do more to tap the extraordinary potential of their young people.

America is leading the effort to rally the world against Russian aggression in Ukraine. Along with our allies, we will support the people of Ukraine as they develop their democracy and economy. And this week, I called upon even more nations to join us on the right side of history.

America is leading the fight to contain and combat the Ebola epidemic in West Africa. We’re deploying our doctors and scientists -- supported by our military -- to help corral the outbreak and pursue new treatments. From the United Kingdom and Germany to France and Senegal, other nations are stepping up their efforts, too, sending money, supplies, and personnel. And we will continue to rally other countries to join us in making concrete commitments to fight this disease, and enhance global health security for the long-term.

America is engaging more partners and allies than ever to confront the growing threat of climate change before it’s too late. We’re doing our part, and helping developing nations do theirs. At home, we’ve invested in clean energy, cut carbon pollution, and created new jobs in the process. Abroad, our climate assistance now reaches more than 120 nations. And on Tuesday, I called on every nation – developed and developing alike -- to join us in this effort for the sake of future generations.

The people of the world look to us to lead. And we welcome that responsibility. We are heirs to a proud legacy of freedom. And as we showed the world this week, we are prepared to do what is necessary to secure that legacy for generations to come.

Thanks, and have a great weekend.",President,Barack Obama,https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/the-press-office/2014/09/27/weekly-address-america-leading-world,,INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS
USA,29-08-2015,Barack Obama,"
Weekly Address: Meeting the Global Threat of Climate Change"," Hi, everybody.  This Monday, I’m heading to Alaska for a three-day tour of the state. 

I’ve been looking forward to this for a long time.  Not only because Alaska is one of the most beautiful places in a country that’s full of beautiful places – but because I’ll have several opportunities to meet with everyday Alaskans about what’s going on in their lives.  I’ll travel throughout the state, meeting with Alaskans who live above the Arctic Circle, with Alaska natives, and with folks who earn their livelihoods through fishing and tourism.  And I expect to learn a lot.

One thing I’ve learned so far is that a lot of these conversations begin with climate change.  And that’s because Alaskans are already living with its effects.  More frequent and extensive wildfires.  Bigger storm surges as sea ice melts faster.  Some of the swiftest shoreline erosion in the world – in some places, more than three feet a year. 

Alaska’s glaciers are melting faster too, threatening tourism and adding to rising seas.  And if we do nothing, Alaskan temperatures are projected to rise between six and twelve degrees by the end of the century, changing all sorts of industries forever. 

This is all real.  This is happening to our fellow Americans right now.  In fact, Alaska’s governor recently told me that four villages are in “imminent danger” and have to be relocated.  Already, rising sea levels are beginning to swallow one island community. 

Think about that.  If another country threatened to wipe out an American town, we’d do everything in our power to protect ourselves.  Climate change poses the same threat, right now. 

That’s why one of the things I’ll do while I’m in Alaska is to convene other nations to meet this threat.  Several Arctic nations have already committed to action.  Since the United States and China worked together to set ambitious climate targets last year, leading by example, many of the world’s biggest emitters have come forward with new climate plans of their own.  And that’s a good sign as we approach this December’s global climate negotiations in Paris.

Now, one of the ways America is leading is by transitioning away from dirty energy sources that threaten our health and our environment, and by going all-in on clean, renewable energy sources like wind and solar.  And Alaska has the natural resources to be a global leader in this effort. 

Now even as we accelerate this transition, our economy still has to rely on oil and gas.  As long as that’s the case, I believe we should rely more on domestic production than on foreign imports, and we should demand the highest safety standards in the industry – our own.  Still, I know there are Americans who are concerned about oil companies drilling in environmentally sensitive waters.  Some are also concerned with my administration’s decision to approve Shell’s application to drill a well off the Alaskan coast, using leases they purchased before I took office.  I share people’s concerns about offshore drilling.  I remember the BP spill in the Gulf of Mexico all too well. 

That’s precisely why my administration has worked to make sure that our oil exploration conducted under these leases is done at the highest standards possible, with requirements specifically tailored to the risks of drilling off Alaska.  We don’t rubber-stamp permits.  We made it clear that Shell has to meet our high standards in how they conduct their operations – and it's a testament to how rigorous we've applied those standards that Shell has delayed and limited its exploration off Alaska while trying to meet them.  The bottom line is, safety has been and will continue to be my administration’s top priority when it comes to oil and gas exploration off America’s precious coasts – even as we push our economy and the world to ultimately transition off of fossil fuels.

So I’m looking forward to talking with Alaskans about how we can work together to make America the global leader on climate change around the globe.  And we’re going to offer unique and engaging ways for you to join me on this trip all week at WhiteHouse.gov/Alaska.  Because what’s happening in Alaska is happening to us.  It’s our wakeup call.  And as long as I’m President, America will lead the world to meet the threat of climate change before it’s too late.

Thanks, and have a great weekend.",President,Barack Obama,https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/the-press-office/2015/08/29/weekly-address-meeting-global-threat-climate-change,,DEVELOPMENT
USA,04-09-2020 00:00,Donald Trump,"Remarks by President Trump After Air Force One Arrival | Joint Base Andrews, MD | September 3, 2020","THE PRESIDENT: Well, thank you very much. We had a very successful day. Pennsylvania was — that was incredible. The crowd was incredible. You saw what was unable to get in. We had thousands of people unable to get in. And I appreciate everybody being there. That was really a terrific moment, I think, coming off the plane. And it doesn’t get any bigger than that.

I did hear, though, when reentering the plane, I was told by Mark and Hope and some others that some horrible things were said. Fake things. Fake news. Corrupt news. The kind of news that’s ruining your profession. And everyone knows it’s totally false.

General Keith Kellogg, who’s a highly respected man, couldn’t believe when he heard it. And he knows everything about — all of it.

And to think that I would make statements negative to our military and our fallen heroes, when nobody has done what I’ve done, with the budgets, with the military budgets, with getting pay raises for our military.

It is a disgraceful situation by a magazine that’s a terrible magazine. I don’t read it, but I just heard about it. They made it up. And, probably, it’s a couple of people that have been failures in the administration that I got rid of. And I couldn’t get rid of them fast enough. But — or it was just made up. But it’s unthinkable.

As far as John McCain is concerned, I was never a fan. And I will admit that openly. I disagreed with him on the endless wars. I disagreed with him with respect to the vets and the taking care of the VA. I wanted to do it a much different way. And I think it’s proven to be a much more successful way when you look at the success we’ve had with the VA and with our vets, with Choice and with Accountability, all the things I’ve gotten. So I disagreed with John McCain, but I still respected him.

And I had to approve his funeral as President. We lowered the flags. I had to approve that, nobody else. I had to approve it. When you think — as I’m just thinking back, I had to approve either Air Force One or a military plane to go to Arizona to pick up his casket. And I approved it immediately. I had to approve the funeral, because he had a first-class, triple-A funeral that lasted for nine days, by the way. I had to approve it. All of that had to be approved by the President. I approved it without hesitation and without complaint. And I felt he deserved it. I disagreed with him on things, and he was a tough guy, but I felt he deserved it.

For somebody to say the things that they say I said is a total lie. It’s fake news. It’s a disgrace. And frankly, it’s a disgrace to your profession.

Now, with all of that being said, you’ll speak to Keith Kellogg, you’ll speak to other people, because many people knew.

Let me just go into the — if I might, into the trip to Europe and to France. I was ready to go to a ceremony; I had two of them. One the following day; it was pouring, and I went to that. But the helicopter could not fly. The reason it couldn’t fly is because it was raining about as hard as I’ve ever seen. And, on top of that, it was very, very foggy. And the helicopter was unable to fly. It was a fairly long helicopter flight, but it was a very long drive.

In order for me to go, we would have had to leave immediately and go through very busy areas of, I guess, Paris — but a very, very heavily traveled area, a very — a big city. I think it was Paris. And the Secret Service told me, “You can’t do it.” I said, “I have to do it. I want to be there.” They said, “You can’t do it.” We’ll get you confirmation on this. They said, “For you to do that” — make that trip not by helicopter flying over everything — “we have to work with the police. We have to work with everything.”

And I think you’ll find on record, in the police force, in the areas that we’re talking about — areas of Paris that we’re talking about — I think you’ll find on-record requests. And we actually have Secret Service that I’m going to ask to give you details. They said, “You can’t do it.” It was two and a half hours or two hours of driving. It was a long drive. They said, “You can’t do it.”

So I said, “No, I want to do it.” They said, “You can’t.” There was no way I would have been able to do it. And they would never have been able to get the police and everybody else in line to have a President go through a very crowded, very congested area.

So I went and I called home. I spoke to my wife. I said, “I hate this. I came here to go to that ceremony,” and to the one that was the following day, which I did go to. I said, “I feel terribly.” And that was the end of it.

Now, all of a sudden, somebody makes up this horrible story that I didn’t want to go. And then they make up an even worse story — an even worse story, calling certain names to our fallen heroes. It’s a disgrace that a magazine is able to write it.

And anybody that — if the — if they really exist, if people really exist that would have said that, they’re low-lives and they’re liars. And I would be willing to swear on anything that I never said that about our fallen heroes. There is nobody that respects them more. So I just think it’s a horrible, horrible thing.

We made a great evening into, frankly, a very sad evening, when I see a statement like that. No animal, nobody — what animal would say such a thing? And especially since I’ve done more, I think, than almost anybody to help our military, to get the budgets of our military, to get the pay raises for our military. So I just think it’s a horrible thing that they’re allowed to write that.

And we can refute it. We have other people that will refute it. And the one I would like you to speak to is General Keith Kellogg, because he knows exactly the story. But you can also speak to Secret Service. They wouldn’t let me go no matter what happened, because of security, because of safety.

So I want to thank you for being here. There’s nothing much more that I can say. All they’re trying to do is influence a presidential election, where we’ve gone very high in the polls in the last short period of time, where we’re doing very well, where we’re going to win and they’re going crazy.

The magazine in question is a never-Trumper magazine, probably doing badly. I know nothing about it. I don’t read it; I just heard about it now — about this story. But it’s a total never-Trumper magazine and other people that are trying to influence the outcome of a presidential election. And you know what? People are too smart for it. And somebody has to make a stand. This fake press is a disgrace.

Thank you very much, everybody. Thank you.",President,Donald Trump,https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefings-statements/remarks-president-trump-air-force-one-arrival-joint-base-andrews-md-september-3-2020/,,OTHERS
China,25-09-2015 00:00,Xi Jinping,Remarks by H.E. Xi Jinping President of the People's Republic of China At Arrival Ceremony On the South Lawn of the White House,"Mr. President and Mrs. Obama,
Ladies and Gentlemen,
Dear Friends,

In this golden season of autumn, my wife and I are very pleased to come to the beautiful city of Washington D.C. At the outset, I wish to thank you, Mr. President, for your kind invitation and gracious hospitality. I also wish to convey to the American people the warm regards and best wishes of over 1.3 billion Chinese people.

China and the United States are both great nations. The Chinese and American people are two great peoples. Since we established diplomatic relations 36 years ago, China-US relations have forged ahead despite twists and turns and made historic advances.

At our Sunnylands meeting in the summer of 2013, President Obama and I made the strategic decision of building a new model of major-country relations. More than two years have passed, and we have made important progress in various areas of exchange and cooperation. This has been welcomed by people of our two countries and the world at large.

Working together, China and the United States can make a greater impact than our individual efforts. To grow our relationship under the new conditions, we must adapt to the changing times and seize the positive momentum. I come to the United States this time to promote peace and advance cooperation. We would like to work with the US side to make greater advances in our relationship and deliver more benefits to people of our two countries and the whole world.

- We must uphold the right direction of building a new model of major-country relations, make sure our relationship is defined by peace, respect and cooperation, and see to it that it keeps moving forward on the sound track of steady growth.

- We must enhance strategic trust and mutual understanding, respect each other's interests and concerns, be broad-minded about our differences and disagreements, and strengthen our people's confidence in China-US friendship and cooperation.

- We must pursue win-win cooperation, update the model and broaden the scope of our collaboration, and improve the well-being of people of our two countries and the world through concrete actions and outcomes of cooperation.

- We must enhance friendship and promote interactions between our people, encourage our two societies to meet each other half way, and cement the social foundation of China-US relations.

- We must promote world peace and development, improve coordination on major international and regional issues, make concerted efforts to address global challenges, and work with other nations to build a better world.

Thirty years ago, during my first visit to the United States, I was hosted by an American family in Muscatine, Iowa. My hosts were so warm, sincere and friendly. We had cordial conversations. And we hugged tightly when we had to say goodbye. To this day, those moments are still fresh in my memory. Three years ago, I went back to Muscatine and had a reunion with my old friends there. They said to me, friendship is a big business. From these old friends and from many other American friends, I can feel first-hand the genuine friendship between the Chinese and American people. We do share each other's feelings. This gives me every confidence about the future of our relations.

Ladies and Gentlemen,

Dear Friends,

Success comes with dedicated efforts. China-US relations have reached a new starting point in the 21st century. For further growth of our relations, we have no choice but to seek win-win cooperation. Let us work hand in hand with great resolve to write a new chapter in China-US relations!

USA,26-10-2013,Barack Obama,"
Weekly Address: Enrolling in the Affordable Care Act Marketplace"," Hi, everybody. A few weeks ago, we launched an important new part of the Affordable Care Act.  

It’s called the Marketplace.  And for Americans without health insurance, and Americans who buy insurance on their own because they can’t get it at work, it’s a very big deal.  

If you’re one of those people, the Affordable Care Act makes you part of a big group plan for the first time.  The Marketplace is where you can apply and shop for affordable new health insurance choices.  It gathers insurers under one system to compete for your business.  And that choice and competition have actually helped bring prices down.

Ultimately, the easiest way to buy insurance in this Marketplace will be a new website, HealthCare.gov.  But as you may have heard, the site isn’t working the way it’s supposed to yet.  That’s frustrating for all of us who have worked so hard to make sure everyone who needs it gets health care.  And it’s especially frustrating for the Americans who’ve been trying to get covered.  The site has been visited more than 20 million times so far.  Nearly 700,000 people have applied for coverage already.  That proves just how much demand there is for these new quality, affordable health care choices.  And that’s why, in the coming weeks, we are going to get it working as smoothly as it’s supposed to.  We’ve got people working overtime, 24/7, to boost capacity and address these problems, every single day.

But even as we improve the website, remember that the website isn’t the only way to apply for coverage under these new plans.  We’ve updated HealthCare.gov to offer more information about enrolling over the phone, by mail, or in person with a specially-trained navigator who can help answer your questions.  Just call 1-800-318-2596 or visit LocalHelp.HealthCare.gov.  Don’t worry – these plans will not sell out.  We’re only a few weeks into a six-month open enrollment period, and everyone who wants insurance through the Marketplace will get it.

Some people have poked fun at me this week for sounding like an insurance salesman.  And that’s okay.  I’d still be out there championing this law even if the website were perfect.  I’ll never stop fighting to help more hardworking Americans know the economic security of health care.  That’s something we should all want.

That’s why it’s also interesting to see Republicans in Congress expressing so much concern that people are having trouble buying health insurance through the new website – especially considering they’ve spent the last few years so obsessed with denying those same people access to health insurance that they just shut down the government and threatened default over it. 

As I’ve said many times before, I’m willing to work with anyone, on any idea, who’s actually willing to make this law perform better.  But it’s well past the time for folks to stop rooting for its failure.  Because hardworking, middle-class families are rooting for its success.

The Affordable Care Act gives people who’ve been stuck with sky-high premiums because of preexisting conditions the chance to get affordable insurance for the first time.  

This law means that women can finally buy coverage that doesn’t charge them higher premiums than men for the same care.  

And everyone who already has health insurance, whether through your employer, Medicare, or Medicaid, will keep the benefits and protections this law has already put in place.  Three million more young adults have health insurance on their parents’ plans because of the Affordable Care Act.  More than six million people on Medicare have saved an average of $1,000 on their prescription medicine because of the Affordable Care Act.  Last year, more than 8 million Americans received half a billion dollars in refunds from their insurers because of the Affordable Care Act.  And for tens of millions of women, preventive care like mammograms and birth control are free because of the Affordable Care Act.  

That’s all part of this law, and it’s here to stay.

We did not fight so hard for this reform for so many years just to build a website.  We did it to free millions of American families from the awful fear that one illness or injury – to yourself or your child – might cost you everything you’d worked so hard to build.  We did it to cement the principle that in this country, the security of health care is not a privilege for a fortunate few, but a right for every one of us to enjoy.  We have already delivered on part of that promise, and we will not rest until the work is done.

Thank you, and have a great weekend.",President,Barack Obama,https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/the-press-office/2013/10/26/weekly-address-enrolling-affordable-care-act-marketplace,,DEVELOPMENT
Russia,06-10-2018 00:00,Vladimir Putin,Shanghai Cooperation Organisation Summit,"Mr President,

Colleagues,

I share my colleague’s opinion that the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation is successfully progressing. With the accession of India and Pakistan – whose leaders are attending the meeting for the first time as full-fledged members – our organisation has become stronger, expanding its boundaries and capabilities.

I would like to stress that countering terrorism remains the priority for cooperation within the SCO. The programme adopted today on countering terrorism, separatism and extremism identifies cooperation benchmarks in that area for the coming three years.

The programme envisions holding joint drills and counter-terror operations, streamlining a closer exchange of experience and operational information. We expect the SCO Youth Council to actively participate in our work on preventing the recruitment of young people to participate in terrorist activities.

One of the SCO’s priorities is assisting in the political and diplomatic settlement of conflicts near the external borders of the organisation’s member states. The situation in Afghanistan calls for special attention, I agree with my colleagues who spoke about this earlier.

It is crucial that we fight the terrorist threat emanating from that country in unison, curb drug production and trafficking and render aid to Afghanistan in its national reconciliation, economic revival and stabilisation.

There has been good progress in the fight against terrorism in Syria. Thanks to the coordinated actions of Russia, the Syrian Government, Iran, Turkey, and other partners, including Kazakhstan, terrorist activity has become largely suppressed in that country. This opened the way to a political settlement.

Colleagues, I would like to note that the Government of Syria today controls an area that is home to about 90 percent of the country’s population. Damascus is following the agreements reached at the Syrian National Dialogue Congress in Sochi in January, and has sent proposals on constitutional committee members from the Government of the Syrian Republic to prepare the new fundamental law of the country. Therefore, the Syrian Government is fully abiding by its obligations and has shown its commitment to a political dialogue. Now it is up to the opposition.

Undoubtedly, our countries cannot help worrying about the situation around the Iranian nuclear program. The US withdrawal from the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action could destabilise the situation. Russia stands for the consistent, rigorous implementation of the JCPOA. For our part, we will continue to honour all our commitments.

The problem on the Korean Peninsula is having a significant impact on the security situation in the SCO space. We positively assess the desire of Pyongyang, Seoul and Washington to reach a comprehensive resolution of the crisis through dialogue and negotiations in line with the roadmap proposed by Russia and China.

The SCO should continue to help normalise the situation in the region. Russia welcomes the forthcoming summit between the United States and North Korea and acknowledges China’s great contribution to the resolution of the Korean crisis.

Colleagues,

An important track of SCO activity is the development of mutually beneficial economic ties between our countries. Trade and investment are gaining momentum. We are simplifying the mutual availability of goods and services, improving customs regulations, eliminating unnecessary administrative barriers, and implementing joint projects in energy, transport and agriculture.

We are working on several integration initiatives between our countries. In May, a cooperation agreement between the Eurasian Economic Union and China was signed in Astana, Kazakhstan. It is important to take additional steps that would lead to increased coordination in the implementation of trade, investment and infrastructure projects through the EAEU and China’s Belt and Road programme. Russia and China are also preparing an agreement on the Eurasian Economic Partnership, which, of course, will be open to all the SCO countries.

I would like to use this opportunity to invite representatives of your countries to participate in the first meeting of the heads of regions of the SCO member states and in the Forum on Small Business of the SCO and BRICS regions, which are to be held in the Russian Federation.

Colleagues, at the end of the year, the term of office of the Secretary General of the SCO and the Director of the Executive Committee of the RATS expires. I would like to express my gratitude to our colleagues for their efficient work and wish success to their successors.

In conclusion, I would like to thank President Xi Jinping and all our Chinese friends for their very warm welcome and hospitality and congratulate China on its successful presidency of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation.

Today, Kyrgyzstan is taking over. Our Kyrgyz friends can count on all possible assistance from the Russian side.

Thank you.

Hill Harper and Logan Lerman are here, as well, and we’re going to be joined by Daughtry, who’s playing at a big USO Show at Yokota Air Base in Japan. (Applause.)

And we’ve got some of the finest musicians in our military. (Applause.) We’ve got Sergeant Christiana Ball, U.S. Army -- (applause) -- and Captain John Auer and Captain Matt Smith, United States Marine Corps. (Applause.)

So between all of these folks, we’ve got a little bit of rock and roll, we’ve got a little bit of country, little bit of everything in between. And that’s fitting because here in America, no matter where you’re from, no matter what music you listen to, we’re all united in our respect and admiration for our brave men and women who wear our country’s uniform. (Applause.) So let’s give it up to -- let’s give it up for the servicemembers, the veterans, the families. We are so grateful to have you here tonight.

One of my greatest privileges as Commander-in-Chief is the opportunity to spend time with all of you and your families. I’ve met young men who willingly chose to move toward grenades to save their friends. I’ve met heroes who ran into enemy fire and carry their comrades to safety. And I’ve seen their families, and the stress and strains that they go through, but nevertheless, they couldn’t be prouder to support those family members who serve.

We’ve seen, obviously, families of the fallen who keep the spirit of their loved ones alive, and their strength then inspires the rest of us. And of course, we are inspired by our wounded warriors whose injuries are no match for the sheer force of will that they display every single day. And some of them are joining us here from Walter Reed tonight. We are especially proud of them. (Applause.)

Just one story I want to tell, because I’ve gotten to know these folks pretty well. One of the wounded warriors here is Captain Luis Avila. I met Luis and his beautiful wife Claudia a few times, and their wonderful kids, and I want to just take a moment to share their story with you because I think it’s representative of what it means to serve the United States of America, to be a true patriot.

Almost three years ago, just after Christmas, Luis was in his fifth deployment –- this time in Afghanistan -– when he was severely injured in an explosion. He lost his leg, fractured his spine, suffered two heart attacks and a traumatic brain injury. Two weeks after the explosion, he arrived in the United States in a coma and on life support. It was so dire that Claudia was forced to confront that agonizing question –- was it time for her to let him go, take him off life support?

But if you have a chance to meet Claudia, she’s pretty strong and pretty stubborn. And she also had faith that Luis would recover. And as she prayed during those desperate days, she began praying -- some of Luis’s -- famous songs in the background: “Ode to Joy,” military marches, and some Beatles. At then he started twitching his facial muscles. And then he opened his mouth. And then he moved his tongue on command. And the whole time, Claudia was playing music day and night.

And then finally, Luis woke up. He couldn’t see. He couldn’t eat. He couldn’t talk. But he’d heard those songs. And in the months and years that followed, he kept fighting back with the help of hundreds of hours of music therapy. And today, Luis can see again, he can eat again, he can speak again. He’s even playing, as I understand, a little bit of golf. (Laughter.) And every night, he still goes to sleep with music playing.

So tonight we’re honored to be joined by heroes like Luis and loving families like Claudia and their three boys, Luis Jr., Miguel and José. And we honor them with the beauty of music –- music that has the power to inspire us and fill us with pride, and, yes, sometimes to help us heal. And once this concert is over, let’s pledge to carry that spirit back to our own communities and to do our part, as Americans, to always serve these men and women as well as they have served us.

But for now, let’s have a little bit of fun. Please welcome the one and only Mr. Willie Nelson. (Applause.)",President,Barack Obama,https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/the-press-office/2014/11/06/remarks-president-salute-troops-concert-white-house,,DEVELOPMENT
Russia,11-05-2002 00:00,Vladimir Putin,Excerpts from the Introductory Remarks at a Meeting with the Heads of the Regions in the Southern Federal District,"Good afternoon.

We have just been visiting, together with some of those present, some places where reconstruction work is underway. We have again seen that flooding has caused severe damage to several regions in the Southern Federal District of Russia. The Krasnodar Region was hit by three floods in a row. Obviously, the scale of the devastation and damage and the speed at which the situation developed have called for very prompt and decisive actions, both in terms of organisation and financing.

Through common efforts transport communications, gas and water supplies in all communities have been restored within a fairly short time. Initially there are temporary arrangements, but the whole life support system is shortly to be put on a permanent mode of operation.

It is important that medical help and monitoring of the sanitary and epidemiological situation have been promptly organised. This prevented the spread of mass infectious diseases.

The main problem is housing the victims. The federal budget has earmarked 6.5 billion roubles to solve these problems. As of today the building and buying of flats, that is, acquiring them in the secondary market, has provided housing for only 22.8% of the victims, and yet it is already the end of autumn – November. I can’t say that we are keeping up the necessary pace.

The repair of damaged flats has been moving forward faster. About 90% of such housing has been restored. But in some regions the subsidies made available for the repair are still sitting in the accounts of Sberbank. I cannot describe that part of the work as satisfactory.

Let me remind you that we have agreed that by December 1 all the victims will have a roof over their heads. Time is running out. Please, monitor the situation not on the basis of formal reports, but on the basis of the situation on the ground. I must say that the work the Government is conducting in this sphere has such a large scale that it is unlikely that any other country has ever done such work, but I would like to warn all those present: we should not imagine that we are doing acts of charity. We are doing it, first, because many people live below the poverty line and it is our duty to do it. And secondly, our insurance system is not working.

In the rest of the civilised world there are solid insurance guarantees against the contingency of a natural disaster. In this country, whenever emergency situations arise, there is no effective mechanism for reconstruction. The challenge is to create it within the shortest time possible, including through the use of an effective insurance services market.

* * *

And now let us move on to the question of the interaction between the federal and regional authorities in the face of the growing terrorist threat. That threat demands still greater consolidation of efforts at all levels of Government. I must recognise that in the dramatic days of October the heads of the regions did much to ensure the security of citizens and preserve social stability. I would like to thank you for that and I take this opportunity to thank all our colleagues in other regions of the Russian Federation. A lot depended on you, on your restraint, your commitment to facing problems, and a certain impulse emanated from you, an impulse in the right direction.

But under the current conditions fundamentally new approaches are needed, approaches that have to do not only with the work of the law enforcement bodies, but of the whole system of state institutions. Special emphasis must be laid on preventing terrorist attacks.

First of all the very character of modern terrorist threats presents a new challenge in terms of prompt response, teamwork and the ability to be “pro-active”. It is precisely the case when lack of information, insight and knowledge of the situation may lead to dire consequences.

Besides, opposing terrorism is not only the task of the military and security agencies. The civilian authorities too share the responsibility for protecting the population. I would like to remind you that there are anti-terrorist commissions at present in every region of the Federation. I believe that it is up to them to perfect the mechanisms of interaction between the security agencies, the regional and federal bodies of power.

The staffs of the Presidential Envoys should also play a coordinating role. I would like to bring it to the attention of the President’s Envoy Viktor Kazantsev. I have met with all the Envoys. This is an area in which they can and must prove their usefulness. It is one of the reasons why the institution was created in the first place.

Besides, in any extreme situations the medical services, the rescue, psychological assistance and other services must operate efficiently. I think these services need to be strengthened, especially at the level of regional authorities.

The Southern Federal District of course is a very special one. It is not only due to the problems that still persist in the Chechen Republic. Many long-standing problems have yet to be solved in the south of Russia because it is a multi-ethnic region. Some of these have historical roots and some are connected with the current economic development of Russia and its regions.

I am referring to the complicated migration flows, a subject that we have frequently discussed with Alexander Tkachyov. It is a very acute problem for the Stavropol Region and other regions of Russia. The economic infrastructure is undeveloped and there are employment problems. The most pressing problems of course are in the Chechen Republic. And there are many similar problems in Ossetia.

Extremist forces – religious, nationalistic, etc. – try to take advantage of any social and economic tensions. In the absence of law and order and government control some of them begin to interact with terrorist organisations. I would like to draw the attention of the heads of the regions and of the security agencies to the legal powers they have under the Law “On Counteracting Extremist Activities” passed in the summer of 2002. And I would like to remind the heads of the military and security agencies that all their actions in the Russian Federation must fully comply with the law.

In conclusion to my brief speech, I would like to note that maintaining stability in the regions is a two-fold task. It is equally important for us to ensure the safety of citizens and at the same time to secure an upsurge of the economy and the social sphere. So I am urging all the bodies of power to cooperate closely in addressing that task.

Thank you.",President,Vladimir Putin,http://en.kremlin.ru/events/president/transcripts/statements/21766,,DEVELOPMENT
Russia,28-06-2005,Vladimir Putin,Introductory Remarks at the Security Council Session,"Good afternoon, dear colleagues,

Today we are having a regular scheduled session of the Security Council. The item we have on the agenda today, however, is a complex issue, an issue of fundamental importance. We are here to discuss the direction our country’s military development will take through to 2015. We have already discussed this subject on a number of occasions. We have drawn up and approved the corresponding plans, but developments in the country, developments in the military reform process and the economic development outlook dictate the need for us to constantly come back to this matter and make the required adjustments to our programme.

As I said, and as you know, we are always coming back to the basic issues of building our military organisation. We have approved and are implementing the fundamental provisions of state policy in this area. Our growing economic possibilities are enabling us to channel increasing resources into modernising our Armed Forces.

Our work together has allowed us to make headway in resolving many of the most pressing issues we face. A process of the size and structure of the Armed Forces optimisation is underway.

I would also point out the clear successes we have had in organising operational and combat training. Large-scale, regular, army and navy exercises have resumed after what was too lengthy a hiatus. Progress has been made in establishing a modern social protection system for servicemen and new provisions on providing servicemen with housing through mortgage schemes have come into force.

Note that I say these provisions have come into force, but servicemen are unlikely to have really felt their effect yet. Now we need to ensure that these new provisions start working effectively, and that is the task we have before us. We need to realise that we have so far tackled only the most pressing, most acute, problems, essentially the tactical matters in the modernisation process, and all we have really done so far is stabilise the situation.

Our task today is the transition to consistent development of all the components of our military organisation based on a genuinely long-term strategy. This long-term programme should be based on a clear understanding of the numerous factors making their influence felt today and should be in keeping with the fast-changing situation in the world. We need a precise analysis of the nature of threats such as international terrorism, drug trafficking, technological disasters and social and ethnic conflicts in neighbouring regions — and not to forget that we have still not settled all such problems in our own country. Of course, we also need to keep our powder dry so as to be ready for other tasks of a global nature, and we must never lose sight of this, either. Following this logic, we need to clearly identify the development priorities for our Armed Forces and other security and law enforcement agencies.

Re-equipping the Armed Forces and creating a modern system of rear serevices, material-technical support, intelligence and liaison are all tasks of vital importance. How many times have we talked about the need to develop a unified support system in the rear? I noted that we have had some genuine success, in training, for example, in holding regular, large-scale exercises. But many of the issues we identified together have still, unfortunately, not been settled, including the issue of the rear services. It has been said on many occasions that every agency, every ministry, sets up overlapping structures that operate in parallel and function ineffectively. We do not have such a lot of money and resources at our disposal, and what we do have we are not spending effectively. It would be better to buy some more apartments for servicemen than to maintain an institution that is not in fact needed.

Finally, we need qualitatively new systems of military training and provision of social guarantees for servicemen and civilian personnel.

The second point I wanted to make is that our plans will remain just plans if they do not correspond to the country’s real possibilities and the pace of economic development. This means that our military development policy should be tightly bound to our social and economic development programmes. In this respect I would like to address the Prime Minister, the chairmen of both houses of parliament and the officials in charge of economic matters in the government. We take a lot of decisions regarding our country’s military organisation and then start adjusting and amending them all, partly because the government’s economic officials and the government in general do not present us with sufficiently clear development forecasts. I realise that given the current economic situation in our country and in the world, this is not an easy task, but we will not be able to effectively settle questions of state and military development without clearer forecasts to work with.

My third point is that implementation of the plans we have drawn up requires a process of continual monitoring to ensure that the decisions approved are duly enforced. Continual monitoring is precisely what we need and I have already discussed this matter with many of our colleagues. We will definitely note in our decisions for today and formulate an instruction to the Security Council to present a quarterly progress report on the decisions resulting from today’s meeting.

USA,09-12-2021 00:00,Joe Biden,Remarks by President Biden at a Congressional Tribute Ceremony for Senator Robert J. Dole,"THE PRESIDENT:  Vice President Harris, Speaker Pelosi, Majority Leader Schumer, Minority Leader McConnell, members of Congress, distinguished guests, but most importantly, Elizabeth and Robin — I know this is not easy.  Thank you for letting us do this.
 
We meet here in the very heart of American democracy, the Capitol of the United States of America, to receive a hero of that democracy for a final time: Robert Joseph Dole.  He belongs here, in this place, in this temple of liberty — to liberty and to — temple to possibilities.
 
Bob Dole loved this Capitol.  It’s where he served the nation, shaped by the figures that surround us: Washington and Jefferson, who set us on our path; Abraham Lincoln, another man who — from the Heartland of the country from whence he came; Bob’s hero, Dwight David Eisenhower; Martin Luther King, Jr., whom Bob helped pass legislation honoring the great civil rights leader with a federal holiday — Bob stood up and got that done; Gerald Ford, who served here and with whom Bob sought the vice presidency of the United States.
 
In a sentence: Bob belongs here.  He too was a giant of our history — and that’s not hyperbole; it’s real — of wit and grace, of principle and persistence, of courage and conviction.
 
I had the great honor of serving with Bob, as many of you around this casket have.  I served with him for 25 years. 

He did have great wit.  They once asked him why in God’s name did he vote to continue to fund Amtrak.  He said because if he didn’t, “Biden would stay overnight and cause more trouble.”  (Laughter.)  I commuted every day.  (Laughs.)  It’s a true story.  He was the deciding vote.

Well, you know, Bob and I — like many of us here — we disagreed on a number of things but not on any of the fundamental things.  We still found a way to work together.

We genuinely — we genuinely respected one another as colleagues and as fellow Americans.  It was real; it wasn’t fake.  And we became great friends.
 
And because Bob deserves the final word, I’d like to read a portion of his final message that he left to the country that I hope we all listen to in the days and weeks and months to come. 
 
And I quote Bob Dole:
 
“I cannot pretend that I have not been a loyal champion [of] my party, but [I’ve] always served my country best when I did [it] so first and foremost as an American.”
 
“When we prioritize principles over party and humanity over personal legacy” — when we do that, we “accomplish far more as a nation.  By leading with shared faith in each other, we become America at its best.”  He went on to say, “a beacon of hope, a source of comfort in crisis, a shield against those who threaten freedom.” 
 
“Our nation has certainly faced periods of division.  But at the end of the day, we have always found ways to come together.  We can find that unity again.”
 
And then the message said, end of message.
 
My fellow Americans, America has lost one of our greatest patriots.  We may follow his wisdom, I hope, and his timeless truth.  But the truth of the matter is: As divided as we are, the only way forward for democracy is unity, consensus — the only way.  May we follow his wisdom and his timeless truth and reach consensus on the basic fundamental principles we all agree on.   
 
May God bless Bob Dole.  May God bless America.  And may God protect our troops.",President,Joe Biden,https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/speeches-remarks/2021/12/09/remarks-by-president-biden-at-a-congressional-tribute-ceremony-for-senator-robert-j-dole/,,NATIONALISM

Section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)) provides for the automatic termination of a national emergency unless, within 90 days prior to the anniversary date of its declaration, the President publishes in the Federal Register and transmits to the Congress a notice stating that the emergency is to continue in effect beyond the anniversary date.  In accordance with this provision, I have sent to the Federal Register for publication the enclosed notice stating that the national emergency with respect to the situation in Nicaragua declared in Executive Order 13851 of November 27, 2018, is to continue in effect beyond November 27, 2021.

The situation in Nicaragua, including the violent response by the Government of Nicaragua to the protests that began on April 18, 2018, and the Ortega regime’s systematic dismantling and undermining of democratic institutions and the rule of law, its use of indiscriminate violence and repressive tactics against civilians, as well as its corruption leading to the destabilization of Nicaragua’s economy, continues to pose an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States.  For this reason, I have determined that it is necessary to continue the national emergency declared in Executive Order 13851 with respect to the situation in Nicaragua.

USA,19-08-2021 00:00,Joe Biden,"Statement by President Joseph R. Biden, Jr. on World Humanitarian Day","On this World Humanitarian Day, we pay tribute to the humanitarian workers and everyone on the ground – from all walks of life and nationalities – advocating for and delivering life-saving aid to the most vulnerable every day. We also reaffirm our commitment to put human rights at the center of our foreign policy – not through endless military deployments, but with our diplomacy, our economic tools, supporting aid workers and organizations, and rallying the world to join us.

This year, more than 235 million people in over 56 countries are in need of humanitarian assistance and protection. Aid workers have responded to historic numbers of people fleeing political repression, persecution, armed conflict, gender-based violence, and natural disasters. Add to that the difficulties of facing down a global pandemic and an accelerating climate crisis. Extreme weather can exacerbate forced displacement globally, and climate-related impacts increase the risk to marginalized communities already displaced by conflict. 

Yet, even faced with the unprecedented scope and scale of challenges, humanitarian aid workers across the globe distinguished themselves through their courage, commitment, and drive to help their fellow humans in need – often at extreme personal risk to themselves. Last year, 475 aid workers lost their lives or were injured or kidnapped. The United States stands with our partners around the world to condemn the killing, kidnapping, or any other attack against humanitarian aid workers and we honor the noble service of the many continuing to serve in the face of these threats. Health workers across the globe, disproportionately women, have worked tirelessly on the front lines of the COVID-19 pandemic, delivering care in some of the most challenging environments. When a second major earthquake rocked Haiti, aid workers responded to the call.In Afghanistan, the United States is supporting humanitarians working around the clock to protect the most vulnerable, including women and girls. Aid workers rushed in to provide relief items to those displaced in northern Mozambique as violence reached unprecedented levels. People facing persecution and fleeing the coup and subsequent violence in Burma are receiving critical protection services from aid workers. In Venezuela, Ethiopia and other conflict-afflicted regions, aid workers serve at the frontlines, often at great personal risk, to deliver supplies to the hundreds of thousands of people experiencing famine conditions.  

On this World Humanitarian Day and every day, we stand in solidarity with aid workers and recognize their tremendous service and sacrifice. We celebrate their tireless efforts to save lives, preserve human dignity, and alleviate suffering. Their selfless commitment and actions stand as an example to us all. We will also make sure to have their backs as crises and conflicts arise by leading with our diplomacy and our humanitarian aid.",President,Joe Biden,https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/08/19/statement-by-president-joseph-r-biden-jr-on-world-humanitarian-day/,,OTHERS

Weekly Address: Pursuing a Diplomatic Solution in Syria"," This week, when I addressed the nation on Syria, I said that – in part because of the credible threat of U.S. military force – there is the possibility of a diplomatic solution.  Russia has indicated a new willingness to join with the international community in pushing Syria to give up its chemical weapons, which the Assad regime used in an attack that killed more than 1,000 people on August 21.  I also asked Congress to postpone a vote on the use of military force while we pursue this diplomatic path.  And that’s what we’re doing.   

At my direction, Secretary of State Kerry is in discussions with his Russian counterpart.  But we’re making it clear that this can’t be a stalling tactic.  Any agreement needs to verify that the Assad regime and Russia are keeping their commitments: that means working to turn Syria’s chemical weapons over to international control and ultimately destroying them.  This would allow us to achieve our goal – deterring the Syrian regime from using chemical weapons, degrading their ability to use them, and making it clear to the world that we won’t tolerate their use.

We’ve seen indications of progress.  As recently as a week ago, the Assad regime would not admit that it possessed chemical weapons.  Today, it does.  Syria has signaled a willingness to join with 189 other nations, representing 98 percent of humanity, in abiding by an international agreement that prohibits the use of chemical weapons.  And Russia has staked its own credibility on supporting this outcome.

These are all positive developments.  We’ll keep working with the international community to see that Assad gives up his chemical weapons so that they can be destroyed.  We will continue rallying support from allies around the world who agree on the need for action to deter the use of chemical weapons in Syria.  And if current discussions produce a serious plan, I’m prepared to move forward with it. 

But we are not just going to take Russia and Assad’s word for it.  We need to see concrete actions to demonstrate that Assad is serious about giving up his chemical weapons.  And since this plan emerged only with a credible threat of U.S. military action, we will maintain our military posture in the region to keep the pressure on the Assad regime.  And if diplomacy fails, the United States and the international community must remain prepared to act.

The use of chemical weapons anywhere in the world is an affront to human dignity and a threat to the security of people everywhere.  As I have said for weeks, the international community must respond to this outrage.  A dictator must not be allowed to gas children in their beds with impunity.  And we cannot risk poison gas becoming the new weapon of choice for tyrants and terrorists the world over. 

We have a duty to preserve a world free from the fear of chemical weapons for our children.  But if there is any chance of achieving that goal without resorting to force, then I believe we have a responsibility to pursue that path.  Thank you.

I understand that the President and many of France’s leaders are too busy now for telephone conversations. Therefore, I would like to address Mr President publicly.

Dear Francois,

Russia knows terrorism and the threat it creates for us all. Our people have had to deal with similar tragedies many times, and we are deeply distressed at the news. We would like to express our sympathy and solidarity with the French nation.

The criminal act in Nice that resulted in death and injury, including among Russian citizens, was committed with extreme brutality and cynicism.

I would like to stress again that only through a united effort can we defeat terrorism.

Remarks by the President at Fort Hood Memorial Service"," In our lives -- in our joys and in our sorrows -- we’ve learned that there is “a time for every matter under heaven.”  We laugh and we weep.  We celebrate and we mourn.  We serve in war and we pray for peace.  But Scripture also teaches that, alongside the temporal, one thing is eternal. “Love bears all things, believes all things, hopes all things, endures all things.  Love never ends.”
 
Deputy Secretary Fox; General Dempsey; Secretary McHugh; Generals Odierno and Milley; and most of all, the families of the soldiers who have been taken from us; the wounded -- those who have returned to duty and those still recovering; and the entire community of Fort Hood, this “Great Place”:  It is love, tested by tragedy, that brings us together again.
 
It was love for country that inspired these three Americans to put on the uniform and join the greatest Army that the world has ever known.  Sergeant First Class Daniel Ferguson.  Staff Sergeant Carlos Lazaney-Rodriguez.  Sergeant Timothy Owens. 
 
And Danny and Carlos joined two decades ago, in a time of peace, and stayed as the nation went to war.  Timothy joined after 9/11, knowing he could be sent into harm’s way.  Between them, they deployed nine times.  Each served in Iraq.  Danny came home from Afghanistan just last year.  They lived those shining values -- loyalty, duty, honor -- that keep us strong and free.
 
It was love for the Army that made them the soldiers they were.  For Danny, said his fiancée, being in the Army “was his life.”  Carlos, said a friend, was “the epitome of what you would want a leader to be in the Army.”  Timothy helped counsel his fellow soldiers.  Said a friend, “He was always the person you could go talk to.”
 
And it was love for their comrades, for all of you, that defined their last moments.  As we’ve heard, when the gunman tried to push his way into that room, Danny held the door shut, saving the lives of others while sacrificing his own.  And it’s said that Timothy -- the counselor, even then -- gave his life, walking toward the gunman, trying to calm him down. 
 
For you, their families, no words are equal to your loss.  We are here on behalf of the American people to honor your loved ones and to offer whatever comfort we can.  But know this:  We also draw strength from you.  For even in your grief, even as your heart breaks, we see in you that eternal truth: “Love never ends.”
 
To the parents of these men -- as a father, I cannot begin to fathom your anguish.  But I know that you poured your love and your hopes into your sons.  I know that the men and soldiers they became -- their sense of service and their patriotism -- so much of that came from you.  You gave your sons to America, and just as you will honor them always, so, too, will the nation that they served.
 
To the loves of their lives -- Timothy’s wife Billy and Danny’s fiancée Kristen -- these soldiers cherished the Army, but their hearts belonged to you.  And that’s a bond that no earthly power can ever break.  They have slipped from your embrace, but know that you will never be alone.  Because this Army and this nation stands with you for all the days to come.
 
To their children -- we live in a dangerous world, and your fathers served to keep you safe and us safe.  They knew you have so much to give our country; that you’d make them proud.  Timothy’s daughter Lori already has.  Last Wednesday night, she posted this message online: “I just want everyone to think for a moment.”  Love your family, she said, “because you never know when [they’re] gonna be taken from you.  I love you, daddy.”
 
And to the men and women of Fort Hood -- as has already been mentioned, part of what makes this so painful is that we have been here before.  This tragedy tears at wounds still raw from five years ago.  Once more, soldiers who survived foreign warzones were struck down here at home, where they’re supposed to be safe.  We still do not yet know exactly why, but we do know this:  We must honor their lives, not “in word or talk, but in deed and in truth.”
 
We must honor these men with a renewed commitment to keep our troops safe, not just in battle but on the home front, as well.  In our open society, and at vast bases like this, we can never eliminate every risk.  But as a nation, we can do more to help counsel those with mental health issues, to keep firearms out of the hands of those who are having such deep difficulties.  As a military, we must continue to do everything in our power to secure our facilities and spare others this pain.
 
We must honor these men by doing more to care for our fellow Americans living with mental illness, civilian and military.  Today, four American soldiers are gone.  Four Army families are devastated.  As Commander-in-Chief, I’m determined that we will continue to step up our efforts -- to reach our troops and veterans who are hurting, to deliver to them the care that they need, and to make sure we never stigmatize those who have the courage to seek help.
 
And finally, we must honor these men by recognizing that they were members of a generation that has borne the burden of our security in more than a decade of war.  Now our troops are coming home, and by the end of this year our war in Afghanistan will finally be over.
 
In an era when fewer Americans know someone in uniform, every American must see these men and these women -- our 9/11 Generation -- as the extraordinary citizens that they are.  They love their families.  They excel at their jobs.  They serve their communities.  They are leaders.  And when we truly welcome our veterans home, when we show them that we need them -- not just to fight in other countries, but to build up our own -- then our schools and our businesses, our communities and our nation will be more successful, and America will be stronger and more united for decades to come.

Like the 576 Fort Hood soldiers who have given their lives in Iraq and Afghanistan, they were taken from us much too soon.  Like the 13 Americans we lost five years ago, their passing shakes our soul.  And in moments such as this, we summon once more what we’ve learned in these hard years of war.  We reach within our wounded hearts.  We lean on each other.  We hold each other up.  We carry on.  And with God’s amazing grace, we somehow bear what seems unbearable. 
 
“Love bears all things, believes all things, hopes all things, endures all things.  Love never ends.”  May God watch over these American soldiers, may He keep strong their families whose love endures, and may God continue to bless the United States of America with patriots such as these.

Russia,13-09-2011,Dmitry Medvedev,Meeting on students' welfare,"Good afternoon,

I said recently that I was planning to devote some time to meetings on students’ problems. The new academic year has started, which in itself is a good reason to review a wide range of issues, from education to students’ daily routines, their leisure activities – in short, everything that is related to student life.

Today we are joined at this meeting by representatives of student organisations and rectors of some universities. I hope that today's meeting – it is our first on this subject – will be devoted to the most essential problems of student life and various proposals to address these problems.

Russia has more than nine million students, which is 6% of the population. I think this is a very substantial figure if we compare Russia with other countries. It is vitally important for the country that young people receive the kind of education that is most in demand and later take up competitive positions in the economy and social sphere, that they become modern, thinking and creative people who have the opportunity for self-realisation. These words may sound commonplace but they are absolutely accurate nonetheless.

As you know, the draft law on education being currently debated sets out new approaches to quality education, and that is very important. But, as I said, student life is equally important because ultimately it affects their studies. Everyone who has ever been a university student understands that. Therefore, a great deal depends on the living conditions in student accommodation, on the sports facilities at the university and on the state of the canteen.

Therefore I propose that we focus on several issues.

The first thing that is of great concern to students is the financial aspect and their scholarships. The scholarships students receive today are not very big, 1,200 rubles. Scholarships were always modest, also at the time when I was a student, but in comparison with the purchasing power today, in real terms scholarships have become smaller than they were in Soviet times. Nevertheless, in September, scholarships were raised by 9%. The scholarship fund for the most successful students has increased by 20%. Scholarships will be paid out in accordance with the criteria set out by the Russian Union of Student Organisations. I believe it will depend on academic and other achievements, including sports.

    ”It is vitally important for the country that young people receive the kind of education that is most in demand and later take up competitive positions in the economy and social sphere.“

I would also like to announce that 10 minutes ago I signed an Executive Order on awarding scholarships to students enrolled in higher education institutions which train personnel for the five priority areas for the modernisation of our economy. These scholarships will be paid out from 2012 and the students at these schools will receive 7,000 rubles, while graduate students will get 14,000 rubles. Also, on my instructions government scholarships will be paid to undergraduate and graduate students in the amount of 5,000 and 10,000 rubles, respectively. Considering the size of the academic community, these figures may not be very big, but I emphasise that these scholarships will be paid for outstanding achievements in science and education.

In addition to state scholarships there may be other ways of encouraging students. We all realise that the majority of countries don’t have big scholarships either, and some countries don’t have them at all. In order to improve the situation, I think business could play a more active role because ultimately, it has great demand for university graduates. The business community is interested in student training – in quality personnel, of course, not just any kind.

I would also like to hear from you about the situation at your universities, the role of student organisations in addressing these problems, and your views on other issues.

Another long-standing and very complex matter is student accommodation. It's no secret that many student halls were built decades ago, some even hundreds of years ago, and they are morally and physically obsolete. I remember my own student years. The dormitories at Leningrad State University were appalling. I am from St Petersburg so I lived at home, but when I went to the dorm to visit my friends I couldn’t believe that people not only slept there but they also studied and managed to learn something and get good marks. That is how it was then and unfortunately, the situation has not changed much. This does not mean that there are no new dormitories. New universities have new student accommodation and some universities have renovated old facilities but the situation still remains difficult. Therefore, we must not only renovate the existing buildings, but also to build new dormitories, which meet the current sanitary standards and safety requirements.

Student accommodation must be comfortable. There is no need for luxury – just look at dormitories in other countries — but they must have the infrastructure that today's students need to be able to study. There must be a gym, a medical facility, study rooms, Internet connection (that is not even being discussed) and a kitchen for cooking healthy food.

However, our ultimate goal should be to create what top universities in developed countries have: university campuses. New universities and their campuses are being built in line with this principle. I am referring to the Far Eastern Federal University campus on Russky Island: in addition to comfortable rooms it has a swimming pool and a stadium, and a medical centre. Naturally, this is a completely new facility and no expense was spared in building it so that when it is completed, I’m certain that it will be a very popular and exclusive academic institution in the best sense of the word.

There are plans to build campuses at other universities as well, in particular at the National University of Science and Technology MISIS, and at other universities, not only in Moscow or the Far East. However, I reiterate that the situation with student accommodation and campuses is still very complicated.

A very important topic is monitoring students’ health because, obviously, the students who work hard put a lot of energy and health into their studies. We must also look at the way medical services are provided, how students feel and the state of their health when they graduate. We must expand the network of student health resorts and prevention clinics where possible. There is a great deal to talk about regarding this matter.

    ”I signed an Executive Order on awarding scholarships to students enrolled in higher education institutions which train personnel for the five priority areas for the modernisation of our economy. These scholarships will be paid out from 2012.“

I would like to emphasise once again that the solution to this problem is not entirely up to the federal government, especially since not all universities are financed by the federal centre; a great deal depends on the regional authorities. I hope that the governors present here today will say a few words about their plans to address these problems.

That is all I wanted to say to begin with. I would like us to discuss the advisability of using different loan mechanisms and subsidies to address the problems with housing, food, transportation costs and education services, and which mechanisms can be used to make tuition-based education more affordable. I invite all of you to join in the discussion.

I am not going to call the speakers from the list. Let’s have a free discussion, so please raise your hands, and I mean both the rectors and representatives of the student community. Go ahead, please.

<…>

Dmitry Medvedev: Colleagues, a lot was said today. I would like to start by saying that the discussion on this topic will continue. Nonetheless, we heard a few ideas which, I feel, it is imperative to develop further. To be more specific, I will certainly instruct the Presidential Executive Office and the Cabinet to study all of the ideas mentioned today, but some of them deserve particular attention. I will highlight a few of them.

First of all, with regard to the National Final School Exam. This has not been the first time I’ve heard positive remarks in the last two or three weeks – not about the exam itself, which has been subject to quite a bit of criticism, but about the potential this national exam opens up for provincial universities and high school students who go to school in villages and small towns in rural areas. In my view, this is very good, and indeed, that is one of the reasons that the final school exam has been implemented. The figures presented by colleagues, demonstrating an increase in the number of prospective students arriving from relatively small towns, are a good sign. Indeed, these figures represent the new blood we needed to get through the changes in our testing system.

Many people spoke about good projects implemented by employers, particularly within the framework of sector-specific education systems – what employers are doing to ensure to keep the that good college and graduate students. Naturally, all of this should be supported as much as possible. And if everything is as you say, then we need to maintain this trend and try to subsequently achieve good employment indicators on this basis as well.

With regard to dormitories. I will give instructions on analysing non-standard approaches to redesigning dormitories and building new ones. Some people asked, why aren’t we doing this or that, why aren’t we using those examples? Let’s look into all approaches from the angle of legal feasibility and economic efficacy. If anything needs to be adjusted in our legislative acts, we can do that, too. In any case, I believe all means that lead to resolving this problem are good. If, in the future, dormitories are turned into something different, such as residential houses, even that is a possibility.

One example is what we’re currently doing on Russky Island, where dormitories being constructed for athletes and students will first be used to accommodate the upcoming APEC forum participants. My point is that dormitories can initially be constructed for other purposes. As far as I know, in Kazan, similar dormitories are being built to house athletes at the Universiade. Later, they can also be appropriated to universities. I think it would be best to combine these kinds of approaches and thereby create new opportunities for housing students.

I am also not against looking into investor contracts and corresponding programmes that already exist, but colleagues, you understand – this can only happen within the framework of opportunities currently available.

The young people representing our student community spoke extensively about introducing student government and a corresponding regulatory framework. I support doing this as quickly as possible, including the issuance of a law on student government. Is it currently in the State Duma?

[Minister of Education and Science] Andrei Fursenko: There is a special article in the new law.

Dmitry Medvedev: The law on education?

Andrei Fursenko: Yes, in the law on education. We can expand it.

Dmitry Medvedev: Well, it makes no difference to me how you proceed in terms of legal technicalities. This could be a new law, or it can be articulated in the draft law you are currently working on. In any event, we need to include some specific provisions with regard to student government. At the same time, as far as I understand, this should involve a system of regulations concerning student government: some general positions should be stated in the law on education or in some special law, whereas more detailed points concerning particular universities can be stipulated in their respective statutes, since regulations on student governments can vary. Every university will have its own particularities. These are the very university freedoms which must exist and which help reflect the specifics of student life in a given region or a given university.

The problem of season travel cards does indeed exist, and this is not the first time I’m hearing about it from students. Let’s do the following. We will give instructions in Moscow, Moscow Region, St Petersburg and Leningrad Region, as well as other regions in the Russian Federation, to look into the possibility of introducing season travel cards for students, at least for certain seasons, and submit their ideas and proposal on this matter.

I already talked about student government.

With regard to post-graduate training. I gave instructions to the Defence Ministry to ensure that all full-time post-graduate students are not drafted. There are no objections to this, nor should there be. We simply need to monitor how this will actually be carried out. It concerns all universities that have post-graduate students, and not just ones that have corresponding exemptions from military duty. Because post-graduate students are not college students; they are young scientists, and it is imperative that we create all the necessary conditions to ensure that they complete and defend their thesis.

As far as the unfortunate registration issues are concerned, to be quite frank, I still do not fully understand the main problems. Nevertheless, I will give the Federal Migration Service (FMS) instructions to find some way to combine these approaches, so that the FMS can work in a proper way with higher education institutions, ensuring that they all have equal status and do not depend on particular agreements involving particular rectors.

I already spoke about student government. It’s true that we really need to think about broadening the horizons and possibilities of student government, which includes some fairly delicate, sensitive matters that, incidentally, did not exist in the previous education system, such as a student’s transfer from paying to non-paying status. Right now, as far as I understand, this occurs at the university administration’s prerogative. Who makes those decisions?

Andrei Fursenko: The rector’s office, but we gave recommendations for them to take into account the recommendations of student organisations.

Dmitry Medvedev: I think this is quite important, because we understand how sensitive an issue this is. A person paid money, but after he or she changes status, he or she can stop paying. This event is very important for students, particularly if they have financial difficulties. And in this case, we need to ensure that these decisions are taken in an atmosphere of transparency; they must be clear not just to the teaching staff or the administration of higher education institutions, but to students as well, to ensure that no tension is created. The same is true for scholarships.

With regard to expenditures, the issues brought up by our colleagues representing student unions. I don’t know about the concrete facts you presented, although at the very least, this looks quite strange, particularly with regard to the purchases of expensive cars for the Customs Academy. If they are purchased so that other Federal Customs Service structures can use them, then that is simply wrong, because if they need cars, then they should buy them centrally – preferably reasonable cars at a reasonable cost. And if they are being purchased directly for the academy (did I understand you correctly?), then at the very least, there is cause for investigation. I would like the head of the Customs Service to answer the question of why the Customs Academy has purchased so many Mercedes, and anything else they may have purchased.

I think it’s a very good idea to create some kind of programme for all universities to have high-quality, high-speed wireless Internet. In the past, we put our efforts into connecting schoolchildren to the Internet, and now we should do the same for university students. Naturally, it would be good to have Wi-Fi at our schools as well, but I think it is only really necessary for high school students, whereas university students need Wi-Fi 24 hours per day all throughout the university campus: in classrooms and in the dorms. This is something that could become a major government programme. We just need to think about how to implement it, and what funding and procedures we would use.

I am not against defining students’ social status, although things rarely change as a result of how we define status, but nevertheless, perhaps from a legal standpoint, this may clarify some status issues in order to make it clear what rights, obligations and privileges all students should have. Maybe we need to do this, though it seemed to me that we have such a status already. But if changes need to be made, let’s look into it.

With regard to student representation and quotas within collegial authority, I support broadening student presence as much as possible, but at the same time, not so much that it paralyses work. After all, a collegiate authority’s job is to govern, and a student’s job is to learn, rather than govern along with the teaching staff and university administration.

I am not certain that we can turn the issue of university dining into a national project, as we once did with school meals, since these are somewhat different things. Schoolchildren are still very young and small; they are citizens of our nation who need constant monitoring and care, and our schools are very different from universities. After all, college students are independent adults. On the other hand, we really do need to think about how to create standards for student dining. Cleary, each individual will make a decision depending on his or her needs and capabilities, including financial ones, but we should have certain standards. I will once again recall my own student days. There was an enormous amount of variation in the food provided at my alma mater, Leningrad State University, which like all major universities is scattered across different parts of the city. You enter one cafeteria, and it’s simply inedible, it’s poisonous, but you go into another one, and the food is pretty decent. So we need to ensure that we adhere to some reasonable standards.

With regard to the specific topic of military educational institutions and what was said by Vasily Golubev, Governor of Rostov Region: naturally, I will give instructions, but I think that this is more of a general topic. My governor and rector colleagues, we need to see what opportunities are available, for example, at military educational institutions that are closing. And if, for whatever reason, it really would be expedient to make them available to civil educational institutions, we can do that. The question of money being given to the Defence Ministry is, of course, an important one, but it is not a decisive one. Taking money from one place and, for example, spending it to develop student dormitories, while giving a particular ministry the chance to make money, is wrong, these processes can be reconciled.

As far as sports and recreation are concerned, summer vacations at health and recreation resorts are a very important topic. The only issue is that the state of these resorts leaves something to be desired. But in cases when universities are able to maintain these resorts through various means, it is preferable to continue running them, because after all, many students do not have the resources to do this on their own. And these existing resorts are important.

With regard to sports, Valery Shantsev is right: we need to combine our universities’ capabilities with those of the regions. It is not necessary for each university to have its own sports and recreation centre. It would be good, of course, if the university has a campus and that campus has a pool and some other athletic facilities. But it’s not realistic to have that everywhere. In many cases, it is much more expedient to associate a university with a particular municipal or regional sports and recreation centre, but to do so while assuring the centre is accessible to students. They shouldn’t be charged an arm and a leg, and regions should introduce some reduced-rate student passes to sports and recreation centres, the way they usually do it for schoolchildren.

I already spoke about new mechanisms for building dormitories. I would like this to be reflected in my next set of instructions.

I suppose it’s fair to ask about how universities’ financial opportunities are affected by the entering students’ National Final School Exam (EGE) results, because however you spin it, this concerns universities’ prestige or standing. If a university is not very good, it will attract less-talented students. This is absolutely clear. We must think about how we will handle this issue. I think if we believe EGE results are generally objective then this objectivity should be applied to measure universities, in a more concrete way.

There is the particular topic of clinics separating from medical universities. I know about this. I was talking with the medical community, the rectors of other medical universities. You know, we should strive toward maintaining these clinics’ association with medical universities, because they serve as a kind of laboratory where university students can train. However, these clinics need to be modern, not some kind of pit where people are afraid to get treatment; instead, they should resemble normal medical facilities. We need this kind of foundation; this is truly the universal experience.

And finally, with regard to the dormitories that are almost ready. I support the idea that we need to channel money first and foremost toward dormitories that are close to completion. However, we also need to look at the dormitories themselves. If, for example, a dormitory is intended for fifteen thousand individuals, while the university has three thousand students enrolled, then it’s probably wrong to finance that dorm. But if the size of the dorm conforms to the number of students – that is the order of priority we should establish.

Colleagues, I would like to thank all of you for your participation in the discussion. Let me emphasise again that this is only our first meeting. I will issue relevant instructions this month based on the results of our today’s work.

Goodbye.",President,Dmitry Medvedev,http://en.kremlin.ru/events/president/transcripts/statements/12672,,DEVELOPMENT
United Kingdom,28-Jun-11,David Cameron,Speech at the Local Government Association conference,"Introduction It’s great to be back at the LGA conference. And I want to congratulate Sir Merrick Cockell on his appointment as Chair of the Local Government Association. Today, I want to talk about the big issue of the week - the reform of public service pensions. But before I do that, let me say something about local government. I want it put on record: I think you are doing a brilliant job in challenging circumstances. I know it was a tough financial settlement. And I know you are all grappling with some really difficult decisions. When your budget is being cut, freezing council tax isn’t easy. But because of the action that’s been taken, by everyone in this room, a typical family in a Band D home will save up to £72 over the next year. You did that - and it’s something you should be proud of. But there will be many more tough decisions in the weeks and months ahead. And my job is to make your job less difficult, not more. And I believe, as a government, we’re going some way to doing that. So much of that bureaucracy that drove you mad and cost you so much time and money in administration - it’s going. The Comprehensive Area Assessments, the Place Surveys and Local Area Agreements - we’ve got rid of them. Quangos like the Audit Commission and Standards Board - we’re scrapping them. And regional Spatial Strategies, Regional Fire Control Rooms, Government Offices for the Regions - they’re going too. We don’t need regional government. The public want - you want, I want - local government. What’s more, we’re also phasing out that ring-fencing that made you spend money with one hand behind your back. In every way we can, we’re rooting out the red tape and regulation and freeing your hands from the grip of central government control. At the same time as this, we’re actively giving you new powers and freedoms - trusting you to get on with the job. I believe that our agenda of localism is one the most exciting things we are doing in government. For years, the default position of government has been to see a problem and suck more power to the centre. We want to be different. Very different. When we see a problem, we don’t ask what central government can do… …we ask what can local people do, what can councils do? It’s by asking those questions that you arrive at so many of our reforms. Our new general power of competence means councils can develop property, run new services and own assets. Our new Health and Wellbeing Boards mean you can take a leading role in developing a public health strategy for your local residents. And our new Local Enterprise Partnerships has seen many of you take control of your local area’s economic destiny. These are already gathering real momentum. Like in Tees Valley, where local councils have pooled their budgets and got together with business to draw up a plan to make that place a hub for green industry. This is what you do when you get more power - you get things done. Another way you’re doing this is through community budgets. We’re saying to local authorities and local public services: here is the freedom to put all your different strands of cash in one pot… …go and tackle some of most stubborn social problems the way you think is best. It’s already having an impact. In Islington, the council, NHS, Job Centre Plus, Probation, Police, housing and voluntary sector have pooled staff and over £6 million worth of resources to give the most hard-to-reach families the most intensive and personalized support possible. Again, we’re giving you the power - and you’re getting things done. So for me, it’s not a question of: should we give councils more power? It’s: how far and how fast can we go? And we are not stopping this power shift at the Town Hall. We are going even further, taking people power to the next level… …from councils to neighbourhoods, communities and individuals. Whether it’s letting people set up new schools… …take over the running of playgrounds, parks and post offices… …hold beat meetings so they can ask police officers what they’re doing… …or plan the look, size, shape and feel of local developments… …we believe in changing the way our country is run. But let me say this. Yes, we’re giving you this power. And yes, we’re doing that because we trust you. But no, that doesn’t mean there shouldn’t be a frank exchange of views between us. Of course, the only people you have to answer to are your voters. The same is true for us in Central government. But I’m happy for you to turn round and say so when you think we in central government have the wrong priorities. And if I see things you’re doing that I don’t like, I think you should be comfortable if I make my opinions known too. That doesn’t mean I want us locking horns on an ongoing basis. In fact quite the opposite. I hope our relationship can be as constructive and co-operative as possible But we live in a new world of council power… …and it’s time for a new relationship between central and local government, based on our new responsibilities. Public Service Pensions So I’ve said something about the great job you’re doing. I now want to turn to a job we’ve got to do together - and that is reforming public service pensions. Over the past few months, I believe we have been acting in good faith on this issue. We asked Lord Hutton, a Labour peer - and a former Work and Pensions Secretary with a brilliant understanding of the detail - to conduct the Review. We wanted him to build proposals that would be well thought through and maximise the chance cross-party consensus. And we have met with union leaders regularly to discuss the issues in a good, open, frank and respectful fashion - and will continue to do so. Of course, because it is a funded scheme, the Local Government Pension Scheme is different from other public sector pension schemes. That’s why we will have a more in-depth discussion with local government unions and the TUC about how we take this into account. But the broad thrust of the wider reforms we are proposing will affect people in this room and your workforces. So it’s right that I speak about this issue here - and it’s right that I speak about it now. In two days time, a minority of unions will go on strike in opposition to our proposals. Of course, in a democracy, people can go out and protest. But the people marching should know what they’re objecting to, and I believe there are some misconceptions flying around. So today, I want to tell you the three things people need to know. One - reform is essential. Two - our proposals are fair on the taxpayer. Three - our proposals are fair on public sector workers. Let me take each in turn. Essential First, reform is essential because we just can’t go on as we are. That’s not because, as some people say, public service pensions are ridiculously generous. In fact, around half of public service pensioners receive less than £6,000 a year. No. The reason we can’t go on as we are is because as the baby boomers retire - and thankfully live longer - the pension system is in danger of going broke. Here’s a key fact. In the 1970s, when a civil servant say retired at sixty, they could expect to claim a pension for around twenty years. Today, when they retire at sixty, they can expect to claim a pension for nearly thirty years - about a fifty percent increase on before. Now, obviously, more people living for longer is a great development for society. But more people claiming their pension for longer has a real life impact on our ability to pay for pensions. Indeed, we are already seeing the impact. In 2009, total payments to public service pensioners and their dependents were almost £32 billion - an increase of a third, even after allowing for inflation, compared to 1999. So what are we going to do? In the words of Lord Hutton, “the responsible thing to do is to accept that because we are living longer we should work for longer”. That’s why we are proposing to increase the age when public sector employees can take their pension. Now, I know some people say this change should only affect new entrants to the pension scheme. But I’m sorry, I just don’t think that’s right. It’s not just the people who are joining the workforce now who are living longer. We’re all living longer - so we must all play our part in dealing with this problem. Fair for taxpayer The second thing people need to know is that our proposals are fair on other taxpayers. Under the current system, the balance between what public sector employees pay in to their pensions and what the taxpayer contributes is getting massively out of kilter. Take, for example, the Civil Service Pensions Scheme. Today, employees contribute around 1.5 and 3.5 percent towards their own pension. The taxpayer, however, contributes nineteen percent. Indeed, in total, the taxpayer currently contributes over two-thirds of the costs of maintaining public sector pensions. That’s the equivalent of £1,000 a household. That figure is only expected to rise. Is that a fair? I don’t believe it is, especially when people in the private sector are seeing the value of their own pensions falling, their own pension age rise… …and when, according to the Office for National Statistics, the average gross pay in the public sector is now higher than in the private sector. So we need to rebalance the system. That’s why from April next year, we are proposing to increase the contributions public sector workers have to make to their pension. And because we really want to protect the lower paid, we propose not to increase contributions at all for those earning £15,000 or less a year. Fair on public sector workers Third, our proposals are also fair on public sector workers. Now I know a lot of people are hearing scare stories about our proposals… …about how we are closing defined benefit schemes and replacing them with defined contribution schemes. Well, here is the plain, irreducible truth: public service pension schemes will remain defined benefit. This means every public sector worker will receive a guaranteed amount in retirement… …not an uncertain amount based on the value of an investment fund like most people in the private sector. Any suggestion otherwise is completely untrue. And any suggestion that we are stripping workers of the benefits they have already accumulated is untrue too. With our proposals, what you have already earned, you will keep. We will protect, in full, the pension you have already built up, and we will maintain the final salary link for these benefits. What would this mean in practice? It means the ‘final salary’ which is used to calculate your pension will not be the salary you’re on now, will not be the salary you have when the new scheme comes in… …it will be the one you have when you eventually decide to retire or leave the scheme altogether. And for what you have already built up, the age at which you can claim those benefits is not changing. That part of your pension, those past entitlements… …what they allow you to have… …are yours and they will not change. So those people who are claiming otherwise… …are not just getting their facts wrong… …they are giving really bad advice to teachers, nurses and the police officers who are wondering whether to continue with their pension. Let me tell you how it is. Anyone with a public service career ahead of them who carries on contributing to their pension will be better off for doing so. Fact Defined benefit is staying. Fact. Your pre-reform entitlements are being fully protected. What you have earned you will keep. Fact. That’s why I can look you in the eye and say public service pensions will remain among the very best… …much better, indeed, than for many private sector workers. And it’s because we are determined to do what’s fair by people who work in the public sector that we are suggesting other changes. The public service pensions system today is inherently biased against some of the lowest paid workers. That’s because, under a final salary scheme, it’s the people who reach very high salaries at the end of their careers who benefit the most. Yes, these are talented people. And yes, they are hugely important to the running of our public services. But the way the system works, it’s not the community nurse who retires on a final salary of £28,000 who gets the benefit… …but the hospital consultant who leaves on a final salary of £110,000. Indeed, in some instances, for every £100 they put in their pension, higher earners can get twice as much out. Is this fair? No. It’s not. So again, in accordance with the recommendations of Lord Hutton, we are proposing to replace the final salary scheme with a Career Average scheme. This would mean that the lowest-paid do not subsidise those individuals who jump to higher salaries in the last few years of their career. And it would mean that everyone will get broadly the same amount for every pound they put in. This is not about saving money. It’s about doing what’s right and fair by you. As Danny Alexander recently set out, our proposals mean that low and middle income workers will receive a pension that is at least as good as what they have now. Conclusion Let me end by saying this. I know why people care so much about this issue. The provision of good, high quality public service pensions goes to the heart of the kind of society we are. It’s a vital part of the contract between all those who work in our schools and hospitals, fire stations and police stations, councils and prisons… …and the rest of the country. It’s about saying: you’ve spent your career serving others; so we will look after you in old age. And I am determined to not just meet that contract, but to strengthen it. But here’s the truth. That won’t happen if we delay action, or even worse refuse to act. All that will mean is a worse pension system in five, ten, fifteen years time as the obligations become unaffordable. The fact is we will only meet and strengthen that contract through change. And the changes we propose are a good deal. They are fair for the lower paid and fair on the taxpayer. They secure affordable pensions not just now, but for decades to come. And they mean public service pensions will remain among the very best available. So to those considering strike action, at a time when discussions are ongoing, I would say to you: these strikes are wrong - for you, for the people you serve, for the good of the country. It’s the changes we propose that are right. Right for the long-term. Right by the taxpayer. And most crucially of all, right by you.",Prime Minister,David Cameron,https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/speech-at-the-local-government-association-conference,,OTHERS
Russia,29-08-2001,Vladimir Putin,Opening Remarks at a Meeting of the State Council on Modernization of the Education System,"The development of education is not just about the prestige of our country, important as it is. The development of education is a nationwide task. We have always kept the bar high, but the height is not an end in itself, it is a guarantee of the successful development of the state and society. But it can only be so if education meets the general standards of today, if it is accessible and if its quality is high.

We see that putting the issue on the agenda of the State Council has ushered in a new stage in the broad public discussion, an acute and frank discussion. The activities of the working group have shown that it is a theme that engages the minds of practically everyone in the country, which is why our future work should be as open and transparent as possible.

I would like to stress that what is clear and obvious to the many professionals present here who have dealt with the problem for many years, is by no means clear to every citizen. Yet it should be clear to all.

Before we open the discussion I would like to make some preliminary remarks.

Admittedly, our education system is superior in many ways to those of foreign counterparts. This is borne out by the steady demand abroad for graduates of our higher education institutions. But one can hardly deny that we have not yet learned to derive the maximum benefit from these advantages.

Meanwhile education occupies one of the leading places in the world economy, it has long become an expensive and most valuable commodity, and sustained development of countries has long depended not so much on their resources as on the level of education. And indeed, what is the use of oil, gas, metals and other minerals if there is no one to extract and process them and even sell them well. What use is all that?

Second. Economic modernization demands structural change in the system of vocational education, which should be professional in the broadest sense of the word.

Today this system takes little notice of the labour market. As a result, we have a lot of people with a higher education, but we are desperately short of truly modern specialists, as you know. Big companies already today pay huge amounts of money employing tens and hundreds of foreign specialists.

I think the experiences of some domestic corporations which have launched their own large-scale information and education projects merit attention. I believe that businessmen and their organizations could take a more active part in the reform of vocational education.

A third important problem is making education accessible.

People should have a clear idea where they can count on government support and the government must know to what extent and how it must interfere in the sphere of education and where citizens can and must rely on their own efforts and potential.

I would like to stress however that free education is the cornerstone of our government policy. But we should not turn a blind eye to another thing. Fee-paying education is also developing and it must at long last have an adequate legal and organizational form. If it is paid for, then it should be absolutely transparent and understandable. Everybody must know what he or she pays for, how much they pay and what they will gain as a result; no underground schemes should exist.

The important thing is that both forms – paid and free – provide quality education. I expect the Government and the working group to present their views on these key issues today.

Another problem directly linked with guaranteed education is national education standards. The need to introduce them has been mooted for many years. I am referring to a new system of requirements to teachers and school leaders.

The completion of that task has been unpardonably delayed. The lack of such standards means that the government has still not made up its mind about its obligations in this sphere. We still don’t know exactly the type, quality and volume of educational services that the country and its economy really need. So far such standards are non-existent and many discussions of education reform simply make no sense, including the discussion of the 12-year secondary school that has been taking place among teachers and parents for several years now.

I am convinced that it is high time to establish a reasonable balance between universal and fundamental knowledge and the pragmatic kind of education geared to the real needs of the national economy.

Working out national education standards is not something that can be done by just one agency. Teachers and scientists and possibly the National Education Council, which has recently been much debated, and whose relevance and possible functions and areas of activity have been questioned – all should work actively together.

Often the shortage of budget financing is named as the key and the only problem of education. Granted, that is always important. Financing problems have always existed and will exist.

But there is another side to the matter. The resources the central and local governments, individuals and enterprises put in the education system are still not being used effectively. One possible answer is to abandon financing the cost estimates of educational establishments in favour of financing quotas per student. In this approach, money follows the student and is not “diluted” in the total estimate of the cost of running a school.

A good educational institution is in demand in the market, it attracts people, and government resources are allocated based on the number of students. If students do not come, funding is diminished. Obviously, in some spheres of activity the government will continue to provide the bulk of financial support for this or that institution or this or that type of activity. It is still a debatable issue that calls for serious thought, as the discussion within the working group has demonstrated. There have been a lot of arguments.

I would like to mention the problem of the responsibility of all the levels of government for the education process. It is a joint responsibility of the Federation and the regions. We have talked a lot recently about the need to delimit the spheres and levels of responsibility. The fewer the areas of shared responsibility the better. Yet we recognise that such areas cannot be completely eliminated. I think education could provide an optimum model of delimitation of terms of reference with maximum effectiveness and benefit for all the levels of government.

Finally, I think it is necessary to mention one other topic. And that is the introduction of modern information technologies in education. You know that this is a critical issue.

Thirty years ago a nationwide drive was proclaimed with the aim of “computerizing the whole country”. The gap between this grandiose plan and its results is known. We have no right to repeat the same negative experience.

Many new challenges face the education sphere. No wonder the preparation of the working group’s report to the State Council has not been simple, I am told. Different points of view, often mutually exclusive points of view, were voiced during the discussion. I think work on new agreed approaches should continue, but not endlessly.

I am convinced that education cannot be seen only as accumulation of knowledge. In modern conditions it is above all the development of analytical skills and critical thinking, instilling the ability to learn and acquire knowledge and keep abreast of changes.

These abilities can be instilled only by a new kind of teacher. All education reforms would be doomed if the teacher does not change and the conditions of his work and life do not change. The teacher’s prestige depends not least on his or her salary and material wellbeing, but not only on that. Respect is generated by professional competence. Only then will we get a teaching profession that will enjoy a high social status. It has always been that way in Russia. Only then can we be absolutely sure of the success of this important area of public life.

In my opening remarks I have touched only upon some aspects I think are the most important. I hope that our conversation will have a wider range.

In conclusion I would like to stress that the government’s education policy must be understandable to every Russian citizen and feasible in practice. Ultimately, it should be effective, feasible and accessible.

Thank you.",President,Vladimir Putin,http://en.kremlin.ru/events/president/transcripts/statements/21312,,DEVELOPMENT
Russia,07-04-2007 00:00,Vladimir Putin,Speech at the 119th International Olympic Committee session,"Mr. President, Members of the international Olympic Committee, ladies and gentlemen.

It is a great honor for me to address you today and to present the bid of Sochi to host the Olympic Winter Games in 2014.

The bid has enthusiastic support of the whole of Russia.

We pledge to make the stay of Olympians and Paralimpians, spectators, journalists, guests in Sochi a safe, enjoyable and memorable experience.

Sochi is a unique place. On the seashore you can enjoy a fine spring day. But up in the mountains it’s winter.

I went skiing there six or seven weeks ago, and I know – real snow’s guaranteed.

The ancient Greeks lived around Sochi. I also saw the rock near Sochi to which as legend has it Prometheus was chained. It was Prometheus who gave people fire, fire which ultimately is the Olympic flame.

We guarantee that the Olympic cluster in Sochi will be completed on time. We are allocating a round sum of 12 billion dollars for this.

The cluster is going to become a regional, national and international sports venue. Special emphasis is placed on environment, security, infrastructure, up-to-date means of mass communication.

70 percent of participants will be housed within a five-minute walking distance of the competition venues. Five-minute walking distance. Not bad.

Ladies and gentlemen!

The city of Sochi has exclusive offers: We are working on a list of special privileges for participants and guests of the Games.

For example we plan to lift all restrictions on the minimum stay for delegations. This will be backed up by a special law.

(I have already signed a Decree to this effect).

And one more special privilege:

No traffic jams! I promise!

You may know that we in Russia turn a sports competition into a really spectacular event. And we are good at it. In the past 25 years we have had more than a hundred major competitions.

The recent World Ice Hockey Championship in Moscow was a big success.

Russia is ready to host Winter Olympic and Paralympic Games in 2014. The Olympic family is going to feel at home in Sochi.

Mr. President, members of the International Olympic Committee, ladies and gentlemen!

Millions of citizens of Russia are united by the Olympic dream. Winter sports are very popular in Russia. Our athletes have scored many victories and have made major contributions to the Olympic Movement.

But we have not yet had the honor to celebrate the Winter Olympics.

Our national pledge to you is: the choice of Sochi is the best choice.

But whatever decision you make Sochi’s Olympic bid has already brought its benefits.

The Olympic cluster in Sochi will be the first world class mountain sports centre in the new Russia. Let me point out that after the break-up of the Soviet Union Russia has lost all sports venues in the mountains. Would you believe it?

Even today our national teams have no mountain venues in Russia for training.

The state-of-the-art Sochi sports center is our present to all athletes – Olympians and would-be Olympians, to citizens of Russia and guests from abroad.

Sochi is going to become a new world class resort for the new Russia. And the whole world!

And we shall be happy to see you in Russia and in Sochi as our guests. Thank you.

(In French) The Olympic dream of millions of Russians awaits your decision with high hopes.",President,Vladimir Putin,http://en.kremlin.ru/events/president/transcripts/statements/24402,,DEVELOPMENT
USA,18-06-2013,Barack Obama,"
Remarks by President Obama after a bilateral meeting with President Hollande of France"," I just had an excellent conversation with President Hollande and at the end of G8.  It's very important and appropriate that the United States meet with our oldest ally, France.  And obviously, we coordinate on a whole range of international issues.  And the bilateral relationship is as strong as ever.

The topics that we covered were wide ranging.  Today, we spent some time discussing the transition in Afghanistan where there have been some important developments.  Afghan forces are now in the lead in Afghanistan, fulfilling the milestone that we agreed to at the NATO summit in Chicago.

We also discussed Qatar's announcement that an office is opening in Doha for the purposes of negotiations between Afghans, so that we have a parallel political track that matches up with the transition that's taking place militarily in Afghanistan and the elections that will be coming up next year. Both President Hollande and I agree that an Afghan-led and Afghan-owned peace process is the best way to end the violence and to ensure lasting stability in Afghanistan and the region.  And so this is an important first step towards reconciliation.  Although it's a very early step -- we anticipate there will be a lot of bumps in the road -- but the fact that the parties have an opportunity to talk and discuss Afghanistan's future I think is very important.

The one thing that we do believe is that any insurgent group, including the Taliban, is going to need to accept an Afghan constitution that renounces ties with al Qaeda, ends violence and is committed to the protection of women and minorities in the country.

And over the last several months, I've discussed this issue frequently with President Karzai and also the Emir of Qatar.  So I want to publicly commend President Karzai for taking this courageous step, and his determination to end the conflict and build a future of security and peace and prosperity for the Afghan people.  And I know that President Hollande shares my view on this.

We're going to continue to support these efforts in partnership with the Afghan government.  I want to repeat we don't anticipate this process will be easy or quick, but we must pursue in parallel with our military approach.  And we, in the meantime, remain fully committed to our military efforts to defeat al Qaeda and to support the Afghan National Security Forces.

In addition to talking about Afghanistan, we spoke about the economic and commercial ties that have been subject to the entire G8.  President Hollande I think is appropriately committed to a growth strategy that ensures we all are able to lower our unemployment rates, particularly when it comes to youth unemployment, and to build a fiscally prudent strategy for long-term economic growth.  And the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership is a strong component of a broader, comprehensive strategy that we all have to pursue with respect to growth.

In the Middle East and Syria, we very much share the view that it is important for us to build on the G8 communiqué -- to move towards a political transition inside of Syria, to build a strong opposition that can function in a post-Assad world -- and that we will continue to work to try to find a political solution to this process and, most importantly, alleviate suffering and ensure that chemical weapons are not used by anyone inside of Syria.  Both of our governments have strong evidence that in fact chemical weapons have been used in the past by the Assad regime.  But we are very comfortable with the approach taken by the G8 that allows the U.N. the full powers it needs to investigate and establish these facts on the ground. 

I congratulated President Hollande and his entire team for the effective work that they've done in Mali.  This is a situation in which France was able to stop the splintering of a nation-state by a terrorist organization, and now is in a position to reaffirm democracy and legitimacy and an effective government inside of Mali.  That involved considerable sacrifice on the part of the French people, but it's part of a broader commitment on both our parts to pursue a smart counterterrorism policy that works with partners in the region.

And, finally, I wanted to say that I welcome France's decision to support the EU designation of Hezbollah -- Lebanese Hezbollah -- as a terrorist organization.  I think that sends a powerful signal that Europe stands firmly against Hezbollah's terrorist activities and is consistent with the view that the only way that we can bring about a peaceful and prosperous Middle East is to isolate extremism and to promote those persons and institutions that are committed to a pluralistic, open and tolerant society that's based on rule of law.

And so, we are very much committed to continuing to strengthen our cooperation with the French government.  When countries like the United States and France act in concert, we can get an awful lot done.  And I very much appreciate not only the partnership, but also the friendship of President Hollande.  He extended an invitation for me to visit France, and I told him that we are always happy to visit France.

And so, we hope that we have the opportunity to schedule that perhaps some time next year.",President,Barack Obama,https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/the-press-office/2013/06/18/remarks-president-obama-after-bilateral-meeting-president-hollande-franc,,INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS
Russia,09-10-2010 00:00,Dmitry Medvedev,Speech at the plenary session of the Global Policy Forum The Modern State: Standards of Democracy and Criteria of Efficiency,"Dear colleagues, dear friends,

Before we begin our work, before I say what I want to say, I would like us to recall that democracy is a form of social organisation that is periodically subjected to tests. And in contrast to totalitarian regimes, democracy is more vulnerable. Yesterday in Vladikavkaz a terrorist act occurred. People, citizens of Russia, were killed. I ask that you honour their memory.

[Minute of silence.]

Thank you. Please sit down.

In this context I would like to say that we are absolutely determined to fight the war against terror in Russia to its end. We have no other choice, we have no other objectives; this struggle will continue and the terrorists guilty of such crimes will be destroyed.

I would like to welcome you all once again and thank you for your participation in the Global Policy Forum in Yaroslavl. These words of gratitude are not simply evidence of politeness. I believe that this forum really can affect the further development of our country and perhaps even to some extent international debate on these issues.

I believe that the forum's invitees as well as, incidentally, young public servants, will be (and already have been) witnesses to highly professional discussions on the development of democratic institutions, democratic values and the quality of public administration.

I hope that this will help young politicians as well as mature citizens to become more aware of the zeitgeist of modern life, exchange impressions about how democracy is developing in our country, the fate of democracy in the world today, and simply get to know each other's political culture.

I also think that the discussions in Yaroslavl will have a positive impact on various global political processes, facilitate the development of ideas by the broadest range of people about a just world order, the goals of international development, the transformation of government systems and international institutions to make them more rational and effective, and responses to the challenges posed in the third millennium. For all these reasons, it is important that foreign friends and colleagues participate in our activities.

I would like to separately express my gratitude to Prime Minister of the Republic of Italy Mr Silvio Berlusconi and President of the Republic of Korea Mr Lee Myung-bak. Thank you for joining our discussions despite your very busy schedules.

We are holding this event during celebrations for Yaroslavl's 1,000th birthday: it's one of Russia's oldest cities and I would like to join everyone in thanking this wonderful Russian city for the hospitality we've all received.

During our forum we'll discuss the challenges of increasing the efficiency of government institutions to strengthen global security, the state's role in modernising the economy and stimulating technological innovation, and the principles for creating universal standards of democracy based on the unique experience of many nations.

I am pleased to now join this discussion even though I actually already did so this morning. We met with our political analyst colleagues from Russia and other countries. I judge that we had an interesting conversation.

Obviously, this conversation is important for at least one other reason: not only do I believe in democracy as a form of governance, as a political regime, I also believe that the practice of democracy can save millions of people in Russia and billions throughout the world from abjection and poverty.

Recently while speaking to the diplomatic corps of the Russian Federation, I cited one of our foreign policy priorities as ensuring that the greatest possible number of countries enjoys the proper standards of democracy. The most powerful democratic governments share this interest. Mr Berlusconi who is here today remarked in one of his speeches the crucial importance of “working together to spread democracy in the world”. True, democracies can be different and have different historical roots, but their shared values are what unite us. And it is in this sense working together is what is to be done.

I think that the United Nations Millennium Declaration which reads, “We will spare no effort to promote democracy and strengthen the rule of law, as well as respect for all internationally recognized human rights” is of practical importance for all of us.

Just like human rights, standards of democracy (which in fact include human rights) should be internationally recognised. Only this can make them truly effective. Along with this, it is important that common standards not be double standards nor hollow slogans, as everyone who participates in their development must apply them too.

In these circumstances all countries could subscribe to such standards without fearing that they would be instrumentalized to impose sovereignty limitations or justify interference in another country's internal affairs. Or be used for demagogic purposes, that is to exert pressure to further the economic and geopolitical interests of some countries, and sometimes the banal prejudices and ambitions of certain leaders. This also happens.

Incidentally, similar criticisms have been made with regards to Russia. Along with fair criticisms that we regularly hear and which we accept positively, we sometimes also hear unfair and simply very biased assessments of our political system.

I want to tell you something: I know the shortcomings of our system, perhaps better than anyone else. If only because, as President, I have more information and my past work experience and education give me additional opportunity. But I categorically disagree with those who say that Russia isn’t a democracy and that authoritarian tendencies reign.

There is no doubt that Russia is a democracy. There is democracy in Russia. Yes, it is young, immature, incomplete and inexperienced, but it's a democracy nevertheless. We are still at the beginning and for this reason we have a lot of work to do. But we are free.

Today I would like to offer my view of how such criteria might apply to the modern state in the 21st century. In other words, what might the universal standards of democracy be? Naturally, I am not claiming to have uncovered the absolute truth. These are simply some personal remarks, keeping in mind that this forum obviously is a place for discussion and polemics.

I will list five criteria which I consider essential.

The first is the legal realisation of humanistic values and ideals. In other words, all our values should be enshrined in law. We must turn values into the practical force of law, one that guides the development of social relations and lays out the main goals of social development.

I consider the second standard the state's ability to provide and maintain an advanced level of technological development. Ultimately, promoting research and providing incentives for innovation produces numerous social benefits sufficient to allow citizens to achieve a decent standard of living.

Today we had a discussion about precisely this. And I think it is very important to note that poverty is one of the major threats to democracy. It is evident that poor people can not be free. Attempts to bypass democratic forms of governance in poor societies (we know countries where this has happened before and happens still) very often lead either to chaos or to dictatorship. We must promote economic development in these countries alongside political reform.

This is precisely what happened in our country during the 1990s. Just recently, during the period of mass poverty generated by the first stage of reforms, in Russia the very word 'democracy' acquired a negative meaning. In a certain sense, it simply became a swear word. Now, after several years of sustained economic growth, we have a higher standard of living. For this reason Russian democracy has become more comprehensible or, if you wish, more profitable. It proved its validity: it is no longer denied by a significant portion of our population, it is no longer alien.

To continue this history of liberty, albeit a short one, in our country we must further facilitate the improvement of our citizens' well-being and strengthen their confidence in democratic institutions. Leading American sociologist Seymour Lipset has written that the richer the country, the higher its chances of sustainable democracy.

The economic foundations of a free society rest on the increase of labour productivity, market-based economics, the introduction of innovations, as well as improvements to the quality of life and increased revenues of society and its citizens. The foundations rest on the atmosphere of novelty.

Incidentally, this always has an absolutely specific aspect: our wealth, our potential, our abilities permit us to overcome the most difficult challenges. This year's anomalous heat and weather in Russia demonstrate that only new technology can withstand the elements during such a difficult period, the new technologies professionally employed by the people, because without people it is impossible to use these technologies. And social solidarity is also very important in this respect, as well as help from friends.

I would like to thank both Mr Berlusconi and Mr Lee Myung-bak for the assistance that the Italian Republic and Republic of Korea provided Russia during this difficult time.

The modernisation of our economy and technological production is among our most important political priorities. I laid out this new course a year ago and, in principle, it received the full support of all political and social forces. No one doubts that modernisation is necessary. I have not heard any political force state that they are categorically opposed to it, that they want to preserve everything as it is. Rather, the debate concerns institutions, capabilities, forces and the pace. Of course, we all would like to see modernisation happen faster. But there are laws of social development and we are limited by our capacities. Finally, every country has its own mindset.

Incidentally, I would like to note the high level of interest our partners have shown in our desire to modernise. We are grateful for this and very much look forward to your support.

The third standard is the ability of a democratic state to protect its citizens from attacks by criminal networks. This includes terrorism I already mentioned, corruption, drug trafficking, illegal migration, and several other phenomena which threaten our way of life, our values and break our laws. Eradicating them poses a direct challenge to our democratic society. Democratic society and democratic state would not hide under the covers when difficulties arise, but will respond to these difficulties, sometimes quite decisively. Here I would quote the words of President Lee Myung-bak who said that ”human rights and freedoms must be protected at any price.“

Democracy must effectively and fully perform a wide variety of functions, including police functions. The 1999 OSCE Charter for European Security called for the establishment of a political and legal environment that allows police to perform their tasks in accordance with the principles of democracy and the rule of law. Nevertheless, the Charter links the performance of these tasks with support for a strong and independent judiciary and a humane prison system. All this is incorporated into our approach. Those who follow events in Russia will know that, as President, I deal with these issues regularly.

I think that the fourth distinctive feature of democracy is its high levels of culture, education, communication and information exchange. The more educated people are, the more cultured they are, the more freely they can judge and adopt independent positions. A free democratic society remains a society of well-trained, educated people, people with a high level of culture.

We have known other times, as have almost all other countries. Perhaps it's true that in Russia such times ended just recently. For many foreign representatives here today, such times were over quite a while ago. When I met with political analysts earlier today, I told them that in this regard our country is quite unique. We have had centuries, in fact a millenium of undemocratic development. And our democracy is only 20 years old. This is the reason for some of its problems, quite significant ones, and hence its significance for our country and the world.

The times when the 'leaders' told the so-called 'common people' how and why to live are over. It was in the 20th century, under the slogan of the 'common man', that the worst dictatorships were created. I am sure that the 21st century will be an educated, intelligent epoch – if you prefer, that of the 'complex' person who disposes of his or her abilities as they see fit, who does not need leaders, patrons or others to make decisions for him. But there must be a smart government, smart society and clever policies.

Today political and legal culture, as well as that of social interactions and civil dialogue all hold particular importance. Citizens who benefit from a range of opportunities and freedom must take on more responsibilities. Democracy is inseparable from duties – I think this is clear to any modern citizen. A democratic state which reduces the regulatory and oppressive burdens weighing on society, transfers to that very society some of the functions of maintaining order and stability.

And a low level of culture and related intolerance, irresponsibility and aggressiveness destroy democracy. The freedom of speech, freedom of assembly and organisation may only be practically effected within clearly-established legal boundaries. This is how it must be in the future.

We often talk about democratic institutions. As a lawyer I cannot but say again that democratic institutions are not simply the usual business practices of citizens, although this is also very important. Rather, they are a specific set of rules and regulations. It is precisely the strict observance of these rules and regulations that makes democracy effective. And therefore democracy is not only freedom but also self-restraint.

Thanks to unprecedented access to knowledge and communication, we are reaching a new level of democracy. I already had the chance to discuss this today. It is evident that not only indirect or representative democracy are in store for us, but also immediate or direct democracy, democracy where people will be able to instantly convey what they want and achieve concrete results.

Today public views on all major issues are garnered via open debate and informal voting. While obviously this process is not yet institutionalised, sooner or later it will be. It will guide popular will and, ultimately, it will be democracy. Direct and immediate, distinct from that of a thousand years ago, during the times of direct referenda, various popular assemblies and gatherings, but nevertheless not representative. The question is how to regulate this and how to exercise these powers.

And finally, the fifth standard of democracy is citizens' conviction that they live in a democratic state. It may be subjective, but it's nevertheless very important. After all, however we define a democracy, no matter how many times we say that we live in a democracy, including in Russia, of course the final judgment on democracy must be individual.

Liberty and justice are not just political slogans, they are also philosophical and social categories. Fundamentally, they are also human feelings. You can write these words in the constitution, in other laws, argue about them at academic conferences, but there is no democracy or there are problems with democracy if people feel limitations and injustice at a personal level. In this respect, no society or democracy is free of shortcomings and this is naturally true of Russia as well. Governments can indefinitely repeat to their citizens: ”You are free.“ But democracy begins only when citizens say to themselves: ”I am free“.

It is also clear that it is very difficult to say this, not as simple as it might seem. I have already called attention to a very troubling affliction that is widespread in our society, that of so-called paternalistic attitudes. This refers to the expectations that someone has to solve a problem for you: the government or somebody else, but not everyone on their own, and this very often hinders our development.

Surprisingly, even today in the twenty-first century many Russians still like to say that they are not free, belittled, that things ”do not depend on them“. This has different sources. Such a position can be convenient: if you cannot do anything, neither are you responsible for anything, not responsible to the country or even your family. This is a very comfortable position but it is also a dangerous one. Fortunately, a growing number of citizens in our country think differently, and rely not just on the government, but also on themselves. For that reason democracy has a future in Russia, just as it does throughout the world.

In this regard I want to cite the very accurate words of Karl Popper, who may be more important than ever for Russia today. He said that the problem of improving democratic institutions is always a challenge for individuals, not for institutions. Democratic institutions cannot improve themselves, their improvement depends on us.

That is my point of view regarding modern standards for democracy.

The question then arises as to whether Russia meets these standards. I can honestly say that it does only to a certain extent, not completely. But as I have already said, we are at the beginning of the path, and everyone in this room knows that very well.

Here in Yaroslavl we have listened to the opinions of various people, various leading political scientists and experts. It is important that discussion in such forums, where politicians, academics, businesspeople, journalists and public figures meet, help to bridge the gap between different approaches to social development and that of modern states.

Ultimately, our collective efforts must help us consolidate common standards in international law. Such consolidation is already occurring, but we need to improve this institution and rely on the binding and effective formulae of universal law to promote democracy, protect human dignity, human rights and freedoms.

Thank you.",President,Dmitry Medvedev,http://en.kremlin.ru/events/president/transcripts/statements/8887,,OTHERS
Russia,16-09-2019,Vladimir Putin,Speech at the meeting of the heads of the guarantor states of the Astana process on the settlement in Syria,"President Erdogan, President Rouhani, colleagues,

I am happy we are meeting again in this trilateral format. I think the Astana process, of which Russia, Turkey and Iran are the guarantors, is an effective mechanism for facilitating a settlement in Syria.

We will discuss key issues of settling the crisis in Syria, launching intra-Syrian political process, and helping Syrians recover their economy and their social needs.

Our joint efforts have made it possible to stabilise the situation and reduce the level of violence in Syria. The main thing is that we have managed to lay the foundation for durable and lasting political and diplomatic settlement based on the UN Security Council Resolution 2254.

The delegations from our countries have done a lot of work in addition to the regular meetings of the leaders. Thirteen meetings have already taken place in Nur-Sultan and Sochi with participation of Russia, Turkey and Iran, the Syrian sides, UN experts and observers from other interested parties, which have recently been joined by Iraq and Lebanon.

The Russia-initiated Syrian National Dialogue Congress that took place in Sochi in 2018 played a major role. A decision was made to set up a constitutional committee with a view to drafting the parameters of future statehood in Syria. Now it is necessary to promptly launch this process in Geneva, all the more so since its membership has been fully determined.

Naturally, it is essential to continue the uncompromising struggle against terrorist groups in Syria. Tensions in the only remaining de-escalation zone, Idlib, are still of the most concern. Terrorist organisations have stepped up their activities there recently.

This de-escalation zone must not remain a shelter for all kinds of extremists and must by no means become a bridgehead for armed provocations.

Colleagues, together, we need to take additional steps for the complete removal of the terrorist threat emanating from the Idlib zone.

Naturally, the situation in the northeast of Syria is a source of concern. Problems of security in this area and other parts of Syria should be resolved based exclusively on preserving its sovereignty and territorial integrity. We consider it unacceptable to divide Syria into spheres of influence.

Importantly, Russia, Iran and Turkey are helping Syrians in their post-conflict recovery, restoring the country’s economy and the social sphere and creating conditions for safe and unhindered access of the needy to humanitarian relief.

The results of these joint efforts are obvious: since July 2018 over 390,000 refugees and about 1.3 million IDPs have returned to their homes in Syria.

We hope the international community, especially the UN and its relevant agencies will be more active in joining the efforts to provide humanitarian assistance to Syria and will increase their contribution to the restoration of its war-torn infrastructure, water and electricity supplies, destroyed schools and hospitals.

Of course, such assistance must be granted to all Syrians without discrimination, politicization or any preconditions.

Colleagues, I would like to express confidence that our talks will be productive and the agreements reached will help finally settle the crisis in Syria, strengthen its sovereignty, unity and territorial integrity and make a tangible contribution to stability in the Middle East in general.

China,23-09-2019 00:00,H.E. Wang Yi,"A Joint Response to Climate Change
A Better Environment for Our Planet","Your Excellency Secretary-General Antonio Guterres,
Your Excellencies Heads of State and Government,
Ladies and Gentlemen,

China highly commends and supports the Secretary-General's initiative for convening this Summit.

Climate change is a common challenge to all countries. To jointly tackle this challenge and protect the planet we all call home will be a journey critical to the future and destiny of humankind.

As global climate governance enters a crucial stage, the international community must stick to the right approach, that is, making a joint response to climate change with unwavering commitment and unrelenting efforts. In tackling climate change, we must:

- First, be determined to win the fight. We must honor our commitments, follow through on the Paris Agreement and its implementation guidelines, and see to it that both this Summit and the COP25 produce positive outcomes that will inject fresh impetus into the post-2020 multilateral process. The withdrawal of certain parties will not shake the collective will of the international community, nor will it possibly reverse the historical trend of international cooperation.

- Second, be prepared to take sustained actions. A response to climate change does not have to be made at the expense of development. We must make sure that our climate actions are mutually reinforcing with our socio-economic endeavors, realize a transformation toward green and low-carbon development and enhance climate resilience in the process of accelerating development. We must mobilize stakeholders and resources across all sectors to scale up pre-2020 to avoid passing on the responsibilities to the post-2020 process.

- Third, be committed to cooperation. The joint fight against climate change requires us to uphold multilateralism and explore solutions within the framework of the UNFCCC and the Paris Agreement. In particular, it is important that we follow the principles of ""common but differentiated responsibilities"", equity and respective capabilities, respect the need for development and the special conditions of developing countries, and help them build preparedness. Developed countries, on their part, need to take the lead in reducing emissions and honor their commitment of mobilizing US$100 billion a year in climate finance by 2020.

Ladies and Gentlemen,

As a responsible member of the international community, China honors its words and keeps taking actions on climate change.

Guided by a philosophy of innovative, coordinated, green, open and shared development, China is pursuing high-quality growth and following a path of green, low-carbon and sustainable development. In 2018, China's CO2 emissions per unit of GDP dropped by 45.8 percent from the 2005 level, or a reduction of around 5.26 billion tons of CO2 emissions, exceeding the target set for the year; the share of non-fossil fuel in primary energy consumption reached 14.3 percent; forest stock increased by 4.56 billion cubic meters from 2005, as a result of new afforestation in China since 2000, which accounts for 25 percent of the global total; and a total of 1.25 million electric vehicles were sold in China, far more than in any other country. A national emission trading system has been introduced, and the development of a national emission trading market is well underway. Such efforts have proved helpful to controlling greenhouse gas emissions and upgrading the industrial structure.

China will faithfully fulfill our obligations under the UNFCCC and the Paris Agreement, and realize as scheduled its nationally determined contribution targets submitted to the UNFCCC secretariat.

We will continue to promote joint building of a green Belt and Road. We are implementing the Belt and Road South-South Cooperation Initiative on Climate Change, and mobilizing stronger support for international cooperation against climate change through the BRI International Green Development Coalition and other platforms.

Ladies and Gentlemen,

Nature-Based Solutions (NBS) is one of the nine action tracks of this Summit. China is honored to co-lead this track with New Zealand at the invitation of the Secretary-General. Through collaborating with many other countries and international organizations in this area, we gained fruitful results in the following aspects.

First, a deeper insight into the relations between man and nature. Human beings and nature are inseparable. We need to respect, adapt to, and protect nature. NBS advocates the harmonious co-existence between man and nature, values ecological progress, and incorporates the sustainable use of natural resources into climate policies and action frameworks, thus leveraging the role of nature to the fullest extent possible in enhancing the effectiveness of climate actions.

Second, new measures for the global fight against climate change. We have proposed over 150 initiatives in such areas as forestry, agriculture, ocean, water resources, and the systemic role of nature, and set up a Group of Friends for NBS mechanism for follow-ups to keep up the momentum of international cooperation in these areas. Our goal is to achieve nature's mitigation potential of cutting 10 to 12 gigatons of CO2 per year.

Third, fresh support for the Sustainable Development Goals. The Chinese often say that green is as precious as gold. In other words, a better environment can bring about greater productivity. We have collected over 30 best practices in forest carbon sink, bio-diversity protection, and desertification prevention and treatment to demonstrate how NBS can significantly promote coordinated economic, social and environmental development. I believe that those best practices will provide useful references for countries to better implement the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.

Ladies and Gentlemen,

Long and difficult as the journey of tackling climate change is, sustained actions will take us to the destination. No matter how the international landscape may evolve, there will be no change in China's efforts to fight climate change, its readiness to deepen climate cooperation with other countries, or its commitment to the multilateral process on climate change. I am convinced that by working together as one and in the same direction, we will build a clean and beautiful world where we enjoy shared prosperity and shared future.

Thank you.",State Councilor and Foreign Minister of the People's Republic of China,Xi Jinping,https://www.fmprc.gov.cn/mfa_eng/wjdt_665385/zyjh_665391/t1700987.shtml,,INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS
Russia,27-04-2015,Vladimir Putin,Meeting with members of the Council of Legislators,"Colleagues, good afternoon.

It gives me great pleasure to greet the Speakers of the Federal Assembly and the members of the Council of Legislators here in St Petersburg and congratulate you all on this occasion – the Day of Russian Parliamentarianism.

We all understand this commemorative date’s historical dimension and know that it embodies the road that our country’s parliamentary development followed, the road of people’s representation and its evolution over time from the people’s veche to today’s legislative branch of government.

It is symbolic that today’s meeting is taking place at the Tauride Palace. It was here within these walls, on April 27, 1906, that the Russian Empire’s first legislative body began work. All of Russian society had been eagerly awaiting this event and saw it as a national achievement and a very important step in developing Russia’s statehood.

I am sure that like your predecessors, you will use your powers entirely for our country’s benefit. I believe that continuing these historical and state traditions are the guarantee of our country’s stable and democratic development. I want to wish you success in your important work.

Colleagues, you represent the legislative branch of power and our country’s leading public and political forces. Your work reflects the people’s will and interests and gives them form in law. The effectiveness of your work is crucial for strengthening our country, achieving rising prosperity and resolving acute social problems.

The regional legislative assemblies have seen their political influence increase considerably over recent years. Today, you are responsible not only for regional laws, but also play a big part in forming the executive branch’s bodies in the regions, play an active role in appointing representatives to supervisory bodies and regional human rights commissioners, and forming other state and public institutions. Finally, your decisions determined the local government model and procedures for electing the region’s head. This large-scale and comprehensive work reflects the development of federalism in Russia.

The Council of Legislators receives a constant stream of the latest information on life in the regions and people’s concerns, including information on how laws are being implemented in practice. You see the country’s entire legislative landscape. This should certainly help you to respond to the needs of people in general and members of various professional and social groups and the business community. The Council of Legislators is a unique body. I do not think there is an exact equivalent anywhere else in the world, including in the ‘old democracies’.

As we continue developing our parliamentary system, we should draw more on our own experience and be more active in spreading the best practice from our colleagues in the country’s regions, all the more so as facilitating this kind of exchange of parliamentary experience is one of the Council of Legislators’ direct responsibilities.

Representatives of the legislative assemblies of Crimea and Sevastopol, who were elected just over six months ago, are taking part in the Council’s meeting for the first time. Colleagues, you have a unique opportunity to make use of the very latest legislative solutions and I am sure that the Federal Assembly and the regions will give you all possible help.

Just over a year has passed since Crimea and Sevastopol were reunified with Russia. Thanks to the legislators’ efforts, many much-needed laws have been passed over this brief time. The residents of these two new regions have received Russian social guarantees and regional and local government bodies were established rapidly. I want to thank once again the members of the Federal Assembly for acting quickly to resolve these large-scale and complex tasks, and I want to thank our colleagues from Crimea and Sevastopol too.

Now, we need to ensure the full integration of Crimea and Sevastopol into Russia’s legal space. This includes continued work to create the legislative base for a good business environment, creating new opportunities for attracting investment and ensuring its protection, modernising transport infrastructure, and developing tourism, agriculture and the resort sector. In general, we must establish the conditions for Crimea’s sustainable socioeconomic growth and for raising people’s living standards.

Colleagues, we will soon celebrate the Victory Day anniversary. This is truly a holiday that our entire country holds sacred. It unites and brings together our whole society and reminds us of the role our country played in the 20th century’s pivotal events and in saving the world from Nazism.

Sadly, even the most sacred things have become the focus of speculation today. This is not something new of course, and it is not the first time that we see and hear such things. This is not the first time that we have encountered a selective approach to history for the sake of political opportunism. But today, these processes have become a genuinely aggressive campaign. It is particularly worrying to see the attempts to distort the meaning of the victory in this war, turn black into white, liberators into occupiers, and Nazi collaborators into freedom fighters.

It is our task to resist actively any falsification of history. We have a common responsibility for ensuring that people know the truth about the war, honour the real heroes, and never forget what catastrophes result from ideas of national exclusivity and aspirations for world domination. Resolving this task depends in large part on politicians, parliamentarians, public figures, and on you, colleagues. We must always remember and be guided by this.

In conclusion, let me congratulate you and your colleagues once more on this day – the Day of Russian Parliamentarianism.

Thank you for your attention.

<…>

Vladimir Putin: Colleagues,

The theme you have chosen for today’s meeting is highly relevant: overcoming the crisis. The second theme, which our colleagues spoke about just now, is the upcoming anniversary of Victory in the Great Patriotic War.

Both of these subjects are exceptionally important for us. I will not speak about the historic event that is the 70th anniversary of victory. We all know how important it is and I spoke about this in my opening remarks.

As for overcoming the crisis in our economy, in order to decide what we need to do, we must first understand the causes, as the specialists say, understand the origins of the developments taking place. So, what are the causes? There are external causes of course, but the causes are above all internal in origin.

As I said during Direct Line, what was the situation we had ended up in of late? We were right from a social point of view to press ahead rapidly with raising wages and giving people higher incomes, in part because wages had for many years been quite low.

But ultimately, this led to some economic imbalances because labour productivity lagged behind wage growth, and this always creates distortions in the end.

What does this mean in practice? This is not the Direct Line now, thank goodness, but a professional meeting. What this means is that if our total GDP comes to such and such an amount and wages grow, consumption grows too, and to cover this increasing demand, we turn to imports.

 Imports increase and to cover the cost we draw on the reserves that we built up from revenues earned from sales of hydrocarbons and other raw materials. This is one cause of our problems. Now I will say a few words about the others too.

As soon as prices for hydrocarbons, oil prices, halved in value, this created problems. These problems came through above all in budget spending. With lower revenue, we have no choice but to cut budget spending. This is the crux of the matter.

Is this an inextricable situation? No, this is not the case of course, but recovery can be painful. This is the only problem. This crisis has not destroyed anything; on the contrary, it is getting us into better shape in a sense because we all need to understand that the oil and gas deficit, which over these last years reached slightly more than 10 percent, was not a good thing for our economy and we were always pumping money from that sector. This was the most serious, systemic cause.

What do we need to do to resolve this problem? We need to do what we have been talking about all this time, but which is not easy when prices for our traditional export goods are high. It is very difficult to encourage economic actors to move into a business that is less profitable than oil and gas and their derivatives, things like mineral fertilisers, which are produced using gas. It is as simple as that.

This is something we need to do on an ongoing basis, with the help of various budget allocations or through tax policy. The Government has been doing this, but it is not an easy task because if we go too far in subsidising one sector we think important, we can end up harming other sectors.

As I said, we are already pursuing such policies, but all of this takes time. The changing circumstances now force all economic actors in general to start investing in other sectors too. Ultimately, this will make our economy healthier. This is the first component of the crisis situation we are looking at.

The second component is linked to the first. When prices for our traditional exports such as oil and gas fall, this has an impact in one way or another on our currency. In this situation, the Central Bank either has to dip into our reserves to maintain the exchange rate, and play into profiteers’ hands, or it is forced to do what it did and go over to a floating exchange rate.

Yes, this weakened our national currency. But let me stress that this was the only economically justified way of balancing the situation in our economy in general. Of course, this did lead to a number of unwelcome consequences.

Above all, it made all imports more expensive, across all sectors. This inevitably has an impact on companies’ activities and ability to survive. Perhaps it does not affect their actual ability to survive, but it certainly does have an impact on their activities.

We just need to get through this period. The economy and the manufacturing sectors need to adapt to this situation, understand their possibilities, and assess their investment prospects. This takes time.

Overall, we are getting through this period and our economy is adapting to the new conditions. We see this reflected in the ruble’s exchange rate and this is not just the result of a slight rise in oil prices.

The next component is man-made, as we created it ourselves. In response to the sanctions imposed on the Russian economy, we imposed certain limitations on access for agricultural products to our markets.

It was clear from the start that this was bound to lead to a certain price rise. However, this was also a chance to clear our domestic market for national producers as we retain our membership in the WTO.

Here we need to keep a close watch over violations on the market. I urge you and your colleagues from the administrations to monitor this very closely. Unfortunately, I must state that many participants in economic activities in this area are taking advantage of the situation and inflating prices without reason.

However, this will also pass as our own production grows. We should not forget that 40 million people live in rural areas or are involved in agricultural production in one way or another – this is a third of the entire population of the Russian Federation. Therefore, in any case we are moving in the right direction.

Finally, regarding the notorious sanctions and limitations. Let’s consider what happened and what those who imposed the sanctions were counting on, deliberately or not. Look at it this way: the overall volume of foreign currency coming into our economy used to be $500 billion – actually 497, but let’s say 500. After the drop in oil prices from $100 a barrel to $50 we failed to receive $160 billion of the 500 – this is a lot.

Meanwhile, our quasi-partners limited access to refinancing on the European market for our banks. We failed to receive $160 billion and last year our companies and banks had to service their loans to their foreign partners by paying a total $130 billion, with another $60 billion due this year. Some were probably expecting to see some sort of collapse: we were $160 billion short and needed to pay up $130 billion plus $60 billion.

However, there was no collapse. The Russian economy managed to overcome these artificial berries with relative ease. True, we were $160 billion short, however our companies rather easily paid all their debts, which came to $130 billion last year, and they have already paid a significant part of the $60 billion due this year.

We have passed the payment peak. If anyone intended to orchestrate some sort of collapse, it did not work. True, such artificial limitations deal a sensitive blow both to those who did it, our partners, and have a negative impact on us, and generally there is nothing good about this – these are illegal limitations in terms of international law and from the viewpoint of the WTO.

This, naturally, limits our opportunities for active development; however, it will clearly not lead to any sort of collapse. It cannot because it is already a thing of the past. Actually what they are trying to preserve is now counterproductive for them, not for us. It does still have a negative impact on us, as I have said. However, overall we have passed the peak.

What is our task? It has not changed from what we stated in the 2020 Programme – diversifying the economy and putting an end to its unbalanced development. Once oil prices are in the $60–70 range, this will create conditions for those involved in economic activity to see profit in investing not only in oil, gas or mineral fertiliser made with the use of natural gas, but also in other branches of the economy, including the high technology sector. At the same time, there will be state support in the form of tax incentives, among other things – so we can make a new major stride in the development of our agriculture while liberating our market of the preponderance of imported produce that is often of low quality.

If we actively move in this direction, we are certain to make significant progress in enhancing our economic sovereignty and this would be a true, visible step towards the diversification of our economy and ensuring its innovative development.

The same is true of finance. It is ridiculous and mind-boggling: we do not have our own national payment system. Visa and MasterCard occupy the entire market. This does not make sense. We always proceeded from the notion that the economy is separated from politics and our partners always told us that we should not link economic and political matters.

However, whenever anything happens they try to use economic levers. In this case too. It is of course convenient for those who travel abroad to use Visa and MasterCard payment systems. But should they take up more than 90 percent of the home market? It is regrettable that we did not envisage this earlier.

There are quite a few examples of such foolish and pointless dependence. However, the problem is not that we are dependent – mutual dependence is appropriate and right in the modern world. However, it is in those sectors of the economy where we can actively develop that we need to restore our own competency. We should not and will not go for overall replacement of imports. That is not our goal.

I have said this on numerous occasions: can we grow, say, bananas? Yes, we can. However, these bananas will be worth their weight in gold. Why do it? We can buy them in Africa. However, there are things we should definitely do ourselves. Moreover, we can do it. Civil aircraft construction and shipbuilding, for example. We must continue our work in microelectronics, which is the basis of the nation’s current defence capability. And so on and so forth.

There is a very large number of areas in which we have always been highly competent. Unfortunately, we lost this competence for economic and other reasons. We can and should restore it. This is the chance we have now. If it used to be easier even for large production facilities, even in the defence industry, to buy some microchips or electronics abroad and install them even on their systems, now it is not. However, it has now become clear that we can do it ourselves.

Therefore, in all areas that have to do with national defence, we will strive to replace imported goods. We can and should restore our competence in high technology industries wherever we need to. This spells the development of the country, the development of our economy.

I would like all of us, as we understand these things, to work actively and efficiently and to make responsible decisions without fear. Leadership means not simply taking care of the day-to-day matters – which is also very important, of course, but mainly it is about setting goals and working your way towards them.

Thank you very much. I wish you success.",President,Vladimir Putin,http://en.kremlin.ru/events/president/transcripts/statements/49345,,OTHERS
Russia,07-11-2002 00:00,Vladimir Putin,Excerpts from Opening Remarks at a Meeting with the Federation Council members,"Good afternoon,

We met in about the same format at the start of the spring session. We discussed organisational issues. I think the upper house has managed to get off to a flying start and quickly form an effective team and the relevant bodies. Many of the things you have done are new, but at the same time I think you have managed to preserve certain traditions in the work of the upper house of Parliament, which I believe is very important in terms of continuity and in building on what your predecessors have achieved.

And finally, I think we are seeing a vindication of the whole rationale of making the corresponding changes in the way the house is formed. Indeed, the members of the Federation Council are becoming professionals in the full sense of the word, people who have an opportunity to concentrate on law making, which tends to improve the quality of the laws and make them more balanced. In this connection, I believe it right that you are looking to cooperate more closely with the State Duma. I am referring to the conciliation commission, which contributes to a more thoughtful approach to law making and enables you to deliver a higher quality product.

During the course of this session you have passed, I think, 77 pieces of legislation. Admittedly, the work in the main areas has not been without difficulties, arguments and clashes of opinions. But still, the job has been done. It includes land reform, the reform of pensions, the justice system, the military and taxes – all that forms the basis of the nation’s life and creates a new foundation for the functioning of Russia.

By the way, such a constructive approach prevailed in the final days of the session when key laws were approved. I am aware that they have not been passed without some arguments, but I would like to thank you for completing this work in the positive way proposed by many members of the Federation Council and the Government.

There are some other issues that I consider to be important. One of them is international politics. A good deal has been done here too. The Federation Council is playing a growing role in protecting Russia’s interests in the world. You know that this year and especially the past two months have been riddled with international events. Russia’s position in the world has strengthened. We see a real contribution to greater security and, most importantly, there has been progress in the resolution of issues connected with foreign policy and foreign trade. I would like to say that the upper house is supporting the foreign policy efforts of the Russian state in a very tangible and visible way, for which I would like to thank you.

I think the creation of the Legislative Council has been important for bringing the regional legislatures closer to the federal centre and most importantly, for providing an opportunity for regional colleagues to have a direct say in the ongoing processes of the building of the Russian state at the regional level and for the federal centre to monitor the enforcement of the law at the local level. That work is particularly important in view of the ongoing process of delimitation of powers between the federal centre, the regions and municipalities. I would like you to pay particular attention to this and to take an active part in the work.

This brings me to the end of my opening remarks. I look forward to hearing from you and I suggest that we exchange opinions on the current work and on work in the longer term.",President,Vladimir Putin,http://en.kremlin.ru/events/president/transcripts/statements/21673,,OTHERS

Remarks by the President on Education","Hello, Bulldogs!  (Applause.)  Good to see you guys.  How’s everybody doing?  You all look good.  You look good.  (Applause.)  Hey!  How’s everybody? 

Well, it is so nice to see you guys.  Everybody have a seat, though.  Have a seat.  I know you've been waiting here a while.  Good thing you all had your phones with you.  (Applause.)  As the father of two teenage daughters, I know the whole time you were just like, ""And then he said -- girl, I couldn’t believe it.""  (Laughter.) 

Anyway, it’s so good to see you.  (Applause.)  A couple of people I want to acknowledge.  First of all, I want to thank our Secretary of Education, who has done outstanding work, John King is in the house.  (Applause.)  And then, my great friend and former Education Secretary and multiple winner of the three-on-three contest, as well as at the NBA All-Star Game -- he can ball -- Arne Duncan.  (Applause.)  We’ve got your mayor, Muriel Bowser is here.  Give her a big round of applause.  (Applause.)  Your representative, Eleanor Holmes Norton.  (Applause.)  And we are so grateful not only for their service to the country, but the amazing work they’re doing with their philanthropic work and America’s Promise, Colin and Alma Powell.  (Applause.) 

So, by now you’ve settled into the new year.  Right?  Adjusted to classes.  You’re preparing for Spirit Week.  (Applause.)  Learning how to ballroom dance.  (Laughter.)  I remember having to do that.  Getting the nerve to text that cute girl or boy in your English class.  (Laughter.)  I don’t remember that; we did not have texts.  We had to send little notes.  And then we used to actually have to go up to somebody if we liked them and talk to them.  So that may happen to you someday.  (Laughter.)  Seniors are looking at colleges, taking tests, filling out all the forms.  (Applause.)  Malia just went through this, so I know how tough this is for you and for the parents. 

But as I’m winding down my presidency -- I was so impressed with Banneker the last time I was here in 2011 that I wanted to come back -- (applause) -- because you’re an example of a school that’s doing things the right way.  And I believe that if you’re going to be able to do whatever you want to do in your lives –- if you want to become a teacher, or a doctor, or start a business, or develop the next great app, or be President -- then you’ve got to have great education. 

We live in a global economy.  And when you graduate, you’re no longer going to be competing just with somebody here in D.C. for a great job.  You’re competing with somebody on the other side of the world, in China or in India, because jobs can go wherever they want because of the Internet and because of technology.  And the best jobs are going to go to the people who are the best educated -- whether in India or China, or anywhere in the world. 

So when I took office almost eight years ago, we knew that our education system was falling short when it came to preparing young people like you for that reality.  Our public schools had been the envy of the world, but the world caught up.  And we started getting outpaced when it came to math and science education.  And African American and Latino students, in part because of the legacy of discrimination, too often lagged behind our white classmates -- something called the achievement gap that, by one estimate, costs us hundreds of billions of dollars a year.  And we were behind other developed countries when it came to the number of young people who were getting a higher education.  So I said, when I first came into office, by 2020 I want us to be number one again.  I want us to be number one across the board. 

So we got to work, making real changes to improve the chances for all of our young people, from the time they're born all the way through until they got a career.  And the good news is that we’ve made real progress.  So I just wanted to talk to you about the progress we've made, because you are the reason we've made progress -- some outstanding young people all across the country.

We recently learned that America’s high school graduation rate went up to 83 percent, which is the highest on record.  That's good news.  (Applause.)  More African American and Latino students are graduating than ever before.  (Applause.)  Right here in D.C., in just five years, the graduation rate in the District of Columbia public schools went from just 53 percent to 69 percent.  (Applause.)  So D.C.'s graduation rates grew faster than any other place in the country this year -- this past year.  That's something to be really proud of.  (Applause.) 

Now, of course, here at Banneker, you graduated 100 percent of your seniors last year.  (Applause.)  One hundred percent.  It's been a while since I did math, but 100 percent is good.  (Laughter.)  You can't do better than that.  So what all these numbers mean is that more schools across D.C. and across the country are starting to catch up to what you guys are doing here, at this school.

Now, some of the changes we made were hard, and some of them were controversial.  We expected more from our teachers and our students.  But the hard work that people have put in across the country has started to pay off.

And I just want to talk to you a little bit about some of the things that we did.  It starts with our youngest learners.  High-quality early education is one of the best investments we can make, which is why we’ve added over 60,000 children to Head Start.  We called for high-quality preschool for every four-year-old in America.  And when I took office, only 38 states offered access to state-funded preschool.  Today, it’s up to 46. We're trying to get those last holdouts to do the right thing.   And, by the way, the District of Columbia leads the nation with the highest share of children -- nearly 9 out of 10 -- in high-quality preschool.  And that's a big achievement.  (Applause.)  

We launched then a competition called Race to the Top, which inspired states to set higher, better standards so that we could out-teach and out-compete other nations, and make sure that we've got high expectations for our students.  D.C. was one of the winners of this competition.  It upgraded standards, upgraded curriculum, worked to help teachers build their skills.  And that, in part, is why D.C. has done so well. 

We realized that in today’s world, when you all have a computer in your pocket in those phones, then you need to learn not just how to use a phone, you need to learn computer science.  So we’re working with private and philanthropic partners to bring high schools into the 21st century and give you a more personalized and real-world experience.  We're bringing in high-speed internet into schools and libraries, reaching 20 million more students and helping teachers with digital learning.  And coding isn’t, by the way, just for boys in Silicon Valley, so we’re investing more in getting girls and young women and young people of color and low-income students into science and engineering and technology and math.  (Applause.) 

And because we know that nothing is more important than a great teacher -- and you’ve got some great teachers here, as well as a great principal at Banneker -- (applause) -- we have focused on preparing and developing and supporting and rewarding excellent educators.  You all know how hard they work.  They stay up late grading your assignments.  That's why you got all those marks all over your papers.  They pull sometimes money out of their own pockets to make that lesson extra special.  And I promise you, the teachers here and the teachers around the country, they’re not doing it for the pay -- because teachers, unfortunately, still aren't paid as much as they should be.  They’re not doing it for the glory.  They’re doing it because they love you, and they believe in you, and they want to help you succeed. 

So teachers deserve more than just our gratitude -- they deserve our full support.  And we've got to make their lives easier, which is why we enacted a law to fix No Child Left Behind, which gives teachers more flexibility to spend more time teaching creatively than just spending all their time teaching to a test.  Give your teachers a big round of applause.  (Applause.)  They deserve it.   

So we've made real progress, but here’s the thing -- and I think all of you know this because you go to this great school

-- a high school education these days is not enough.  By 2020, two out of three job openings require some form of higher education.  Now, that doesn’t always mean a four-year college degree, but it does mean -- whether it's a four-year university, or a community college, or some sort of training program -- you’ve got to get a little bit more than just what you're getting in high school. 

It used to be that a high school job might be enough because you could go into a factory or even go into an office and just do some repetitive work, and if you were willing to work hard you could make a decent living.  But the problem is repetitive work now is done by machines.  And that's just going to be more and more true.  So in order for you to succeed in the marketplace, you’ve got to be able to think creatively; you’ve got to be able to work with a team; you’ve got to be able to work with a machine and figure out how to make it tailored for the specific requirements of your business and your job.  All those things require some more sophisticated thinking than just sitting there and just doing the same thing over and over again.  And that's why you’ve got to have more than just a high school education. 

And if you doubt that, I just want to give you some statistics.  Compared to a high school diploma, just getting a degree from a two-year school, going to a community college and getting an associate’s degree could earn you more than $300,000 over the course of your lifetime.  And a four-year degree earns you a million dollars more than if you just had a high school degree.  Think about that.  A million dollars -- that's real money.

So one of the things that we’re trying to do is to make it easier for you to access free money for college -- to figure out how you can pay for your college without having a mountain of debt.  And the key thing, as you know here at Banneker, but I want all the students around the country to do this -- and Michelle and I and others have been really emphasizing this -- is to fill out your FAFSA, the Free Application for Federal Student Aid.

How many people -- how many seniors here have already filled out their FAFSA forms?  (Applause.)  All right.  How many seniors here have not filled out their FAFSA forms?  Fess up now.  (Laughter.)  You sure?  All right, I just want to make sure now.  And, juniors, you can start getting ready now.

Because what the FAFSA does is it puts you in the running for scholarships, grants, loans, work-study jobs, all to help you pay for college.  And we've made it simpler than ever.  And it's available right now at FAFSA.gov -- FAFSA.gov. And since this is one of the most important investments of your life, next year's FAFSA is also going to direct you to something we created, called our College Scorecard. 

Now, here's what this is.  It gives you comprehensive information on every college in America.  Now, some of you who have started applying for colleges, you know about these college rankings, right?  It's like, oh, this is the best school.  And some of that information is useful; some of it not so much.  But unlike traditional rankings that focus on which school has the fanciest dorm or the nicest football stadiums, or is the most expensive or the most exclusive, what our College Scorecard does is it focuses on some of the things that really matter for your future.  Things like how many students actually graduate from the school -- because it's not enough just to enroll in college; you've got to graduate from college.  How much money do their alumni earn?  What percentage of their students can pay back their loans?  And what we’ve done is we've worked with companies like Google to put this information right at your fingertips. 

So for a decision this important, we want you to be able to comparison shop to figure out how do you get the best value for your money, just like if you were buying something on Amazon.  If you were buying a car or you're buying a phone or you're buying anything, especially if it's a pretty big purchase, you want to know ahead of time, is this legit.  And what this does is makes you think about what your options are. 

Now, you've got some great counselors here.  Obviously, you should work with them.  But not every student may be going to a school like Banneker that has as many good counselors to think about their college education.  And using this College Scorecard is going to be helpful for them to do a little comparison shopping.  Because you don't want to go to the school just because it's the closest one, and it turns out it's more expensive and doesn't do as good of a job as if you were willing to maybe travel someplace else, and it turns out that you could get the financial aid you need to go to a school that's more suited toward your needs.

So we also reformed, by the way, the student loan system.  When I came into office, you had tens of billions of dollars that were going to big banks, serving as middlemen for your student loans.  We said, well, let's cut out the banks.  Let's give the money directly to the students so they can afford college and we can make the loans cheaper, and we can expand Pell grants. 

And now, what we're trying to do is to push to make two years of community college free for every responsible student all across the country.  All across the country.  (Applause.)  And we're starting to work with colleges and universities around the country to bring down the cost of college so that at the end of four years of college you're not saddled with a whole bunch of debt -- because nobody should be priced out of a higher education.  (Applause.) 

So bottom line is:  higher graduation rates, higher college attendance rates, more money for Pell grants and work to make sure that the interest rate on student loans haven't gone up; working to expand early childhood education and preschool; continuing to watch and work with states as they try to implement reforms to make K-12 better; holding colleges more accountable for giving information so that students can make good decisions.  We've made a lot of progress.  We have made a lot of progress in terms of making sure that young people across the country get the kind of great education that you're getting here at Banneker.  And I am really proud of what we've accomplished.  I'm proud of what the District of Columbia has accomplished.

But I just want to be honest with you:  We've still got more work to do.  So as I go, I'm giving you kind of a final report card, transcript on what more we’ve got to get done.

There are still too many states that are cutting back on public education.  And part of the reason tuition is going up is because states aren’t putting as much money into state education, universities, community colleges as they used to.  That’s why, if you’re 18, by the way, you’ve got to vote to make sure that the folks who represent you actually deliver.  (Applause.)

We’ve still got too many states that have not really worked in a serious way to raise standards and improve performance.  In too many school districts, we still have schools that, despite the heroic efforts of a lot of great teachers, are not fully preparing our kids for success because they just don’t have the resources to do it or the structure to do it.  We’ve still got too many high schools where a third of their students do not earn their diplomas on time.

For too many students in America, zip code still determines how far they’ll go.  And that’s not acceptable.  Some of you probably have friends or family who are just as smart or talented or as capable as you, but they didn’t have the same support or the right opportunities or didn’t get in the right school, and so now don’t have the same shot at success.  Am I right?  Because I know that’s true in our family.  Michelle and I, we’ve got cousins and friends who we’ve known since they were shorties, little kids -- (laughter) -- and they -- we know how smart they are because they were just as smart as we were, but just the luck of the draw was they didn’t get the same chance as we did.  And that’s not right. 

So that’s why I started something called My Brother’s Keeper initiative, because what we want to do is help more young people, especially kids of color, get mentorships and the resources and the guidance they need to succeed.  And I’m going to stay involved with that even after I’m done being President.  (Applause.)  Because we all have a part to play in making sure every single child has every single opportunity to achieve his or her dreams.

That’s what Banneker is all about.  That’s what you can see in somebody like Ifunaya.  I mean, that’s an incredible young lady who’s going to succeed because she has an incredible school in addition to an incredible family.  (Applause.)  And so we’re so proud of her. 

There’s another person I want to just call out -- Amari McDuffie.  Where’s Amari?  Where’s Amari?  There she is right there, right in front.  (Applause.)  So, hey, Amari.  I’m going to talk about you for a second.  (Laughter.) 

So Amari was born with a heart and a lung condition.  And sometimes she had to miss a lot of school because of her illness.  And you know, Banneker is a pretty rigorous school, so she was worried about staying on top of her work.  But everybody in this family rallied around her and made sure she was keeping up.  Her history teacher, Mr. Goldfarb -- where’s Mr. Goldfarb?  (Applause.)  Is he here or did he cut assembly?  (Laughter.)  So Mr. Goldfarb came to visit her when Amari was in the hospital for weeks, brought a card from the whole class.  And so Amari, she was talking about the support everybody here gave her, and she said, “I believed in myself because my teachers believed in me.” 

And that’s the kind of community that we want in every school -- where you’re looking out for each other and you’re taking care of one another.  And so now Amari plans to be a doctor so she can help kids who had illnesses like hers.  And that’s what’s possible -- (applause) -- that's what's possible when we’re all committed to each other’s success; when we understand that no matter what you look like, where you come from, what faith you are, whether you’re a boy or a girl -- that you should have great opportunities to succeed.  And that requires you to put effort into it. 

Michelle and I talk a lot because we travel around the world and sometimes we forget that there are places around the world where people have so little but the kids are so hungry for an education.  And they don’t even have an actual roof over their head in some of their schools.  And so even if you’re really poor in this country, you can succeed if you want to invest in the teachers and the community, and everybody raises standards and believes in each other.  And that’s what we want all of America to believe, in every kid -- because there’s magic in each and every one of you.  And we just have to help you unleash it and nurture it and realize it. 

And, by the way, it’s because of young people like you that I leave the presidency never more optimistic than I am right now, because I’ve met so many young people around the country whose energy, and excitement, and how you treat each other, with respect.  That gives me a lot of confidence, a lot of faith for our country. 

So I know you guys are going to keep on working hard.  You’re going to keep making our communities proud.  If us adults do our part and we stay focused on making sure every school is as great as this one, and that every young person has those same opportunities, and everybody has a teacher like Mr. Goldfarb looking out for them, I’ve got no doubt that we're going to continue to build a country where everybody has the chance to make of their lives what they will.  And that’s what America is all about.

All right.  Proud of you, Bulldogs.  Thank you.  God bless you.  God bless the United States of America.  Fill out those FAFSA forms!  Thank you.  (Applause.)",President,Barack Obama,https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/the-press-office/2016/10/17/remarks-president-education,,DEVELOPMENT
China,01-07-2015 00:00,Li Keqiang,Keep Development in Focus and Create Prosperity for All,"Secretary-General Angel Gurria,
Ladies and Gentlemen,

In his warm and inspiring remarks just now, Secretary-General Gurria looked back at a journey of 20 years since China and the OECD started the policy dialogue. For China, the world's biggest developing country with 1.3 billion people, development has always been of top priority throughout the 30-odd years of reform and opening-up. At the global level, problems like poverty and diseases have to be addressed while we are promoting prosperity and progress in civilization. And that, in the final analysis, has to be done through development. In a world of deeply integrated economies, solutions to these problems lie in international cooperation.

Over the years, in light of its own national conditions and drawing on the successes of other countries, China has made tremendous efforts to explore a way to development. Thanks to reform and opening-up, China has scored remarkable achievements in economic and social development. Today, some foreign friends may ask, ""China has come such a long way. Isn't it time to stop calling China a developing country?"" As a matter of fact, China remains the biggest developing country. True, China has become the world's second largest economy. But its per capita GDP is a mere 7,589 US dollars, ranking 80th in the world. To give it some context, China's per capita GDP is 65% of the global average, 1/7 that of the United States and 1/5 that of the European Union. When it comes to overall development level, especially in terms of innovation capacity, productivity and social welfare, China lags far behind developed countries. And in some areas, China even has lower rankings than some fellow developing countries. Take the United Nations' human development index (HDI) for example, China ranks 91st. Besides, development is uneven between China's urban and rural areas and between its various regions. There are modern metropolises like Beijing and Shanghai. But when you go to the central and western part of the country, especially those far-flung villages, you will probably see poor conditions for living, transportation, education and medical service. People in some areas even have difficulty accessing drinking water. Since the start of reform and opening-up, China has reduced its poverty population by 600 million. This is indeed an impressive feat, making China the first to attain the MDG of halving extreme poverty. That said, China still has a challenge to meet in poverty alleviation. In China, 74 million people still rely on basic living allowances and 85 million are living with disabilities. By China's own standard, over 70 million people in rural areas are living in poverty, and by World Bank standard, China still has a poor population of 200 million, which is equivalent to the population of France, Germany and the United Kingdom combined. In March, the OECD issued a report All on Board: Making Inclusive Growth Happen in China. It includes some convincing figures and conclusions, which are generally in line with the estimates of Chinese scholars. To achieve modernization in a country with more than a billion people, there is no ready example to follow and no option other than to work long and hard. We are keenly aware of the challenges we face. But this does not make us any less determined to turn China into a medium developed country by the middle of the century.

Ladies and Gentlemen,

It has been seven years since the global financial crisis broke out. The economic recovery process, which has been through many twists and turns, still shows uncertainties. Recently, the OECD and some other international institutions have revised down their growth outlook for the world economy. How to stabilize the economy, create new jobs and ensure sustainable development remains the challenge for all countries. In this connection, I want to share with you the following thoughts.

First, it is important to uphold the environment for peaceful development. Peace is the number one guarantee for development, without which nothing could be accomplished. This year marks the 70th anniversary of the founding of the United Nations and the victory of the world's anti-Fascist war. Overall peace in the past 70 years has brought unprecedented development and prosperity. The outcome of the hard-won victory needs to be cherished. The purposes and principles of the UN Charter should be safeguarded, and the UN-centered post-war international order should be resolutely upheld. Deep economic globalization has bound the interests and destinies of countries closely together. But the world is by no means peaceful, and hotspot issues and local conflicts have kept cropping up. China believes that relevant parties need to find a peaceful solution through cooperation, dialogue and negotiation. The international community should respect the will of relevant countries and peoples and endeavor to foster an atmosphere for unity and reconciliation. The Chinese culture has all along valued peace and virtue and rejected the practice of bullying others or imposing one's own will on others. China was, is and will continue to be a strong advocate and facilitator of world peace and international order. China will be resolute in upholding its territorial sovereignty and core interests. China calls for the establishment of a regional cooperation mechanism to ensure that we continue to enjoy an environment of world peace and regional stability.

Second, it is important to step up structural reform. History shows that crises, more often than not, are accompanied with opportunities for change. Countries concerned have learned useful lessons from the international financial crisis. They have realized that vigorous structural reform is the surest way to getting out of the global economic downturn. On top of that, rapid spread of new technologies, like the Internet, big data and 3D printing, also adds new impetus to world economic recovery.

In my view, structural reform, first and foremost, is about stimulating people's initiative and creativity and sustaining economic growth. Indeed, everyone has a gift for imagination and creation. The Chinese say that when people are of the same mind, they could move Mount Tai. And Westerners say that two heads work better than one. Just imagine if the talent of all seven billion people on earth could be leveraged. The result would simply be miracle. It is imperative that we follow the trend of the times and have structural reforms to remove institutional and structural barriers to people's ingenuity. This could accomplish more than invigorating the market. It will also facilitate fairer distribution and inclusive growth.

In recent years, the Chinese government has strongly encouraged mass entrepreneurship and innovation. This is aimed at leveraging the wisdom of the 1.3 billion Chinese people, particularly the 900 million in the workforce, and fully tapping the potential of the over 70 million market players, especially the over 19 million enterprises. We know that big things can only be done by pooling the wisdom of people together, and I myself have seen success stories with my eyes. In May this year, I visited the 3W Cafe in Beijing's Zhongguancun area, where aspiring young men and women have been given the opportunity to turn their good ideas into good business and realize their dream of setting up their own businesses. In fact, big companies in China are doing just the same. The Haier Group, for instance, has shifted their traditional hierarchical management system and set up a new platform for entrepreneurship and innovation. Their employees have become makers who produce all kinds of fancy ideas on the platform. These ideas are later on developed by Haier itself, or in collaboration with other companies. This way, the platform for new ideas has incubated over 2,000 small and micro businesses and nurtured over 1,000 innovative products and startup projects. Over 1,300 venture investment funds have been attracted, and more than one million jobs created. The China National Nuclear Corporation, for another example, has developed the Hualong One nuclear technology through Internet-based R&D in collaboration with over 20 research institutes on 500 terminals. So we have seen what could be done when huge potential is unleashed for entrepreneurship and innovation.

To encourage mass entrepreneurship and innovation, the Chinese government has taken measures to streamline administration, delegate power, strengthen regulation and improve services. New market players are increasing in exponential terms. Each day in the past five months, some 10,000 new businesses were registered. Most of them are small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) or service providers. Together, they employ lots of people. As a result, more jobs have been created and employment for the young has grown steadily despite a moderated speed of economic growth. All this is attributable to reform and innovation. Entrepreneurship and innovation know no boundaries. China wants to increase interaction and cooperation with other countries to jointly address technological challenges, remove barriers to technology transfer and open up new sources for economic growth.

Third, it is important to carry out global cooperation on production capacity. Since the outbreak of the international financial crisis, some countries have taken a QE policy, which was necessary to forestall an economic recession. But to ensure strong growth of the world economy, it is imperative to adopt multiple measures to support the real economy. One way to do that is to carry out global cooperation on production capacity. Now nearly six billion people live in developing countries. Many of them are at the early stage of industrialization. This means a huge need for poverty reduction, infrastructure development and equipment manufacturing, which all serve to spur growth. Yet limited financial resources may have barred many of these countries from getting high-end equipment. China, for its part, has entered the middle stage of industrialization. The sheer size of China makes it the largest producer of more than 200 industrial products in the world. Chinese equipment, being at the middle-end of the global industrial chain, is competitive given their high quality and low prices. And when it comes to developed countries, they are in the advanced stage of industrialization or even a post-industrial period with a focus on re-industrialization. So they have an advantage to offer in terms of high-end equipment and technology. China's strength in equipment manufacturing could well be tapped to meet the need of developing countries for lower procurement costs and industrial upgrading. China may also work with developed countries to set up joint ventures or cooperative operations. China may buy core technologies, key parts and components and energy saving and environmentally friendly equipment from developed countries, therefore offering developing countries inexpensive, quality and energy conserving products that are more environmentally friendly. During my recent visit to Latin America, I got on-board a China-made ferry that is powered by a diesel electric system purchased from a developed country, instead of a conventional diesel engine, making it largely pollution-free.

China calls for open global cooperation on production capacity. The idea involves advanced technology and equipment from developed countries, localized production and assembly in developing countries as well as financing cooperation with international financial institutions. Such a cooperation model will provide the global market with cost effective equipment, production capacity and solid financial services. During my current visit, China and France signed an agreement on jointly exploring third-party markets. China's production capacity will be joined with advanced technology of France and other developed countries to promote infrastructure development, industrialization and poverty reduction in developing countries. This will raise the level of industrialization in developing countries, promote China's industrial upgrading and drive the export of core technologies and creative products from developed countries. The result could be win-win for all three parties. I believe this could be a new and important way for South-South and North-South cooperation. It could boost the real economy and help counter the downward pressure in global economy. In fact, both industrialization in developing countries and re-industrialization in developed countries will be advanced if we could properly combine financing cooperation with development of the real economy, and capital support with trade in investment goods.

Later this year, the United Nations will convene a development summit, a climate change conference and the Third International Conference on Financing for Development. We call on developed countries to follow through on their ODA commitment, scale up support to developing countries, especially least developed countries in Africa and elsewhere, and further cut the debts of and open up markets to developing countries. China stands ready to work with all parties to deliver a fair, inclusive and sustainable post-2015 development agenda. On climate change, China has outlined its nationally determined actions and policies before 2030, and will work with other countries towards reaching the much-anticipated new climate deal at the Paris conference.

Ladies and Gentlemen,

I know many of you are interested in China's economic prospect. Let me assure you that on the whole, the Chinese economy is steady and moving in the right direction. GDP grew by 7% in the first quarter. Major economic data of May and June such as industrial output, investment, consumption and export have stabilized and rallied, and market confidence has strengthened. Economic structural adjustment has picked up speed - the services sector now accounts for more than half of the economy, and new products, sectors and business models have emerged in great numbers. In the first five months of this year, online retail sales rose by 38.5%. In May, output of new-energy cars and industrial robots increased by 2.8 times and 1.3 times respectively. All these point to the fact that China's industrial development is upgrading and the Chinese economy is being driven by new growth drivers.

There is no denying however that China still faces downward pressure and some deep-seated problems. But these are ""growing pains"". We will strike a proper balance between steady growth and structural adjustment, continue to implement the proactive fiscal policy and prudent monetary policy, and strengthen targeted regulation on the basis of range-based regulation so as to cushion the downward pressure through deeper reform and opening-up. Our aim is to keep the economic momentum with moderated rate of growth and to raise both the quantity and quality of the Chinese economy. Given the size of the Chinese market, there is a variety of regulation tools we may resort to. We have both the confidence and the capabilities to meet the target set for this year, and we will strive to sustain medium-high rate of growth and move the Chinese economy toward medium-high level of development.

Ladies and Gentlemen,

China as a developing country has engaged the OECD in various forms of exchanges and cooperation since our policy dialogue started 20 years ago. While China has benefited a lot from the OECD's views and recommendations, China's development has offered the OECD a broader perspective in its research endeavor. Before coming here, Secretary-General Gurria and I discussed ways to deepen the OECD's cooperation with China. The two sides also signed a Medium-term Vision Statement and a joint Program of Work for 2015-2016, identifying priority areas and the roadmap for future cooperation. Here I wish to announce the formal accession of a Chinese institution to the OECD Development Center. As China will play host to the G20 summit next year, we look forward to discussing with all parties ways to advance development, and the OECD's strong support is more than welcome in this connection.

The Chinese culture emphasizes the need to match knowledge with action. Let us think and act together to come up with better ideas and more concrete actions to advance the common development and wellbeing of the entire human race.

Thank you very much.",Premier,Xi Jinping,https://www.fmprc.gov.cn/mfa_eng/wjdt_665385/zyjh_665391/t1278514.shtml,,DEVELOPMENT
China,18-12-2020 00:00,H.E. Wang Yi,"Reorient and Steer Clear of Disruptions
For a Smooth Sailing of China-U.S. Relations","The Honorable Kevin Rudd,
Friends,

Greetings to you all! I am delighted to have this virtual conversation with you, friends both old and new, as the year is coming to a close. The Asia Society has been a long-standing supporter of China-U.S. relations. As this relationship is going through a difficult time, Mr. Kevin Rudd and many friends have offered valuable insights on China-U.S. relations and spoken up as a voice of reason. We always value your input, and we look forward to further exchanges to build deeper understanding.

The outgoing 2020 has witnessed the sudden onslaught of COVID-19, a pandemic that has upended the world in almost all aspects. Countries have come to realize more than ever that global challenges require enhanced international coordination and cooperation, and that major countries in particular should lead by example. However, China-U.S. relations have spiraled down to the lowest level since the establishment of diplomatic ties 41 years ago. This is clearly not in the interests of the Chinese and American peoples, nor is it helpful when global efforts are needed to overcome the difficulties.

In retrospect, 2020 might have witnessed the greatest damage to the international order and international relations. Among many others, we see power politics jeopardizing international stability, as arbitrary interference in others' internal affairs and sanctions have become the biggest destabilizing factor to regional and global security. We see protectionism jeopardizing international trade, as backlash against globalization is gathering momentum, with more barriers impeding trade and investment, and global industrial and supply chains on the cusp of breakdown. We see unilateralism jeopardizing international cooperation, as the ""go it alone"" approach and walking away from international commitment fracture and cripple the international system, and drag on international efforts against global challenges. And we see McCarthyism jeopardizing international exchanges, as those with radical and entrenched political biases seek to label and stigmatize open and lawful political parties and institutions of other countries, and use ideology to disrupt or even sever international engagement, aiming at starting a new Cold War and forming a new Iron Curtain.

These risks and challenges facing us are unprecedented. China and the United States are two largest economies, permanent members of the UN Security Council, and the largest developing and developed country respectively. What is expected of us is to form the right perception about one another, act in line with the trend of the times, and heed the aspirations of the international community. We need to step up to our responsibilities as major countries and at the same time, work together with other countries to overcome difficulties, meet challenges and pursue development.

Friends,

I know you all follow China's diplomacy closely, the style and future direction of which has been the subject of ongoing discussions. What I would underline is that China follows an independent foreign policy of peace, and seeks to engage other countries for friendship and cooperation on the basis of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence. China is committed to bringing happiness to the Chinese people and contributing to progress of humanity, and seeks to play a constructive role for world peace and development. China has no intention to compete for hegemony. We never interfere in other's internal affairs. We don't export our system or model. Not in the least do we seek spheres of influence.

China's diplomacy is for the development of the nation. As China remains a developing country, our ultimate goal is to meet the aspiration of the Chinese people for a better life. With relentless efforts, all rural residents living under the current poverty line and all designated counties have shed off poverty this year. This means extreme poverty is eliminated for the first time in China's history of several thousand years. Proud of such an achievement, we are also sober-minded about the long journey ahead if we are to lock in the gains against poverty and bring prosperity to all the people. China's diplomacy, which starts at home, should help promote the overall development of the country and the new development paradigm.

China's diplomacy is for win-win outcome. It's not part of the Chinese culture to seek our own development or put our interests above others. Nor is it our philosophy to play the zero-sum game and be the winner that takes all. We are committed to a win-win strategy of opening up to ensure all countries will come out as winners. We believe that diplomacy as such will be more sustainable and enjoy more support. We will further open up, only broader, deeper and with higher standards, to share opportunities and benefits for win-win and greater development.

China's diplomacy is for equity. Having experienced great humiliation in history, China truly understands how important equity is. We believe that countries, irrespective of their size and strength, are all equal members of the international community. The big and strong must not bully the small and weak. We believe that countries enjoy equal rights to development. Developed countries are obligated to help developing countries increase the capacity for self-development. And developing countries should not be kept forever at the lower end of the industrial and value chains. We believe that global affairs should be handled by all countries through consultation, and that international rules should be made by all countries on an equal footing. There should be more democracy in international relations.

Friends,

China stays committed to developing a relationship based on coordination, cooperation and stability with the United States under the principle of no conflict, no confrontation, mutual respect and win-win cooperation. China has been working in good faith to that goal. Regrettably however, when we turn on TVs, read newspapers, and access new media, we would often see senior U.S. officials pointing fingers at China. There is no evidence to support their accusations. They are merely irresponsible presumption of guilt and emotional lashing out. The fundamental reason behind all this is that some U.S. politicians have strategic miscalculations about China.

First, they choose to ignore the vast common interests and room for cooperation between the two countries, and insist that China is a main threat. This is like ""misaligning the first button of the clothes"" - they get things wrong at the very beginning. The ensuing ""whole-of-government strategy"" that mobilizes all resources available to take on China is going in a wrong direction. Second, they seek to defame the Communist Party of China (CPC) out of ideological bias. The CPC, as the constitutionally recognized ruling party of China, has a close bond and a shared future with the Chinese people. An attack on the CPC is an attack on the 1.4 billion Chinese people. It is doomed to fail. Third, they hope that maximum pressure will make China give in. China was once bullied by western powers, but those days are long gone. Power politics will only get the Chinese people to be more resolved in their response. Fourth, they attempt to build an international coalition against China. But in the age of globalization, the interests of all countries are so intertwined that the overwhelming majority of them do not want to take sides, let alone being forced into confrontation with China. Facts have proved, and will continue to prove, that these attempts will lead nowhere and find no support because they deny the fruitful cooperation between China and the United States over the past 40-plus years of diplomatic engagement, write off decades of efforts by the good Chinese and Americans to grow this relationship, and dismiss the ardent hope of the international community for peaceful coexistence between China and the Untied States.

This difficult situation in China-U.S. relations is not something we want to see. The two sides should learn from the ups and downs since the establishment of diplomatic ties. In particular, it is important that the U.S. policy toward China return to objectivity and sensibility as early as possible.

I wish to stress that China's policy toward the United States is always stable and consistent. We always believe that with deeply interwoven interests between the two countries, neither can do without the other, remodel the other, or replace the other. The bilateral relationship is no zero-sum game; the success of one does not have to entail the other's failure. While China-U.S. cooperation can make great things happen for the two countries and the entire world, China-U.S. confrontation would definitely spell disaster for not only the two countries but also humanity as a whole.

Friends,

The giant vessel of China-U.S. relationship carries not only the well-being of the 1.7 billion Chinese and Americans, but also the interests of the over seven billion people of the world. The time has come to decide the future course of this giant vessel. As President Xi Jinping wrote in his congratulatory message to President-elect Joe Biden, ""It is hoped that the two sides will work together in the spirit of no conflict, no confrontation, mutual respect and win-win cooperation, focus on cooperation, manage differences, move forward China-U.S. relations in a sound and steady manner and, together with other countries and the international community, advance the noble cause of world peace and development."" This is how we see our relationship and what we expect of it.

We hope that the U.S. side will join us in rebuilding the strategic framework for the healthy and steady growth of China-U.S. relations on the basis of mutual respect, through dialogue and consultation, and by way of deepening our common interests and enhancing the support by the people.

In my video discussion last week with friends from the U.S.-China Business Council, I talked about the importance for China and the United States to restart dialogue, return bilateral relations to the right track, and rebuild mutual trust. We should expand cooperation and manage differences through dialogue. Among the four priorities laid out by President-elect Joe Biden, at least three - COVID-19 response, economic recovery and climate change - provide big space for cooperation between our two countries. The most pressing task at the moment is to jointly tackle the COVID-19 pandemic. We will continue to do what we can to support the United States as needed. The two countries could also strengthen cooperation in diagnostic and therapeutic experience, PPE production, as well as vaccine research, manufacturing and distribution. We could also leverage our respective strengths to support COVID-19 response in third countries and contribute to a global community of health for all. Climate change is another important area of cooperation. China is steadfast in following the new development philosophy and building an ecological civilization. We are committed to achieving green, low-carbon and sustainable development. To this end, we will faithfully implement the Paris Agreement on climate change to fulfill our responsibility to future generations and our obligations to the international community. At the Climate Ambition Summit on 12 December, President Xi Jinping announced China's objectives and policy measures to scale up its nationally determined contributions. We noted that President-elect Joe Biden had pledged to bring the United States back to the Paris Agreement after taking office. We welcome more active actions from the U.S. side to this end. Our two countries can come together again to facilitate international cooperation on climate change. China is also ready to work with the United States to strengthen macroeconomic dialogue and coordination and contribute to global growth and financial stability as the world's two largest economies.

That said, we never shy away from our differences. China's stance is that the two sides should manage constructively the prominent and important issues based on a right perception of each other.

First, on ideological issues, we need to respect each other's choice of system and development path. Over four decades ago, leaders of China and the United States made the handshake across the vast Pacific, because both countries recognized the importance of mutual respect and seeking common ground while putting aside differences. The goal of China-U.S. engagement is not to mold the other in one's own image, still less to defeat the other side, but to seek and expand common interests. Both Chinese and American systems are chosen by their people and deeply rooted in their respective historical and cultural traditions. If the U.S. China policy were to remodel or even subvert China, it would not be achievable. The right approach is to respect each other's political system and development path, maintain peaceful coexistence, and promote win-win cooperation.

Second, on issues concerning national sovereignty and territorial integrity, we need to commit to the international norm of non-interference in other's internal affairs. Issues relating to Taiwan, Hong Kong, Tibet and Xinjiang are China's internal affairs and involve China's core interests. None of them shall be subject to foreign interference, either under the international norms established by the UN Charter or under the three binding China-U.S. joint communiqués. There has been too much false information about Xinjiang and Tibet, and the executive branch and Congress have, on this basis, exercised long-arm jurisdiction on Chinese businesses and individuals. This seriously violates international law and defies international justice and conscience. As an independent sovereign state, China naturally has to respond. We shall not allow the law of the jungle to govern our world again. For our foreign friends who truly care about China and wish to know more about Xinjiang, Tibet and other parts of China, we are always ready to share with them the facts. We welcome you to visit the two autonomous regions at your convenience. There, you will see first-hand a Xinjiang and a Tibet that enjoy social progress, ethnic harmony, freedom of religious belief, and a vibrant economy.

Third, on trade issues, we need to replace confrontation and sanctions with dialogue and consultation. China-U.S. trade is mutually beneficial in nature. What drives trade is market demand, not imposed deals. There are no winners in trade wars, which only hurt both sides. What has happened proves that pressuring others with tariffs would only boomerang. The two sides need to remove man-made barriers and instill positive expectations for the sound development of China-U.S. economic and trade cooperation. The Chinese market will continue to grow and is expected to become the largest and most vibrant in the world. This means China can and need to buy more products with active demand in the Chinese market from the United States, and it is just a matter of time before the trade imbalance is eased. As for the U.S. concern of structural issues, China is firmly advancing supply-side structural reform according to its own pace. In the meantime, China is implementing in good faith the common understandings in the phase one trade agreement in this aspect. China has set a clear goal of building a new system of open economy of higher standards, and has moved further to reform systems and institutions. As time passes, legitimate concerns expressed by various parties will be properly resolved. We urge the U.S. side to stop overstretching the notion of national security, stop the arbitrary suppression of Chinese companies, and provide an open, fair and non-discriminatory environment for Chinese businesses and investors.

Fourth, on maritime issues, we need to strive to turn frictions into cooperation. There has been no problem with the freedom of navigation and overflight in the South China Sea. There has never been a single instance where normal navigation or overflight was impeded. China will work with countries in the region to maintain the freedom of navigation and overflight under international law. China will speed up consultations with ASEAN countries toward a Code of Conduct in the South China Sea, which will regulate behaviors on the sea and underline the principle of peaceful settlement of disputes. The conclusion of the Code of Conduct will be compatible with universally recognized international laws, and will not affect the legitimate and lawful maritime rights and interests of countries outside this region. The Chinese government is always open to communication and dialogue on maritime issues with the U.S. side. Chinese and U.S. experts and scholars may also engage in in-depth discussions on the applicability of UNCLOS and other international laws and rules to avoid misunderstanding and misjudgment. Our two countries share common interests in maintaining freedom of navigation, protecting the marine environment and harnessing marine resources. The two sides can explore possibilities of cooperation in those areas, engage in positive interactions on maritime issues, and add positive elements to China-U.S. relations.

Fifth, on people-to-people exchange, we need to remove restrictions as soon as possible. Friendship between our peoples provides the social foundation for China-U.S. relations. People with vision in both countries should jointly reject the attempts to disrupt people-to-people contact and create a cultural decoupling between the two countries, and work together to encourage and support people from all sectors to increase exchanges and mutual understanding. To view all Chinese students, experts and scholars in the United States as spy suspects actually says more about the mentality of the accusers and their lack of confidence. China has no intention to pick a fight with the United States either in diplomacy, media or other fields. It is important that people with vision in both countries jointly oppose stigmatizing people-to-people exchange and politicizing normal contact, and remove stumbling blocks to such contact and exchange.

Friends,

As long as the two countries act with a sense of responsibility to history and humanity, bear in mind the fundamental interests of the two peoples and the whole world, and stay committed to principles of mutual respect, equality, seeking common ground while shelving differences, and win-win cooperation, the giant ship of China-U.S. relations will be able to stay on the right course, maintain a strong momentum, steer clear of hidden shoals and rocks, navigate through the countercurrents and stormy waves, and achieve the goal of mutual benefit and win-win for the world.

Thank you.",State Councilor and Foreign Minister of the People's Republic of China,Xi Jinping,https://www.fmprc.gov.cn/mfa_eng/wjdt_665385/zyjh_665391/t1841380.shtml,,INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS
USA,29-01-2016,Barack Obama,"
Remarks by the President on Advancing Equal Pay"," Thank you.  Thank you, everybody.  (Applause.)  Thank you so much.  Thank you.  Everybody have a seat.  Thank you so much.  I heard you all were in the house so I wanted to stop by.  (Laughter.)  

We’ve got some important personages here, so let me just call them out.  We’ve got Senator Amy Klobuchar.  Where’s Amy?  There she is.  (Applause.)  Our outstanding Labor Secretary Tom Perez.  (Applause.)  The chair of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, Jenny Yang, is here.  (Applause.)  One of my favorites, the outstanding Billie Jean King is in the house.  (Applause.)  And of course, Lilly Ledbetter is here.  (Applause.)  Lilly has just become a dear friend to our family.  And I can tell you that she’s beloved not just by us but by all the staff that work with her.  She’s just terrific.  As she just mentioned, she was by my side when I signed my first bill into law -- the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act.  And I was looking at a picture of that wonderful event, and she looks the same.  (Laughter.)  And I don’t.  (Laughter.) 

But while we’ve got a lot to celebrate that day, we knew that our work wasn’t done.  We knew we had a lot more to do to close the pay gap between men and women, and ensure that no woman would ever face the kind of discrimination that Lilly faced on the job.

And everybody here knows the numbers, and many of you have experienced it.  Today, women account for almost half of the workforce.  But the typical woman who works full time still earns 79 cents for every dollar that the typical man does.  The gap is even wider for women of color.  The typical black working woman makes only 60 cents.  The typical Latino woman makes only 55 cents for every dollar a white man earns.  And that’s not right.  We’re talking about oftentimes folks doing the same job and being paid differently.  And it means that women are not getting the fair shot that we believe every single American deserves.

It doesn’t just offend our values.  At a time when women are increasingly the breadwinners in our households, paying them less makes it harder for families to cover the necessities like child care or health care, just to pay the bills.  It makes it harder for a family to save, harder for families to retire.  It means local businesses have customers with less money to spend.  So it’s not good for our communities.  It’s not good for our families.  It’s not good for our businesses.  What kind of example does paying women less set for our sons and daughters?

So today, we’re taking one more step in the right direction.  We are proposing to collect and report pay data by race, ethnicity, and gender from businesses with 100 employees or more.  And the goal is to help businesses that are trying to do the right thing, like the ones here today, to get a clearer picture of how they can ensure their employees are being treated equally.  A better picture of the data will also help us do a better job enforcing existing equal pay laws.  

This won’t solve every problem.  We’ve still got to get more women and girls into high-paying fields like science and technology, engineering and math.  We’ve still got to make sure that women are not penalized or held back in the workplace simply for starting a family.  Guys, we’re responsible for the family thing, too.  (Laughter.)  And they’re already doing more work than we are in getting that thing going.  They shouldn’t be penalized twice or three times.  (Laughter.)  

We still need to raise the minimum wage, guarantee sick -- (applause) -- guaranteed paid sick and family leave, fully protecting pregnant workers, finally passing the Paycheck Fairness Act to give workers more tools to fight pay discrimination.  (Applause.)  

And all of us have to make sure that all of our young girls know that we’re invested in their success.  And, by the way, I do want to emphasize there are businesses that are doing the right thing.  We’ve got a good friend of ours, Marc Benioff, CEO of Salesforce.com, which is consistently shown as one of the companies people most like to work for.  And part of the reason is, is that Marc understands that his company thrives when he is drawing from the entire pool of talent out there and making sure that everybody is having a chance to thrive and succeed at his company.  And when people see that, they’re working harder and more productive and more enthusiastic.  And ultimately, they make more money. 

So this is not an either/or proposition; this is a win-win situation proposition if we think about it in the right way.  That’s part of what Billie Jean taught us so many years ago.  I mean, those of you who are tennis fans, let’s face it, a lot of times the women’s tournaments are more interesting than men’s.  (Laughter and applause.)  And the notion that somehow we would be keeping my daughters or Marc’s daughters, or any of your daughters out of opportunity, not allowing them to thrive in every field, not letting them fully participate in every human endeavor -- that’s counterproductive.  It’s not how we’re going to build a great future for our country.

So that’s why, this May, the White House Council on Women and Girls will lead a day focused on women in America and around the world.  And we’re going to bring people from all across the country to examine the progress that we’ve made and the work that remains to give every woman and girl in this country a fair shot at success.  And we’re going to keep pushing until every single girl has the rights and the opportunities and the freedom to go as far as her dreams will take her.  

This will be a long haul.  One of the things that I am consistently reminding young people when they’re working here in the White House is that social change never happens overnight.  It is a slog.  And there are times where you just have to chip away and chip away, and then suddenly there may be some breakthroughs.  But it’s reliant on all of us to keep pushing that boulder up the hill, to just be steady and persistent, and understand that the work that we do today is ultimately going to lead to a better future tomorrow. 

And we will not see necessarily all the fruits of that labor.  The same way that Lilly described her endeavors -- when she lost that court case, she could have given up, but she didn’t.  And that spirit is what all of us have to adopt.  That’s the spirit that built America.  That’s the spirit that opened up opportunity for so many more people than a generation ago.  And that’s the spirit that I intend to keep pushing as long as I have the privilege to be in this office.

Thank you, everybody.  (Applause.)  ",President,Barack Obama,https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/the-press-office/2016/01/29/remarks-president-advancing-equal-pay,,DEVELOPMENT
USA,28-03-2020 00:00,Donald Trump,"Remarks by President Trump at Naval Station Norfolk Send-Off for USNS Comfort | Norfolk, VA","THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you very much, Mark.  And you’re doing a fantastic job, and our country appreciates it very much.

And thank you, everybody, for being here.  Today, I’m deeply honored to be at Naval Station Norfolk — the largest naval base anywhere in the world, and the home to the most powerful fleet that has ever sailed the seas.  I just passed some of the most beautiful and, frankly, the most highly lethal ships that I have ever seen in my life, and there are a lot of them.  And they’re in better shape now than they have been for many, many decades, with what we’re doing.

We’re grateful to be joined by Commander of the U.S. Fleet Forces, Admiral Christopher Grady, and Commander of the U.S. Second Fleet, Vice Admiral Woody Lewis.  Thank you both for being here.  We appreciate it very much.

As we gather today, our country is at war with an invisible enemy.  We are marshalling the full power of the American nation — economic, scientific, medical, and military — to vanquish the virus.  And we will do that.

Today, I’m here to express my profound gratitude to the dedicated service members who will soon be on the frontlines of this fight.  In a few moments, the crew of the Navy Hospital Ship USNS Comfort — which is really something — will embark for New York City, where they will join the ranks of tens of thousands of amazing doctors, nurses, and medical professionals who are battling to save American lives.

This great ship behind me is a 70,000-ton message of hope and solidarity to the incredible people of New York — a place I know very well, a place I love.  We’re here for you, we’re fighting for you, and we are with you all the way, and we always will be.  You have the unwavering support of the entire nation, the entire government, and the entire American people.

After being rushed out of maintenance with historic speed — it was supposed to be here for four weeks, and they did it in four days — the Comfort will arrive at Pier 90 in Manhattan on Monday, three weeks ahead of schedule.  Its crew will begin treating patients on Tuesday.  It will be met in New York Harbor by Governor Cuomo, who I just spoke with; he’s very excited — and they need the help.

The skilled sailors and civilian mariners aboard this ship will provide a critical surge capacity for the New York metropolitan area.  Their mission will be to care for New Yorkers who do not have the virus but who require urgent care.  In other words, they’ll be using this — people will be coming out of hospitals who don’t have the virus, and they’ll be on the ship where they have great operating rooms and great facilities.  And the places inbound, on land, will be where people that have the virus will be.  So the people with the virus will not be on ship.  The ship will be used for people having operations and other things other than that.

By serving these emergency patients away from the hospitals, beds will be opened up all over the city for those who are infected.  This ship can handle a lot of people, so it will open capacity all over the city.  And it will be ready to address any life-threatening medical emergency.  It is stocked.  It’s stocked to the brim with equipment and medicines and everything you can think of.  Importantly, by treating non-infected patients remotely on the ship, it will help to halt, very strongly, the transmission of the virus.

The Comfort’s sister ship on the West Coast, the USNS Mercy, arrived ahead of schedule, substantially, in port yesterday.  Governor Gavin Newsom was very thankful for it.  They’re working very hard in California.  It’s performing a similar mission for the people of Los Angeles and the people of California.

As the USNS Comfort gets underway, it is fully loaded with 12 operating rooms — and they are fully equipped — 1,000 hospital beds, a medical laboratory, a pharmacy, an optometry lab, digital radiology, a CAT scan, two oxygen-producing plants, and a helicopter deck, which will be used very actively.

It also bears our military’s greatest weapon of all: a crew of nearly 1,200 outstanding members of the United States Navy.  And I thank them very much.  Among the sailors departing today are some of the finest doctors, nurses, technicians, orderlies, and medical staff anywhere in the world.  These are true professionals.  And no one performs better under pressure when lives are on the line.  These are incredible people.

We will stop at nothing to protect the health of New Yorkers and the health of the people of our country in their hour of need.  I also want to remind everyone about the CDC’s latest guidance: If you are from the New York metropolitan area and you travel elsewhere, we need you to
self-quarantine for 14 days to help us contain the spread of the virus.

And I am now considering — we’ll make a decision very quickly, very shortly — a quarantine, because it’s such a hot area, of New York, New Jersey, and Connecticut.  We’ll be announcing that, one way or the other, fairly soon.  This does not apply to people such as truckers from outside the New York area who are making deliveries or simply transiting through.  It won’t affect trade in any way.

The Army Corps of Engineers and FEMA are racing to build temporary hospitals — which are now completed, by the way, in record time — four hospitals, four medical centers.  And in speaking with the governor this morning, we’re giving them an additional four large tents, which they need very badly.  And the emergency medical stations in New York are top of the line.  You have them in not only New York, but in California and Illinois.  We’ll be adding some to other states also.

I’ve empowered our nation’s governors with the resources to call up the National Guard and authorized the activation of Ready Reserves.  Two big words: Ready Reserves.  FEMA has shipped or delivered 11.6 million N95 respirators, 26 million surgical masks, 5.2 million face shields — and a lot are being  made of all of the things I just named right now; we have millions and millions of new medical items being made as we speak, and purchased — 4.3 million surgical gowns, 22 million gloves, and 8,100 ventilators.

We have moved rapidly to mobilize every instrument of American power.  This week, I invoked the Defense Production Act to compel General Motors to carry out federal contracts for ventilators.  And I think they’re going to do a great job; I have to say that.

We’re also working with the major ventilator companies in the United States — all big name companies, all companies that do ventilators, so they won’t need extra time, and they’re gearing up and they’ll be working 24 hours around the clock, and they have been; they’ve been doing a fantastic job — to accomplish a historic ramp-up, and a ramp-up in the kind of numbers that we’re talking about.

And if we make too many, that’s going to be okay, because I spoke with the Prime Minister of the UK yesterday, Boris Johnson.  He tested, as you know, positive.  And before I even was able to get a word out of him, he said — I said, “How are you doing?”  He said, “We need ventilators.”  The UK needs ventilators.  A lot of countries need ventilators badly.  It’s a tough thing to make.  It’s a very complicated and expensive piece of equipment.  I would say more so than a car.  You’re talking about expensive, complicated equipment.  So I hope we, soon, will have enough that we can help other countries with ventilators.  A lot of countries need them.

In the next 100 days, America will make or acquire three times more ventilators than we do in an entire year.  We are so geared up.  At Boeing, Ford, Honeywell, 3M, Hanes, and other great American companies, factory floors and manufacturing lines are being converted to produce the respirators, protective masks, face shields, and other vital equipment.  And those companies have been amazing.  And Boeing is giving us their cargo-moving planes.  They’re the biggest cargo movers anywhere in the world, and we’re going to be using them to ship certain types of equipment to various states.

Hundreds of millions of Americans are also making tremendous sacrifices on the home front.  In a historic drive to support our great workers and businesses, I signed into law the single-largest economic relief package in American history.  You saw that yesterday.

The $2.2 trillion — and think of that: $2.2 trillion, but it goes to $6.2 trillion, depending on what we decide.  This legislation delivers job retention loans for small businesses to help them keep workers on payroll, expanded unemployment benefits, and direct cash payments to American citizens.  And these are very substantial payments.  A family of four will be getting approximately $3,400.

This legislation also provides massive increases in funding for hospitals who need it, for Disaster Relief Fund, and critical life-saving medical supplies.  We’re spending a tremendous amount of money on medical supplies.  We’re trying to get it to the point needed directly, as opposed to our supply lines, so it can go directly to where they need it without having to go through a long process.  I don’t want to say “bureaucratic,” but we have not — this group of people has worked so incredibly hard, and the energy and the speed with which they’re delivering everything has been really admired by everybody.  Everybody is talking about it — the job they’re doing.

My administration has also taken action to dispend [sic] — and suspend federal student loan payments.  So we’re suspending — and that means suspending, in every sense of the word — student loan payments so that the students that are not able to take advantage of what’s going on, obviously — for obvious reasons — they will be — the payment suspended.

We’ve temporarily stopped federal evictions and foreclosures.  We’ve postponed Tax Day until July, which is a big thing; first time that’s happened.  And waived regulations to speed new treatments to the market.  And we have new treatments coming on rapidly.  We’re doing very well, we think, with the vaccines, and we’re doing very, very well with, hopefully, or potentially, cures.  We’re looking at a lot of different alternatives, a lot of different medicines.  That would be game changer.

The battle in which we’re now engaged has inflicted many hardships on our nation and our families — tremendous hardship on some families — and much death.  Much death.  But through it all, the world has witnessed the unyielding resolve of our incredible American people.  We are not only a country of vast resources; we’re a nation of colossal strength, towering spirit, soaring patriotism, and exceptional character.  And you’re showing it to the entire world.

At this moment, there are 151 countries throughout the world that are under attack by this horrible, invisible enemy.  One hundred and fifty-one countries.  And we’re in touch with a lot of them.  Our professionals are the best in the world.  But who would ever think 151 countries are under attack?

We are one family, bound together by love and loyalty — the eternal traits so perfectly embodied by the extraordinary men and women aboard this ship, and the men and women at this beautiful, scenic, but really tough base.  This base is something.  Thank you very much.  This base is something very, very special.

With the courage of our doctors and nurses, with the skill of our scientists and innovators, with the determination of the American people, and with the grace of God, we will win this war and we will win this war quickly with as little death as possible.

And when we achieve our victory — this victory, your victory — we will emerge stronger and more united than ever before.  We are going to be at a level of preparedness in case something like this should ever happen again — and, God willing, it won’t.  But we are prepared.  What we’ve done in building systems, we’re now the number one tester anywhere in the world, by far.  We’re testing more in one day than other countries are testing in weeks, in months.

We’ve learned a lot.  And I cannot be more thankful to the American people.  And I can say this, and I can say this from the bottom of my heart: I am very proud to be your President.

Thank you very much, and God bless you all.  Thank you.  Thank you very much.  (Applause.)",President,Donald Trump,https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefings-statements/remarks-president-trump-naval-station-norfolk-send-off-usns-comfort-norfolk-va/,,DEVELOPMENT
USA,19-09-2015,Barack Obama,"
Weekly Address: It’s Time for Congress To Pass a Responsible Budget"," Hi, everybody.  It’s hard to believe, but it was seven years ago this week that one of Wall Street’s biggest investment banks went bankrupt, triggering a meltdown on Wall Street and the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression.  And in the months that followed, millions of Americans lost their jobs, their homes, and the savings they’d worked so hard to build.

Today’s a different story.  Over the past five and a half years, our businesses have created more than 13 million new jobs.  The unemployment rate is lower than it’s been in over seven years.  Manufacturing is growing.  Housing is bouncing back.  We’ve reduced our deficits by two-thirds.  And 16 million more Americans now know the security of health insurance. 

This is your progress.  It’s because of your hard work and sacrifice that America has come back from crisis faster than almost every other advanced nation on Earth.  We remain the safest, strongest bet in the world. 

Of course, you might not know all that if you only listened to the bluster of political season, when it’s in the interest of some politicians to paint America as dark and depressing as possible.  But I don’t see it that way.  I’ve met too many Americans who prove, day in and day out, that this is a place where anything is possible.  Yes, we have a lot of work to do to rebuild a middle class that’s had the odds stacked against it now for decades.  That’s the thing about America – our work is never finished.  We always strive to be better – to perfect ourselves.  

We just have to make the right choices.  And if Republicans want to help, they can choose, right now, to pass a budget that helps us grow our economy even faster, create jobs even faster, lift people’s incomes and prospects even faster.  But they’ve only got until the end of the month to do it – or they’ll shut down our government for the second time in two years.  

Democrats are ready to sit down and negotiate with Republicans right now. But it should be over legitimate issues like how much do we invest in education, job training, and infrastructure – not unrelated ideological issues like Planned Parenthood.  We need to set our sights higher than that.  We need to reverse harmful cuts to middle-class economic priorities, close loopholes that benefit only a fortunate few at the top, and invest more in the things that help our entire economy grow. 

There’s nothing principled about the idea of another government shutdown.  There’s nothing patriotic about denying the progress you’ve worked so hard to make.  America is great right now – not because of our government, or our wealth, or our power, but because of everyone who works hard every day to move this country forward.  Now Congress needs to work as hard as you do.

Thanks, and have a great weekend. ",President,Barack Obama,https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/the-press-office/2015/09/19/weekly-address-it%E2%80%99s-time-congress-pass-responsible-budget,,DEVELOPMENT
Russia,22-09-2020,Vladimir Putin,75th session of the UN General Assembly,"Mr. President, Mr. Secretary-General, colleagues, ladies and gentlemen,

This year, the international community celebrates two, without exaggeration, historic anniversaries: the 75th anniversary of the end of the Second World War and establishment of the United Nations.

The importance of these two forever interlinked events cannot be overemphasized. In 1945, Nazism was defeated, the ideology of aggression and hatred was crushed, and the experience and spirit of alliance, as well as the awareness of the huge price that had been paid for peace and our common Victory, helped construct the post-war world order. It was built on the ultimate foundation of the UN Charter that remains the main source of international law to this day.

I am convinced that this anniversary makes it incumbent upon all of us to recall the timeless principles of inter-State communication enshrined in the UN Charter and formulated by the founding fathers of our universal Organization in the clearest and most unambiguous terms. These principles include the equality of sovereign States, non-interference with their domestic affairs, the right of peoples to determine their own future, non-use of force or the threat of force, and political settlement of disputes.

Looking back at the past decades, one can say that despite all difficulties of the Cold War period, major geopolitical shifts and all the intricacies of today's global politics, the UN has been ably fulfilling its mission of protecting peace, promoting sustainable development of the peoples and continents and providing assistance in mitigating local crises.

This enormous potential and expertise of the UN is relevant and serves as a solid basis for moving ahead. After all, just like any other international organization or regional entity, the UN should not grow stiff, but evolve in accordance with the dynamics of the 21st century and consistently adapt to the realia of the modern world that is indeed becoming more complicated, multipolar and multidimensional.

The current changes certainly have an effect on the principal UN body, the Security Council, as well as on the debate concerning the approaches to its reform. Our logic is that the Security Council should be more inclusive of the interests of all countries, as well as the diversity of their positions, base its work on the principle of the broadest possible consensus among States and, at the same time, continue to serve as the cornerstone of global governance, which cannot be achieved unless the permanent members of the Security Council retain their veto power.

Such a right pertaining to the five nuclear powers, the victors of the Second World War, remains indicative of the actual military and political balance to this day. Most importantly, it is an essential and unique instrument that helps prevent unilateral actions that may result in a direct military confrontation between major States, and provides an opportunity to seek compromise or at least avoid solutions that would be completely unacceptable to others and act within the framework of international law, rather than a vague, gray area of arbitrariness and illegitimacy.

As diplomatic practice shows, this instrument actually works, unlike the infamous pre-war League of Nations with its endless discussions, declarations without mechanisms for real action and with States and peoples in need not having the right to assistance and protection.

Forgetting the lessons of history is short-sighted and extremely irresponsible, just like the politicized attempts to arbitrarily interpret the causes, course and outcomes of the Second World War and twist the decisions of the conferences of the Allies and the Nuremberg Tribunal that are based on speculation instead of facts.

It is not just vile and offending the memory of the fighters against Nazism. It is a direct and devastating blow to the very foundation of the post-war world order, which is particularly dangerous in view of the global stability facing serious challenges, the arms control system breaking down, regional conflicts continuing unabated, and threats posed by terrorism, organized crime and drug trafficking intensifying.

We are also experiencing a whole new challenge of the coronavirus pandemic. This disease has directly affected millions of people and claimed the most important thing: the lives of hundreds of thousands of people. Quarantines, border closures, numerous serious troubles to citizens of almost all States constitute the present-day realia. It has been especially difficult for elderly people who, due to the necessary restrictions, have not been able to hug their loved ones, children and grandchildren for weeks or even months.

Experts are yet to fully assess the scale of the social and economic shock caused by the pandemic and all its long-term consequences. However, it is already evident that it will take a really, really long time to restore the global economy. Furthermore, even the proven anti-crisis measures will not always work. We will need new innovative solutions.

The only way to elaborate such solutions is to work together, which is the most important task for both the UN and G20 States, as well as other leading inter-State organizations and integration associations that are also going through tough times due to the pandemic impact and need fundamentally new horizons and scope of development.

This very idea of a qualitative integrative growth, the ”integration of integrations“, is the one behind Russia's initiative to form a Greater Eurasian Partnership involving all Asian and European countries without exception. It is purely pragmatic and increasingly relevant.

Besides, I would like to draw attention once again to Russia's proposal to create so-called ”green corridors“ free from trade wars and sanctions, primarily for essential goods, food, medicine and personal protective equipment needed to fight the pandemic.

In general, freeing the world trade from barriers, bans, restrictions and illegitimate sanctions would be of great help in revitalizing global growth and reducing unemployment. According to experts, total or partial reduction in global employment in the second quarter of this year equals to the loss of 400 million jobs, and we have to do our utmost to prevent this unemployment from growing long-term and ensure that people return to work and can support their families instead of finding themselves imprisoned by poverty with no prospects in life.

This is indeed a most acute global social problem, so the politics has a mission now to pave the way for trade, joint projects and fair competition, rather than tie the hands of business and discourage business initiative.

The pandemic has also pinpointed a series of ethical, technological and humanitarian matters. For instance, advanced digital technologies helped quickly reorganize education, trade and services, as well as set up distant learning and online courses for people of different ages. Artificial intelligence has assisted doctors in making more accurate and timely diagnoses and finding the best treatment.

However, just like any other innovation, digital technologies tend to spread uncontrollably and, just like conventional weapons, can fall into the hands of various radicals and extremists not only in the regional conflict zones, but also in quite prosperous countries, thus engendering enormous risks.

In this regard, matters related to cybersecurity and the use of advanced digital technology also deserve a most serious deliberation within the UN. It is important to hear and appreciate the concerns of people over the protection of their rights, such as the right to privacy, property and security, in the new era.

We must learn to use new technologies for the benefit of humankind, seek for a right balance between encouraging the development of artificial intelligence and justifiable restrictions to limit it, and work together towards a consensus in the field of regulation that would avert potential threats in terms of both military and technological security, as well as traditions, law, and morals of human communication.

I would like to point out that during the pandemic, doctors, volunteers and citizens of various countries have been showing us examples of mutual assistance and support, and such solidarity defies borders. Many countries have also been helping each other selflessly and open-heartedly. However, there have been cases showing the deficit of humanity and, if you will, kindness in the relations at the official inter-State level.

We believe that the UN prestige could strengthen and enhance the role of the humanitarian or human component in multilateral and bilateral relations, namely in people-to-people and youth exchanges, cultural ties, social and educational programs, as well as cooperation in sports, science, technology, environment and health protection.

As to healthcare, just like in economy, we now need to remove, as many as possible, obstacles to partner relations. Our country has been actively contributing to global and regional counter-COVID-19 efforts, providing assistance to most affected states both bilaterally and within multilateral formats.

In doing so, we first of all take into account the central coordinating role of the World Health Organization, which is part of the UN system. We believe it essential to qualitatively strengthen the WHO capability. This work has already begun, and Russia is genuinely motivated to engage in it.

Building on the scientific, industrial and clinical experience of its doctors Russia has promptly developed a range of test systems and medicines to detect and treat the coronavirus, as well as registered the world’s first vaccine, “Sputnik-V.”

I would like to reiterate that we are completely open to partner relations and willing to cooperate. In this context, we are proposing to hold an online high-level conference shortly for countries interested in cooperation in the development of anti-coronavirus vaccines.

We are ready to share experience and continue cooperating with all States and international entities, including in supplying the Russian vaccine which has proved reliable, safe, and effective, to other countries. Russia is sure that all capacities of the global pharmaceutical industry need to be employed so as to provide a free access to vaccination for the population of all states in the foreseeable future.

A dangerous virus can affect anyone. The coronavirus has struck the staff of the United Nations, its headquarters and regional structures just like everyone else. Russia is ready to provide the UN with all the necessary qualified assistance; in particular, we are offering to provide our vaccine, free of charge, for the voluntary vaccination of the staff of the UN and its offices. We have received requests from our UN colleagues in this respect, and we will respond to those.

There are other critical items on today’s agenda. The issues of both environmental protection and climate change should remain the focus of joint efforts.

The specialized multilateral UN conventions, treaties and protocols have proved fully relevant. We are calling on all states to comply with them in good faith, particularly in working to achieve the objectives of the Paris Agreement.

Dear colleagues! I would like to underline again, that Russia will make every effort to contribute to peaceful political and diplomatic resolution of regional crises and conflicts, as well as to ensuring strategic stability.

For all the disputes and differences, at times misunderstanding and even distrust on the part of some colleagues, we will consistently advance constructive, uniting initiatives, first of all in arms control and strengthening the treaty regimes existing in this area. This includes the prohibition of chemical, biological and toxin weapons.

The issue of primary importance that should and must be promptly dealt with is, of course, the extension of the Russia-US Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty, which will expire shortly, i.e. in February 2021. We are engaged in negotiations with our US partners on the matter.

We also expect that mutual restraint would be exercised with regard to deploying new missile systems. I would like to add that as early as last year, Russia declared a moratorium on deploying ground-launched medium and short-range missiles in Europe and other regions as long as the United States of America refrains from such actions. Unfortunately, we have not received any reaction to our proposal from either our US partners or their allies.

I believe that such reciprocal steps on specific issues would provide a sound basis for launching a serious, profound dialogue on the entire range of factors affecting strategic stability. It would aim at achieving comprehensive arrangements, shaping a solid foundation for the international security architecture that would build on prior experience in this field and in line with both the existing and future politico-military and technological realia.

In particular, Russia is putting forward an initiative to sign a binding agreement between all the leading space powers that would provide for the prohibition of the placement of weapons in outer space, threat or use of force against outer space objects.

We are well aware of the fact that security issues as well as other problems discussed by this jubilee UN General Assembly call for consolidated efforts on the basis of values that unite us, our shared memory of the lessons of history, and the spirit of alliance which guided the anti-Hitler coalition participants who found it possible to raise above differences and ideological preferences for the sake of Victory and peace for all nations on the Earth.

In the current challenging environment, it is important for all countries to show political will, wisdom and foresight. The permanent members of the UN Security Council – those powers that, for 75 years now, have been bearing particular responsibility for international peace and security, the preservation of the foundations of international law – should take the lead here.

Fully realizing this responsibility, Russia has suggested convening a G5 summit. It would aim at reaffirming the key principles of behavior in international affairs, elaborating ways to effectively address today’s most burning issues. It is encouraging that our partners have supported the initiative. We expect to hold such summit – in person – as soon as epidemiological situation makes it possible.

I would like to reiterate that in an interrelated, interdependent world, amid the whirlpool of international developments, we need to work together drawing on the principles and norms of international law enshrined in the UN Charter. This is the only way for us to carry out the paramount mission of our Organization and provide a decent life for the present and future generations.

I wish all the peoples of our planet peace and well-being.

Thank you. ",President,Vladimir Putin,http://en.kremlin.ru/events/president/transcripts/statements/64074,,INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS

Remarks by President Obama Before Bilateral Meeting with President Xi Jinping of China at the G20 Summit","Mr. President, I want to thank you, your government, the people of China, and the people Hangzhou for the excellent accommodations and what I am sure will be a productive G20 Summit.  Our meeting here is an opportunity to discuss the breadth and importance of the U.S.-China relationship.  As you indicated, the event that we just came from in which we deposited our ratification of the Paris Agreement is just one example of what can happen when our two countries work effectively together.

     I know that at the G20, we’re committed to working with other countries to build sustainable, inclusive economies, and create opportunities for all of our people.  In joining the Paris Agreement today, we’re demonstrating our shared commitment to climate change.  I look forward to an extensive discussion on our shared interests in advancing regional and global security, from the Korean Peninsula to the fight against ISIL.  We very much welcome China’s contributions to global development, peacekeeping, and refugee assistance.

     And because of the hard work of our teams, across every dimension -- from people-to-people ties, energy, scientific and educational exchanges -- we have seen steady progress during the course of my presidency and during the course of the multiple meetings that you and I have had.  Consistent with the notion of a new model for relations between our countries, what I think we’ve been able to achieve is practical and constructive efforts where our interests intersect and a candid discussion of those areas where we differ, and our ability to manage them in a way that does not put the bilateral relationship at risk.  And I know that we will have, once again, candid conversations about some of those differences around issues like human rights, or cyber, or maritime.  But our teams have been engaged.  They have worked very well and diligently together. 

And so I want to thank not only you, Mr. President, but also your entire government for the constructive way in which we have worked in preparation for this meeting.  And I’m absolutely committed to ensuring not only that this is a productive meeting, but that we’re also setting the stage so that the next U.S. administration comes in with a relationship that is on a strong and productive footing.

     So thank you very much. ",President,Barack Obama,https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/the-press-office/2016/09/04/remarks-president-obama-bilateral-meeting-president-xi-jinping-china-g20,,INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS
Russia,22-09-2016,Vladimir Putin,Security Council meeting,"Good afternoon, colleagues,

Today we will look at regional policy, which is a key governance issue. We will look into ways of improving it and making it more efficient, as well as removing obstacles that stand in the way of dynamic growth in the Russian regions.

The main goals and objectives in this area were identified in the Fundamental Provisions of Regional Policy in Russia approved more than 20 years ago. The implementation of that document helped consolidate our country's territorial integrity, Russia’s unity, and to streamline the relations between different levels of government and the territorial organisation.

The federal and regional targeted programmes have become more effective and to the point, which allowed us to resolve many economic, infrastructural and social problems.

I would like to note that the Gross Regional Product (GRP) also increased substantially: 25 times from 2.2 trillion in 1998 to 58.7 trillion rubles in 2014. The demographic situation has markedly improved. The population base and life expectancy have been growing since 2009. Thus, average life expectancy in Russia amounted to 64 years in 1995 and increased to 71 years in 2015. The infant mortality rate per thousand decreased from 18 in 1994 to 6.5 in 2015.

The Government created and launched mechanisms for encouraging the priority development of the Far East, Russia’s Arctic, the North Caucasus and later on Crimea and the Kaliningrad Region, which play a special role in safekeeping our national interests and security.

At the same time, the process of forming a solid system of federal relations and efficient local self-government has not yet been completed.

The risks related to the imbalance of the budget system and disproportions in territorial development and the labour market are still there. There are still many problems in education, healthcare and culture. Meanwhile, we all understand that these areas ensure the integrity of the country’s socio-economic space, not to mention that their condition, just as that of the economy, exerts a direct influence on the social wellbeing of the population.

The difference in the economic development of the regions is still tangible and the trend towards drawing the economy into the country’s central regions has not yet been overcome. This leads to disproportions in budget allocations, and, hence, to a gap in the level of incomes and social guarantees of the people living in different regions of the Russian Federation.

These indicators fluctuate even within the same federal district. The aggregate incomes of the five wealthiest regions are 43 times higher than the poorest regions. While comparing the wealthiest region to the poorest one – I would not even want to go there; it is hundreds of times higher.

Obviously, we need to specify the current regional policy priorities and tasks. With this aim in view, the Government has elaborated a draft basis for Russia’s regional development policy to 2025, which we will discuss today.

I would like to draw your attention to several important points. First, it is important to identify in the new document the economic mechanisms that will help us more fully realise the industrial, scientific and technological, educational and entrepreneurial potential of the regions, and use their competitive advantages in a flexible way, to create new growth areas and thus ensure additional revenue streams to the budget. Only such an approach will help us to reduce the socioeconomic differences between our regions, and to create proper conditions for improving the quality of life across Russia.

Secondly, we need to improve budget-to-budget relations, to achieve steady financial support for the regional and municipal authorities.

The regions and the municipalities must balance their budgets properly. It is imperative to more efficiently use fiscal tools in order to facilitate economic growth and to boost gross regional product.

In turn, at the federal level, it is necessary to improve the system of targeted subsidies and grants, and to monitor and analyse how effectively they are used by the regions. Of course, it is important to offer solutions that will enhance the independence of the regions and municipalities as they expand their taxable revenue base.

In general, budget-to-budget relations are among the key issues. We will consider it at a separate meeting with representatives of the Government and the regions.

Next, it is imperative to ensure that there is coordination between the federal and regional programmes that are designed to develop the territories. Of course, this applies to the investment plans of state-owned companies and major private companies. In other words, all the funds raised for a particular project should be concentrated in order to create synergy.

Let us discuss all of these issues.

USA,13-11-2017 00:00,Donald Trump,Remarks by President Trump at 5th U.S.-ASEAN Summit,"PRESIDENT TRUMP: President Duterte, distinguished leaders, friends and partners: I’m honored to represent the United States of America at this U.S.-ASEAN Commemorative Summit. We gather today at a time of great promise and great challenge.

I speak to you on behalf of 350 million Americans with a message of friendship and partnership. I’m here to advance peace, to promote security, and to work with you to achieve a truly free and open Indo-Pacific, where we are proud and we have sovereign nations, and we thrive, and everybody wants to prosper.

This year we mark 40 years of friendship and cooperation between the United States and this organization. It’s a long time. I also want to congratulate ASEAN on 50 years of promoting peace and prosperity and stability in Southeast Asia and in the broader Indo-Pacific region.

Rodrigo, I would like to commend you on your success as ASEAN chair at this very critical moment in time and in the association’s history — such an important event. And I want to thank you for your incredible hospitality.

And the show last night, the talent at that show — I assume mostly from the Philippines — was fantastic. Thank you. And you were fantastic, also, very much, from the Philippines. (Applause.) We couldn’t tell the difference. (Laughter.)

I send the people of the Philippines warm greetings from the people of the United States.

I also want to thank Prime Minister Najib of Malaysia for the excellent job you’ve done as coordinator, and I appreciate it very much. I really appreciate it. You have coordinated so well with us.

For five decades, this organization has brought together a vital assembly of nations to build consensus on critical issues facing the region and the world. You have created a forum for all nations with a stake in the Indo-Pacific to listen, learn, and develop solutions to common challenges through strategic dialogue.

The United States remains committed to ASEAN’s central role as a regional forum for total cooperation. This diplomatic partnership advances the security and prosperity of the American people and the people of all Indo-Pacific nations.

In recent decades, nations across the region have built strong societies, robust economies, and vibrant communities of citizens. Really proud — totally proud, always — of their heritage, and confident in who they are.

Today, we celebrate your incredible success, and we also seek economic partnerships on the basis of fairness and reciprocity. As the world knows, the United States, since our election on November 8th, has been moving ahead really brilliantly on an economic basis. We have the highest stock market we’ve ever had. We have the lowest unemployment in 17 years. The value of stocks has risen $5.5 trillion.

And companies are moving into the United States. A lot of companies are moving. They’re moving back. They want to be there. The enthusiasm levels are the highest ever recorded on the charts. So we’re very happy about that, and we think that bodes very well for your region because of the relationship that we have.

So we want our partners in the region to be strong, independent, and prosperous, in control of their own destinies, and satellites to no one. These are the principles behind our vision for a free and open Indo-Pacific.

So again, I wish you all the best of luck. It’s an honor to be here. And, Rodrigo, thank you very much for the way you treated all of us. Thank you.

USA,19-10-2013,Barack Obama,"
Weekly Address: Working Together on Behalf of the American People"," Hi everybody. This week, because Democrats and responsible Republicans came together, the government was reopened, and the threat of default was removed from our economy.

There’s been a lot of discussion lately of the politics of this shutdown. But the truth is, there were no winners in this. At a time when our economy needs more growth and more jobs, the manufactured crises of these last few weeks actually harmed jobs and growth. And it’s understandable that your frustration with what goes on in Washington has never been higher.

The way business is done in Washington has to change. Now that these clouds of crisis and uncertainty have lifted, we need to focus on what the majority of Americans sent us here to do – grow the economy, create good jobs, strengthen the middle class, lay the foundation for broad-based prosperity, and get our fiscal house in order for the long haul.

It won’t be easy. But we can make progress. Specifically, there are three places where I believe that Democrats and Republicans can work together right away.

First, we should sit down and pursue a balanced approach to a responsible budget, one that grows our economy faster and shrinks our long-term deficits further. There is no choice between growth and fiscal responsibility – we need both. So we’re making a serious mistake if a budget doesn’t focus on what you’re focused on: creating more good jobs that pay better wages. If we’re going to free up resources for the things that help us grow – education, infrastructure, research – we should cut what we don’t need, and close corporate tax loopholes that don’t help create jobs. This shouldn’t be as difficult as it has been in past years. Remember, our deficits are shrinking – not growing.

Second, we should finish the job of fixing our broken immigration system. There’s already a broad coalition across America that’s behind this effort, from business leaders to faith leaders to law enforcement. It would grow our economy. It would secure our borders. The Senate has already passed a bill with strong bipartisan support. Now the House should, too. The majority of Americans thinks this is the right thing to do. It can and should get done by the end of this year.

Third, we should pass a farm bill – one that America’s farmers and ranchers can depend on, one that protects vulnerable children and adults in times of need, and one that gives rural communities opportunities to grow and the longer-term certainty they deserve.

We won’t suddenly agree on everything now that the cloud of crisis has passed. But we shouldn’t hold back on places where we do agree, just because we don’t think it’s good politics, or just because the extremes in our parties don’t like compromise. I’ll look for willing partners from either party to get important work done. There’s no good reason why we can’t govern responsibly, without lurching from manufactured crisis to manufactured crisis. Because that isn’t governing – it’s just hurting the people we were sent here to serve.

Those of us who have the privilege to serve this country have an obligation to do our job the best we can. We come from different parties, but we’re Americans first. And our obligations to you must compel all of us, Democrats and Republicans, to cooperate, and compromise, and act in the best interests of this country we love.

Thanks everybody, and have a great weekend.",President,Barack Obama,https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/the-press-office/2013/10/19/weekly-address-working-together-behalf-american-people,,DEVELOPMENT
China,13-11-2014 00:00,Li Keqiang,Remarks by H.E. Li Keqiang Premier of the State Council of the People's Republic of China At the 17th ASEAN-China Summit,"President Thein Sein,
Dear Colleagues,

It gives me great pleasure to join you in the beautiful city of Nay Pyi Taw for this summit between China and ASEAN. I wish to thank President Thein Sein and the government of Myanmar for making great preparations and arrangements for this meeting. I look forward to a thorough and productive discussion with you to build more consensus for greater China-ASEAN cooperation.

Last year, we celebrated the 10th anniversary of the China-ASEAN strategic partnership. In recent years, the friendly and cooperative relations between us have witnessed sustained and steady growth and become a flagship of East Asia cooperation. While reviewing our achievements, we have taken a longer view and come up with such major initiatives as to build the China-ASEAN community of shared destiny and the 21st Century Maritime Silk Road. We have also decided to implement the ""2+7 cooperation framework"", which refers to the two-point political consensus on promoting political and security cooperation and economic development in parallel, and the seven priority areas that include the political field, business, connectivity, finance, maritime cooperation, security and the people-to-people, scientific and environmental field. This has charted the course of our relations in the years to come.

Over the past year, relations between China and ASEAN have made big headway. Despite sluggish global economic recovery, two-way trade in the first three quarters of this year reached US$346.6 billion, up 7.5% year on year. We agreed to launch negotiations on an upgraded FTA and the first round of talks was held. Together we put in place an Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB), and China and all ten ASEAN countries will become AIIB's founding members. We worked hard to advance people-to-people exchanges and staged spectacular events for the China-ASEAN Cultural Exchange Year. We also launched the Network of ASEAN-China Think-Tanks. Such progress has been made thanks to the strong dynamism of China-ASEAN cooperation, and will herald an even brighter future for China-ASEAN relations.

The international situation remains complex and our world is confronted with many economic, political and security challenges. Nonetheless, East Asia has on the whole remained stable and continued to move forward. This would not have been possible without countries in this region working together for peace and stability and focusing on economic growth and people's well-being. China and ASEAN have both contributed significantly to East Asia's development. China is firmly committed to peace and development in Asia, to a path of peaceful development and to a diplomacy aimed at achieving good neighborliness. China stands ready to benefit its neighborhood and Asia at large with its own development and to live in lasting peace and shared prosperity with all its East Asian neighbors.

As close neighbors, China and ASEAN countries have extensive common interests. In the meantime, we also have some different concerns and disagreements, which is just natural between neighbors. Though there exist disputes between China and some ASEAN countries regarding the South China Sea, this does not affect overall stability in the South China Sea, and freedom and safety of navigation in the South China Sea is guaranteed. Since the start of this year, our two sides have conducted effective communication and dialogue on the South China Sea issue and reached important and extensive common ground. We put forward a ""dual-track"" approach, making it clear that specific disputes are to be addressed by countries directly concerned peacefully through negotiation and consultation based on historical facts, international law and the DOC and that peace and security of the South China Sea be jointly upheld by China and ASEAN countries working together. We stressed the need to actively advance practical maritime cooperation and accelerate the establishment of cooperation mechanisms in such areas as joint maritime search and rescue, scientific research, environmental protection and crackdown on transnational crimes. We agreed to engage actively in consultations and, on the basis of consensus-building, conclude a code of conduct (COC) at an early date. China stands ready to work with ASEAN countries to promote full and effective implementation of the DOC and consultation on a COC, so as to effectively boost communication and mutual trust, expand consensus and cooperation and turn the South China Sea into a ""sea of peace, friendship and cooperation"" for the benefit of people of all countries in the region.

Dear Colleagues,

The China-ASEAN strategic partnership has entered a new historical era, presenting the two sides with rare opportunities for cooperation across the board. The Chinese government takes ASEAN as a priority in its neighborhood diplomacy and firmly supports the building of the ASEAN Political-Security Community, Economic Community and Socio-Cultural Community as well as ASEAN centrality in East Asia cooperation. China will work with ASEAN countries to expand practical cooperation in all areas, continue to deepen the integration of interests of the two sides on the basis of the 2+7 framework and build a closer community of shared destiny between China and ASEAN with a view to taking our relations to a new height. To this end, I wish to make the following proposals:

First, we need to work closely to develop a grand strategy for the growth of China-ASEAN relations. To guide the future growth of our relations, we should start formulating as early as possible the third plan of action (2016-2020) of the China-ASEAN Joint Declaration on Strategic Partnership for Peace and Prosperity. China is willing to offer ASEAN countries US$10 billion of concessional loans to boost practical cooperation in various fields between the two sides. On top of our commitment last year, we will provide ASEAN with another RMB50 million of assistance gratis to support ASEAN community building. Stronger bilateral cooperation between China and ASEAN countries will also be conducive to ASEAN community building. China is willing to negotiate and conclude with ASEAN a treaty of good-neighborliness, friendship and cooperation between China and ASEAN countries. In this regard, we suggest the two sides continue to make good use of mechanisms such as senior officials' meetings and establish a working group. To promote subregional development in ASEAN, China will respond positively to the initiative of Thailand and will explore the establishment of a Lancang-Mekong River dialogue and cooperation mechanism under the ASEAN Plus China framework. We plan to hold a foreign ministers' meeting and a meeting of senior foreign affairs officials on this matter at an appropriate time next year. China will take an active part in East Asia cooperation on poverty reduction. Next year, China will offer less-developed ASEAN countries RMB3 billion of assistance gratis to support efforts at narrowing the development gap within ASEAN.

Second, we need to work together to build an upgraded China-ASEAN Free Trade Area. An improved China-ASEAN FTA will not only boost economic and trade cooperation between the two sides, but also lay the groundwork for the RCEP (Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership). Under the principle of mutual benefit, China will work with ASEAN countries to advance negotiations on the upgraded version of the FTA and hopefully to conclude the negotiations before the end of 2015. China will, with a more open attitude, explore with ASEAN a model of pre-establishment national treatment plus a negative list in negotiating an investment treaty. In the coming three years, China will set aside RMB30 million in support of economic and technical cooperation under the FTA framework. China is also willing to work with ASEAN countries to build trans-border economic cooperation zones and industrial parks. The two sides may strengthen research and cooperation in such areas as harmonization of FTA rules and standards, industrial integration and SMEs cooperation.

Third, we need to speed up the building of the basic connectivity network. A connectivity network is the prerequisite for the free flow of trade and investment. We should continue to coordinate air, land and maritime transportation routes, and strengthen the planning and building of connectivity in the areas of telecommunications, power, and cyberspace. We should focus on improving the soft environment such as customs clearance facilitation, market regulation and standard and norm setting. The two sides may continue to jointly promote the early operation of the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank to provide financial support to infrastructure development in the region. China has announced the establishment of the Silk Road Fund to support connectivity development on a priority basis. China will start fund-raising for the second phase of the China-ASEAN Investment Cooperation Fund totaling US$3 billion. The China Development Bank will also set up a US$10 billion special loan on China-ASEAN infrastructure development. After years of development, China now has a strong capacity in infrastructure development and Chinese equipment is of high quality. We encourage competitive Chinese producers of iron and steel, cement and plate glass, etc. to shift their operation to ASEAN countries to meet the local need of infrastructure development through investment, leasing and loan lending so as to achieve mutual benefit.

Fourth, we need to foster new highlights in maritime cooperation. China proposes the building of a 21st Century Maritime Silk Road, which will facilitate China-ASEAN maritime cooperation. China proposes next year be designated as the year of China-ASEAN maritime cooperation. The two sides may discuss the holding of such events as a maritime cooperation forum attended by maritime ministers of relevant countries, more dialogue and cooperation between the maritime law-enforcement bodies and the establishment of a maritime cooperation center. China welcomes and appreciates the finalization of the Pan-Beibu Gulf Economic Cooperation Action Roadmap with the support of the Asian Development Bank, and is willing to continue the practical cooperation with all parties. China will work with ASEAN countries to implement well the projects sponsored by the China-ASEAN Maritime Cooperation Fund in 2014. And we welcome ASEAN countries to actively apply for projects for 2015.

Fifth, we need to ensure ""double security"" in traditional and nontraditional areas. To enhance our strategic trust, China welcomes ASEAN defense ministers to attend the Informal ASEAN-China Defense Ministers' Meeting in China next year. The two sides may discuss the establishment of a China-ASEAN defense hotline and hold joint exercises. We should continue to promote cooperation in nontraditional security areas. We welcome the signing of the MOU on Arrangements for Disaster Management Cooperation between the two sides. China has already provided RMB50 million of disaster relief assistance. We look for an early determination of cooperation projects and their proper implementation.

Sixth, we need to actively explore new areas of cooperation in people-to-people exchanges, science and technology and environmental protection. People-to-people exchange facilitates cooperation, and cooperation among the peoples will strengthen the basis of state-to-state relations. China is ready to work with ASEAN countries to develop an action plan for our cultural cooperation and support Myanmar's efforts for a successful closing ceremony of the China-ASEAN Cultural Exchange Year. We will establish the second batch of the China-ASEAN Education and Training Centers and redouble our efforts to ensure the success of the China-ASEAN Education Cooperation Week. China will set up new agricultural technology demonstration centers in ASEAN countries and carry out cooperation on rural poverty reduction and training programs for one hundred public health professionals. We are willing to work with ASEAN countries to promote implementation of the ""Science and Technology Partnership Program"" and support 100 young scientists from ASEAN countries to conduct short-term research in China in the next three years. China proposes the launch of the formulation of the China-ASEAN Strategy on Environmental Protection Cooperation (2016-2020) and the sharing of fruits of scientific innovation and ecological development to improve the well-being of people in the region, accelerate poverty reduction and benefit people on both sides.

Dear Colleagues,

The China-ASEAN Strategic Partnership, having experienced a ""Golden Decade"" of development, now stands at an even higher starting point for a Diamond Decade leading to broader and deeper cooperation. The Chinese people believe that an opportune time, a favorable geographic position and a harmonious relationship are the three important conditions for any big accomplishment to be made. China-ASEAN cooperation has entered the fast track and embraced sound opportunities for fast development. This represents ""the opportune time"". Geographic proximity has facilitated people-to-people exchanges and trade links between countries in East Asia. This represents ""the favorable geographic position"". In addition, countries in East Asia enjoy cultural affinity and close people-to-people connections. This represents ""the harmonious relationship"". Our shared interests and the affinity of our cultural tradition far outweigh our different views and disagreements. China is ready to increase common interests with ASEAN and seize the opportunity so that the development of China-ASEAN relations will bring more benefits to our people and that the all-dimensional cooperation between China and ASEAN will stand out as a shining example of overall peace, development and cooperation in East Asia and the world at large.

Thank you very much. ",Premier,Xi Jinping,https://www.fmprc.gov.cn/mfa_eng/wjdt_665385/zyjh_665391/t1212266.shtml,,INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS
Russia,21-11-2006,Vladimir Putin,Address to the National Coordination Meeting of Law Enforcement Agency Directors,"Dear colleagues,

Today’s coordination meeting is about making the Russian law enforcement system more effective.

Present here today, aside from the law enforcement agency directors, are representatives of the legislative and executive authorities and regional leaders. You are here to make practical and effective decisions on strengthening law and order in the country.

As you know, financing for the law enforcement agencies has seen a many-fold increase over recent years. The number of personnel has increased, there is greater coordination today between the law enforcement and special agencies and their structure has been optimised. Major federal programmes such as Anti-Terror, State Border, Developing the State Corrections System over the period 2007–2016 and others have been adopted and are being implemented.

At the same time, despite the law enforcement agencies’ increasing potential, the crime situation remains complex. The number of serious and very serious crimes is on the rise. Street crime has increased by more than a third.

Overall, the number of crimes registered since the beginning of this year has risen by 12.5 percent compared to the same period of 2005. Only half of these crimes are actually solved. This continues to have a negative impact on the situation in society and obstructs the development of business life in the country.

This situation clearly calls for more efficient comprehensive measures and steps aimed primarily at crime prevention. One such step would be, for example, to create a unified state crime prevention system that would involve all the bodies of state power, from the national government down to the local authorities. Of course, civil society organisations could also play an invaluable part in such a system.

As far as crime prevention is concerned, we need to focus particularly on teenage and juvenile crime. Minors are particularly easy prey for drug dealers and are easily caught up in extremist networks. Many crimes are committed by homeless children and children whose parents are not looking after them. Our country still has not put in place a unified system for keeping track of these children.

I want to stress that if we do not turn this situation around, we will end up in a few years with an entire generation of citizens who have no social bearings and take a nihilistic approach to the law. What we need is a genuinely effective national public programme for working with these children who find themselves in difficult circumstances. This programme should clearly define the practical and concrete steps that state and public agencies should take and, most importantly, ensure strict supervision to make sure that the measures set out are actually implemented.

Dear colleagues,

A good legal base is one of the most important conditions in successfully fighting crime. During the first years of its application, problems were revealed with the new Criminal Procedural Code, especially with regards to preliminary investigations of criminal cases. Today, the investigation of even minor cases requires complex procedural operations and volumes of documentation.

It is clear that the law enforcement agencies’ investigation departments should concentrate on investigating the most serious cases, while less serious cases can be investigated at a quicker pace through inquest. Work on improving the Criminal Procedural Code should move in this direction today, taking into account the reality of the current situation.

The introduction of jury trials, a new institution within our judicial system, has also brought with it new problems. But I think that many of these problems are linked to the poor quality of preliminary investigation and state prosecution. We need to draw the relevant conclusions and take swift action to improve the situation.

Continued development of the law enforcement system itself is another key task, and one that requires clear criteria for measuring the results of each of the law enforcement agencies’ work.

These criteria should take into account above all concrete results and the actual quality of law enforcement officers’ work. Growing public trust in the law enforcement agencies should be one of the main indicators. That is not to mention obvious criteria such as reducing inefficient spending and using the savings made to increase the remuneration of law enforcement personnel, and work to increase the quality of law enforcement personnel. I will issue instructions on drafting the relevant regulations in order to achieve these objectives.

Combating economic crime is another of today’s priorities.

As the economy grows, legal guarantees for fair competition, protection of property rights and free enterprise are increasingly important. But at the same time, illegal business practices, fictitious bankruptcies and takeovers of companies are becoming increasingly aggressive.

That’s not to mention the ever more sophisticated money laundering schemes used to launder the proceeds of crime. This includes imitating an increase to charter capital and carrying out illegal share issues, including through electronic transactions and bank transfers through transit countries with opaque banking systems.

These types of crime are new in many ways for us and they deal a serious blow to the legal economy, undermining the trust of both domestic and foreign investors. Moreover, this ‘shadow’ business sometimes becomes a source of funding for terrorist and extremist groups, and you who are present here today are aware of this fact.

These revenues are fertile soil for the spread of corruption. I would like to say a few words in particular on the subject of corruption. Despite the many state anti-corruption programmes that have been implemented, the public still awaits more effective results in combating this evil. The professionalism of the police, prosecutor’s office and the other law enforcement agencies is not enough on its own to win this fight.

We have adhered to the Criminal Law Convention on Corruption, the UN Convention against Corruption and the UN Convention against Trans-National Organised Crime. But we still have not passed the statutes and regulations that would enable us to implement their provisions.

One of the main thrusts of efforts to stamp out corruption should be the passing of laws that would prevent officials and state and municipal civil servants from entering into corrupt deals. In this respect, one of the steps that we need to take today is to subject new laws to expertise by criminology experts, including to examine how effective they are likely to be in preventing corruption. This is one of the provisions of the UN Convention against Corruption.

I note once again how important it is to improve the legal foundation for fighting corruption. This is not just a case of toughening the penalties contained in the relevant criminal law provisions. Our legislation in general should ensure that there is no soil in which corruption can flourish in the administrative procedures of the state administration system.

The fight against corruption in the law enforcement and judicial systems must become more effective. We need to implement in full the measures set out in the federal programme Developing Russia’s Judicial System over the period 2007–2011. Above all, this means ensuring the independence, openness and transparency of judges’ work at every level and giving the public greater access to the judicial system.

Furthermore, it is time to set in law the demands and restrictions on law enforcement and judicial system personnel, in particular controls on the revenue and property of law enforcement personnel, judges and members of their families. These measures have already been approved here and abroad and are among the provisions set out in the General Standards for Combating Corruption in Police Forces and Services, adopted in 2002 by the Interpol General Assembly.

Finally, it is equally important to provide legal protection to law enforcement personnel and judges against unlawful intervention in their work by all sorts of people with their own interests and by officials at various levels.

Now I would like to say a few words about the immigration situation.

As you know, new labour migration quotas will take effect throughout Russia in 2007. At the same time, we are raising the liability for employers who use unregistered workers. We are also toughening the penalties for immigrants unlawfully working in Russia. It is the job of the law enforcement agencies and the Federal Migration Service to ensure strict compliance with the current rules and the new rules introduced next year.

In conclusion, I would like to note that resolving all of these tasks depends directly also on the law enforcement agencies’ professionalism and on strengthening enforcement discipline within them. It is no exaggeration to say that this is also a key condition for reducing the crime rate.

I hope that you will take every step necessary to strengthen law and order in Russia.

Thank you for your attention and I wish you success in your work. ",President,Vladimir Putin,http://en.kremlin.ru/events/president/transcripts/statements/23915,,OTHERS
USA,20-12-2019 00:00,Donald Trump,"Remarks by President Trump at Signing Ceremony for S.1790, National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2020","THE PRESIDENT:  Well, thank you very much.  And, thank you, Melania.  And hello, Joint Base Andrews — special place.  At ease.  We have good news for you.

On behalf of the First Lady, Vice President Mike Pence, Mrs. Pence, I want to wish everybody a very merry Christmas, happy New Year.

This is a truly historic day for the American Armed Forces. In just a few minutes, I will proudly sign into law the largest-ever investment in the United States military.  In fact, I can say: the largest ever, by far.

Today also marks another landmark achievement, as we officially inaugurate the newest branch of our military.  This is a very big and important moment.  It’s called the Space Force.  (Applause.)

Most importantly, we are supporting you — the heroes who defend our families, secure our nation, and protect our freedom.
The 2020 National Defense Authorization Act is about making sure our warfighters have the tools, resources, and equipment you need to fight and to win — all the time, to win.  We’re making our military stronger and more powerful than ever before.

We’re joined today by Secretary of Defense Mark Esper, and our service Secretaries.  General Mark Milley — thank you very much, General.  Fantastic job you’re doing.  And members of the Joint Chiefs of Staff; many distinguished military leaders; and Representatives Mac Thornberry, Joe Wilson, Mike Rogers, Michael Turner, Michael McCaul, Robert Wittman, French Hill, Matt Gaetz, Greg Pence, and Michael Waltz.  And I want to give a special shout out to a very great gentleman who loves the military, loves this country: Senator Jim Inhofe.  He’s worked so hard on this.  (Applause.)  Thank you, Jim.  Thank you all.

I want to extend a special thanks to Commander of the Air Force District of Washington, Major General Ricky Rupp — (applause) — and Commander of the 11th Wing and Joint Base Andrews, Colonel Andrew Purath.  Thank you, (inaudible).  (Applause.)

And I am profoundly grateful to everyone at America’s Airfield.  That’s what they call it: America’s Airfield.  I use it often.  (Laughter.)

There is no greater honor than to serve as your Commander-in-Chief.  I especially want to thank the incredible people who fly and maintain Air Force One.  You are the best of the best.  Thank you very much for doing such an incredible job.  (Applause.)

Today’s signing of the 2020 NDAA is a watershed event in the truest sense of the word.  Before I came into office, the military endured deep and devastating budget cuts.  Our military, quite frankly, was very depleted.

As a candidate for President, I promised to reverse these crippling cuts, and to ensure our military remains unchallenged and unrivaled anywhere in the world.  And, right now, there is no one — there is no country that comes even close.  (Applause.)

The law I am signing today provides $738 billion — that’s with a “B.”  Seven hundred and thirty-eight billion dollars in defense funding for the 2020.  That’s an all-time record.  In the history of our country, that’s the highest amount we’ve ever spent on our military.  And that’s after $700 billion in my first year, and $716 billion last year.  And it’s all made, right here, in the USA.  That’s very important.  (Applause.)

And I have to say that we make the finest equipment, the finest planes, finest missiles, the finest ships.  We make the finest equipment anywhere in the world.  It’s not even close.

This brings our total investment in national defense, since my inauguration, to almost two and a half trillion dollars.  And what’s the good of a budget if you don’t have the best military in the world?

And, now, we focus on the budget a little bit.  Is that okay?  We’ll focus on the budget.  Two and a half trillion dollars.  So, that’s really something.  And it’s new, and it’s beautiful, and within the next 12 months you’ll have most of it.

In addition to massive acquisitions, in the past two years, this bill authorizes nearly 100 new F-35s; 24 brand-new F/A-18s; 155 Army helicopters, of all different types; 165 brand-new, beautiful Abrams tanks, said to be the best in the world; more than 50 Paladin howitzers; 2 new Virginia-class submarines; 3 new Arleigh Burke destroyers; a Ford-Class aircraft carrier, and two others on their way; and much, much more.

But as we discussed earlier, our military is getting far more than just new equipment.

For this first time — and I have to say, you know what happened last year?  It was a good pay raise, but now you’re getting another pay raise.  And this will be the largest pay raise in more than 10 years — more than a decade.  So, if you don’t want it, you don’t have to take it.  (Applause.)

For the first time since President Harry Truman created the Air Force over 70 years ago — think of that — we will create a brand-new American military service.  That’s such a momentous statement: 70 years ago, the Air Force.

With my signature today, you will witness the birth of the Space Force, and that will be now officially the sixth branch of the United States Armed Forces.  That is something really incredible.  (Applause.)  It’s a big moment.  That’s a big moment, and we’re all here for it.  Space.  Going to be a lot of things happening in space.

Because space is the world’s newest warfighting domain.  Amid grave threats to our national security, American superiority in space is absolutely vital.  And we’re leading, but we’re not leading by enough.  But very shortly, we’ll be leading by a lot.
The Space Force will help us deter aggression and control the ultimate high ground.

I particularly want to thank Vice President Mike Pence.  He was so involved in this with me.  This was a — a real — we had the spirit, the love that — I think we can say, Mike, that we both had for this project.  Because we realized how important it is to our military, to our future, to our defense — so important.  And it’s going to blend in magnificently with everything else that we have.  So, I want to thank Mike Pence.  Mike, thank you very much.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Great job, Mike.  (Applause.)

It was nearly half a century from Kitty Hawk to the creation of the Air Force.  And now it’s 50 years after Apollo 11 that we create the Space Force.  With today’s signing, I will proudly appoint General Jay Raymond the first Chief of Space Operations.  And he will become the very first member of the Space Force.  And he will be on the Joint Chiefs.  He will be on the Joint Chiefs, which we’re now expanding by one position.  That’s a very powerful position.  So, General Raymond, congratulations, and thank you for you everything you’ve done.  (Applause.)

The 2020 NDA[A} also protects the vital legal tools we need to defend America’s borders.  The law improves education, childcare, and private housing for military families, and it ends the so-called “widow’s tax,” which blocked benefits for families of fallen heroes.  The tax is gone.  (Applause.)  It was very important.  That was very important to us.  The “widow’s tax” is gone.

After years of unrealized promises by other politicians, I honor my commitment today as I sign paid parental leave — (applause) — for the federal civilian workforce.  That’s paid, into law.  So thank you very much.  That’s a very big thing: paid parental leave.  Another thing that they’ve been trying to get for many years.

As we head into Christmas, I am proud to report that we are giving every soldier, sailor, airman, Coast Guardsman, and Marine a well-earned pay raise.  In January, each of you will see the largest increase that you have had in such a long time.  In fact, it goes back so far that a lot of people don’t even know what that day it is.  I can just tell you: It’s a lot of money.  And I say it, and I say it again;: If you’d like not to take it, if you’d like to make a donation to your great country, please just let us know.  We’ll give you a little bit less.  (Laughter.)  Any takers, by the way?  I don’t know.  No, congratulations on that.

With this legislation, we show our undying commitment to the warriors who keep us safe.  These are incredible warriors.  These are brave, powerful warriors.  And now they have the best equipment anywhere in the world and it’s not even close.

Just weeks ago, U.S. Special Forces brought the world’s most-wanted terrorist to justice.  The monstrous animal known as al-Baghdadi, the founder and leader of ISIS, is dead.  And his second was just given the post of being in charge, and he is also dead.  (Applause.)

Within three years of record military investment, our country has rejected a future of American decline and embraced our destiny of American dominance.  Our military is now dominant — far ahead of any of our competitors.  And if you saw where we started from, not so long ago, you’d really be amazed.

I want to thank everybody, but I want to also thank those great companies that really designed — made this equipment.  Because I have seen it and I’ve seen much of it in action, and I’ve, frankly, never seen anything like it in my life.  So I just want to congratulate you all.  Because together, we’re protecting our people, our values, our traditions, and our glorious American Flag.  (Applause.)

I want to just end by wishing our armed forces — our great people — a very Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year.  God bless you.  God bless our military.  And God bless America.  God bless America.  (Applause.)

So it’s now my honor to sign the 2020 National Defense Authorization Act into law.  And again, congratulations.  Thank you all very much.  Very, very special people.  Thank you very much.  (Applause.)

This is the thickness.  Can you believe that?  (Laughter.)

(The act is signed.)

It’s now signed.  (Applause.)",President,Donald Trump,https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefings-statements/remarks-president-trump-signing-ceremony-s-1790-national-defense-authorization-act-fiscal-year-2020/,,DEVELOPMENT
USA,25-05-2021 00:00,Joe Biden,Statement by President Joe Biden on the First Anniversary of George Floyd’s Murder,"Today, in the Oval Office, I met with George Floyd’s family.

Although it has been one year since their beloved brother and father was murdered, for the family – for any family experiencing a profound loss – the first year can still feel like they got the news a few seconds ago. And they’ve had to relive that pain and grief each and every time those horrific 9 minutes and 29 seconds have been replayed.

Yet the Floyd family has shown extraordinary courage, especially his young daughter Gianna, who I met again today. The day before her father’s funeral a year ago, Jill and I met the family and she told me, “Daddy changed the world.”

He has.

His murder launched a summer of protest we hadn’t seen since the Civil Rights era in the ‘60s – protests that peacefully unified people of every race and generation to collectively say enough of the senseless killings.

Last month’s conviction of the police officer who murdered George was another important step forward toward justice. But our progress can’t stop there.

To deliver real change, we must have accountability when law enforcement officers violate their oaths, and we need to build lasting trust between the vast majority of the men and women who wear the badge honorably and the communities they are sworn to serve and protect. We can and must have both accountability and trust and in our justice system. 

The negotiations on the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act in Congress are ongoing. I have strongly supported the legislation that passed the House, and I appreciate the good-faith efforts from Democrats and Republicans to pass a meaningful bill out of the Senate. It’s my hope they will get a bill to my desk quickly.

We have to act. We face an inflection point. The battle for the soul of America has been a constant push and pull between the American ideal that we’re all created equal and the harsh reality that racism has long torn us apart.

At our best, the American ideal wins out. 

It must again.

Weekly Address: Coming Together to Find Solutions"," Hi, everybody.  It’s been a challenging couple weeks.  The shootings in Minnesota and Baton Rouge; the protests; the targeting and murder of police officers in Dallas – it’s left all of us struggling to make sense of things at times.  Now, I know that for many, it can feel like the deepest fault lines of our democracy have suddenly been exposed, and even widened. 

But the America I know – the America I saw this week – is just not as divided as some folks try to insist.  I saw it on Monday, when I met with law enforcement to talk about the challenges they face, and how too often, we ask our police to do too much – to be social workers, and teachers, guardians, and drug counselors as well. 

I saw it on Tuesday, when I traveled to Dallas for the memorial service for the five courageous officers who died in the line of duty – even as they were protecting protesters with whom they may have disagreed.

I saw it on Wednesday, when I hosted police chiefs, Black Lives Matter activists, state and local leaders, and others for a discussion that lasted more than four hours – a discussion on more steps we can take to continue supporting the police who keep our streets safe, and instill confidence that the law applies to everyone equally. 

And I saw it on Thursday, at a town hall in D.C., where we talked about how there is no contradiction between honoring police and recognizing the racial disparities that exist in our criminal justice system, and trying to fix these discrepancies.

These conversations were candid, challenging, even uncomfortable at times.  But that’s the point.  We have to be able to talk about these things, honestly and openly, not just in the comfort of our own circles, but with folks who look differently and think differently than we do.  Otherwise, we’ll never break this dangerous cycle.  And that’s what America’s all about.  Not just finding policies that work – but forging consensus, fighting cynicism, and finding the political will to keep changing this country for the better. 

That’s what America gives us – all of us – the capacity to change.

It won’t happen overnight.  The issues we’re grappling with go back decades, even centuries.  But if we can open our hearts to try and see ourselves in one another; if we can worry less about which side has been wronged, and worry more about joining sides to do right, as equal parts of one American family – then I’m confident that together, we will lead our country to a better day. 

Thanks everybody.  Have a great weekend.",President,Barack Obama,https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/the-press-office/2016/07/16/weekly-address-coming-together-find-solutions,,OTHERS
USA,07-11-2014,Barack Obama,"
Remarks by the President Before Cabinet Meeting","Well, this morning we learned that in October our businesses added 209,000 new jobs.  The unemployment rate fell again.  Our private sector has now added 10.6 million new jobs over the last 56 months, and this is the strongest job growth that we have seen since the 1990s. 

And all this is a testament to the hard work and resilience of the American people.  They have been steady and strong digging themselves out of the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression.  And what we need now to do is to make sure that we build on this momentum, because we recognize that despite the solid growth, despite the drop in unemployment, there are still a lot of folks out there who are anxious about their futures, who are having trouble making ends meet at the end of the month or saving for their kids’ college education, or being able to make sure that they're able to retire with dignity and respect.  And so everything that we do for the next two years is designed and geared towards ensuring that folks who work hard in this country are able to get ahead.

Now, obviously, we’ve had a significant midterm election.  As I said at the press conference, my attitude has been and will continue to be that good ideas don't necessarily come from just one party.  And I’m looking forward to seeing the leaders of both Democratic and Republican caucuses this afternoon to have a chance to share with them both what I think we need to be doing to build on the economic momentum that we already have and make it even stronger.  But I’m also going to be interested in listening to them in terms of areas where we think it’s possible to work together -- whether that is putting people back to work through stronger manufacturing here in the United States, and selling more to countries around the world -- one of the major topics that we're going to be discussing during my Asia trip next week; whether it’s figuring out how we can build on some modest new investments that we can make in early childhood education.  We know that works.  And there’s strong bipartisan support around the country for some of those investments.  Let’s see if we can do more.

All these issues are ones in which there’s a strong possibility of bipartisan cooperation, as long as we set politics aside for a moment and focus on the people who actually sent us here.

In the meantime, in these regular meetings that I’m having with my Cabinet, I’ve been emphasizing to them from day one and will reiterate in this meeting the fact that separate and apart from legislative activity, we have the capacity to continually improve how we deliver services to the American people.  Part of what’s happened over a course of several decades is that people sometimes feel as if the federal government is distant, that it’s not customer-friendly, that there’s too much bureaucracy. 

And because of the fine work of many of the members of this Cabinet, what we’ve been able to do is start chipping away at some of the old ways of doing business and start instituting new ways of doing business that improve customer service, that make sure that people are getting the help they need.

This week, I had a chance to welcome and have a conversation with our new Secretary of Veterans Affairs, Bob McDonald, who is coming from the private sector, but also is coming from West Point and an extraordinary legacy of service in our Armed Forces.  And what we’re already seeing is that Bob is able to start skinnying down the wait times for people in terms of getting appointments that they need, but also building on successes that have been taking place over the last several years -- reducing homelessness, for example.  With our HUD Secretaries Donovan and now Castro, we’ve reduced veterans homelessness by 30 percent.  And a lot of that’s not by virtue of new legislation, it’s just by us focusing more on these problems and managing them better, and continually listening to the American people to see how we can be more helpful.

So there are a lot of opportunities for us to do that here today.  We’re going to I think take an inventory of the progress that’s being made in various departments.  We’re also going to focus on the fact that between now and the end of the year there’s still some immediate work that needs to be done.

We have made progress in building the kind of public health infrastructure we need to deal with any eventualities with respect to Ebola, but it is still a concern both here domestically but, most importantly, still a concern internationally.  So we’ll get reports from Sylvia Burwell as well as Susan Rice and others who have been actively involved in that fight.  And Ron Klain, who’s here, will tell us how the work we need to be doing with Congress can help advance and ultimately stamp out this epidemic overseas to make sure that the American people are safe. 

We also have some significant national security issues.  We’ve got to make sure that our efforts against ISIL are properly funded, and so it will be an opportunity for Secretary of Defense Hagel to brief us on the progress in our campaign against ISIL in Iraq and some of the work they’re doing in Syria.

So bottom line is that, as I’ve told my White House staff and I’ve shared in the past with many of my Cabinet, we are extraordinarily privileged to be in a position where every single day we can have a positive impact in some way on the lives of the American people.  And when I started out on this journey with Joe Biden, and we traveled around the country, we were constantly reminded of the hard work, of the sense of community, the sense of family that exists in every pocket and every corner of this country -- the same kinds of values that Joe grew up on and I grew up on. 

And what we want to do is to make sure that between now and the time that the next administration takes over, that every single day, in every single agency, we are constantly finding ways to build on those values and to make sure that we are making this country safer and more prosperous.  And I know that based on the conversations I’ve had with this Cabinet, there is no lack of enthusiasm or energy in achieving that goal.

Thank you very much, everybody.",President,Barack Obama,https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/the-press-office/2014/11/07/remarks-president-cabinet-meeting,,DEVELOPMENT
USA,24-02-2020 00:00,Donald Trump,Remarks by President Trump at a Namaste Trump Rally,"PRESIDENT TRUMP:  Namaste!  Namaste.  (Applause.)  And hello to India.  This is such a great honor.  Let me begin by expressing my profound gratitude to an exceptional leader, a great champion of India, a man who works night and day for his country, and a man I am proud to call my true friend: Prime Minister Modi.  (Applause.)

The First Lady and I have just traveled 8,000 miles around the globe to deliver a message to every citizen across this nation: America loves India, America respects India, and America will always be faithful and loyal friends to the Indian people.  (Applause.)

Five months ago, the United States welcomed your great Prime Minister at a giant football stadium in Texas, and today, India welcomes us at the world’s largest cricket stadium right here in Ahmedabad.  (Applause.)  It is a profound honor to be the beautiful new stadium, to be here with you — Motera Stadium.  So beautiful.  (Applause.)  And joined by so many distinguished guests from all across your nation and all across the world.

To the hundreds of thousands of everyday citizens who have come out and lined the streets in a stunning display of Indian culture and kindness, and to the 125,000 people in this great stadium today — (applause) — thank you for the spectacular welcome to your magnificent country.

You have done a great honor to the American people.  Melania and my family, we will always remember this remarkable hospitality.  We will remember it forever.  (Applause.)  From this day on, India will always hold a very special place in our hearts.  (Applause.)

The life of Prime Minister Modi underscores the limitless promise of this great nation.  He started out by his father’s side as a chai wala — (applause) — a tea-seller.  When he was a young man, he worked at a cafeteria in this city.

AUDIENCE:  Modi!  Modi!  Modi!

PRESIDENT TRUMP:  Stand up.  (Applause.)  Everybody loves him, but I will tell you this: He’s very tough.  (Laughs.)  (Applause.)

Today, Prime Minister Modi is the tremendously successful leader of this vast Indian Republic.  Last year, more than 600 million people went to the polls and gave him a landslide victory like no other in the largest democratic election ever held anywhere on the face of the Earth.  (Applause.)

Prime Minister Modi, you are not just the pride of Gujarat — you are living proof that with hard work and devotion, Indians can accomplish anything — (applause) — anything at all, anything they want.  (Applause.)

The Prime Minister has a moving story of an incredible rise, and so does this entire nation.  Your nation is doing so well.  We are very, very proud of India.  (Applause.)  The story of the Indian nation is a tale of astounding progress, a miracle of democracy, extraordinary diversity, and above all, a strong and noble people.  India gives hope to all of humanity.

In just 70 years, India has become an economic giant, the largest democracy ever to exist, and one of the most amazing nations anywhere in the world.  (Applause.)

Since the turn of the century, India’s economy has grown more than six times in size.  In a single decade, India has lifted over 270 million people out of poverty.

Under Prime Minister Modi, for the first time in history, every village in India now has access to electricity.  (Applause.)  Three hundred and twenty million people — more Indians — are right now connected to the Internet.  (Applause.)   The pace of highway construction has more than doubled.  Over 70 million more households — think of this — 70 million more households have access to cooking fuel; 600 million more people have access to basic sanitation; and, incredibly, 12 Indian citizens are lifted out of extreme poverty every single minute of every single day.  (Applause.)

India will soon be the home of the biggest middle class anywhere in the world.  And within less than 10 years, extreme poverty in your country is projected to completely disappear.  (Applause.)  The potential for India is absolutely incredible.

India’s rise as a prosperous and independent nation is an example to every nation all over the world and one of the most outstanding achievements of our century.  It is all the more inspiring because you have done it as a democratic country, you have done it as a peaceful country, you have done it as a tolerant country, and you have done it as a great free country.  (Applause.)

There is all the difference in the world between a nation that seeks power through coercion, intimidation, and aggression, and a nation that rises by setting its people free and unleashing them to chase their dreams.  And that is India.  (Applause.)  This is why India’s accomplishment over the last 70 years is completely unrivaled no matter where you go.

It is your faith in the strength of a free society, your confidence in your own people, your trust in your own citizens, and your respect for the dignity of every person that makes the United States and India such a natural, beautiful, enduring friendship.  (Applause.)

While our nations have many differences, they are both defined and propelled by a fundamental truth: the truth that all of us are blessed with divine light, and every person is endowed with a sacred soul.

As the great religious teacher, Swami Vivekananda, once said — (applause) — “The moment I stand in reverence before every human being and see God in Him, that moment I am free.”  (Applause.)

In America and in India, we know that we are all born for a higher purpose: to reach toward our fullest potential, to work toward excellence and perfection, and to give all glory to God.

Powered by this spirit, Indians and Americans are always striving to be greater, our people are always seeking to be better, and so our nations have become thriving centers of culture and commerce and civilization, giving light and vitality to all of the world.

This is the country that produces nearly 2,000 movies a year from the hub of genius and creativity known as Bollywood!  (Applause.)  All over the planet, people take great joy in scenes of Bhangra music, dance, romance and drama, and classic Indian films like DDLJ and Sholay.  (Applause.)

This is the country where your people cheer on some of the world’s greatest cricket players — from Sachin Tendulkar to Virat Kohli.  (Applause.)  The greatest in the world.

This is the country that built the tallest statue on the face of the Earth to honor the namesake of this stadium, the great Indian patriot and native of this state, Sardar Patel.  (Applause.)

India is the country where hundreds of millions of — light candles to celebrate the triumph of good over evil at Diwali.   (Applause.)  And it’s where, just days from now, Indians of all faiths will pour out onto the streets to celebrate the beautiful festival of Holi.  (Applause.)

India is a country that proudly embraces freedom, liberty, individual rights, the rule of law, and the dignity of every human being.

Your nation has always been admired around the Earth as the place where millions upon millions of Hindus and Muslims and Sikhs and Jains, Buddhists, Christians, and Jews worship side by side in harmony; where you speak more than 100 languages and come from more than two dozen states, yet you have always stood strong as one great Indian nation.  (Applause.)  Your unity is an inspiration to the world.

In America, we have come to know the splendor of Indian culture personally, through the 4 million Indian Americans living in the United States as our wonderful friends, colleagues, and neighbors.  They are truly spectacular people.  (Applause.)

Indian Americans enrich every aspect of our national life.  They are titans of business; the biggest, the best pioneers of science; masters of the art; and innovation of technology like few people have been able to see no matter where you go anywhere in this universe.

Nearly one in four Indian Americans trace their roots right here in Gujarat.  (Applause.)  Gujarat is a special place.

So on behalf of the entire American people, thank you and thank you all for the contributions your culture and traditions have made to my beloved country.  (Applause.)

Americans are eager to strengthen these beautiful ties between our two people.  This is truly an exciting time in the United States.  Our economy is booming like never before.  Our people are prospering and spirits are soaring.  There is tremendous love, tremendous like.  We like and we love everybody.
Unemployment has hit historic lows, and small business confidence has hit an all-time record high in the history of our country.

Our military has been completely rebuilt; it is now stronger than ever before.  And we are quickly revitalizing our alliances and friendships all around the world.  We have spent two and a half trillion dollars on rebuilding our military.  It’s the most powerful military anywhere in the world, by far.  (Applause.)

That is why I have come here to India, in the spirit of fondness and goodwill, to expand our cherished partnership of incredible power and potential.

The First Lady and I have just had a pleasure of visiting Mahatma Gandhi’s Ashram, a few miles from here, where he launched the famous “Salt March.”  (Applause.)

And tomorrow in Delhi, we will lay a wreath, plant a tree at Raj Ghat in honor of this leader who is revered all around the world.

And the First Lady and I look forward to visiting one of your country’s most iconic landmarks.  We are later today going to see the majestic Taj Mahal.  (Applause.)

The Prime Minister and I will also continue our important discussions about how to deepen the relationship between our two great countries.  Both of us understand that when leaders put the interests of their own citizens first, we can forge strong and fair partnerships to build a safer and more prosperous world.

Just months ago, this critical partnership took a major step forward when the U.S. military and your brave Indian Armed Forces conducted the first-ever air, land, and sea military exercises between our two countries.  It was something to behold.  We called it “Tiger Triumph.”  (Applause.)

As we continue to build our defense cooperation, the United States looks forward to providing India with some of the best and most feared military equipment on the planet.  We make the greatest weapons ever made: airplanes, missiles, rockets, ships.  We make the best.  And we’re dealing now with India.  But this includes advanced air defense systems and armed and unarmed aerial vehicles.

And I am pleased to announce that, tomorrow, our representatives will sign deals to sell over $3 billion in the absolute finest, state-of-the-art military helicopters and other equipment to the Indian Armed Forces.  (Applause.)

I believe that the United States should be India’s premier defense partner, and that’s the way it’s working out.  Together, we will defend our sovereignty, security, and protect a free and open Indo-Pacific region for our children and for many, many generations to come.

The United States and India are also firmly united in our ironclad resolve to defend our citizens from the threat of radical Islamic terrorism.  (Applause.)

Both of our countries have been hurt by the pain and turmoil of terrorism and that terrorism brings.  Under my administration, we unleashed the full power of the American military on bloodthirsty killers of ISIS in Iraq and in Syria.  (Applause.)  Today, the ISIS territorial caliphate has been 100 percent destroyed.  And the monster known as al-Baghdadi, the founder and leader of ISIS, is dead.  (Applause.)

In the United States, we have also made clear that while our country will always welcome newcomers who share our values and love our people, our borders will always be closed to terrorists and terrorism and to any form of extremism.

That is why we have taken historic steps to improve screening and vetting of applications for entry, and we are working to ensure that anyone who threatens the security of our citizens is denied admission and will pay a very, very big, costly price.  (Applause.)

Every nation has the right to secure and controlled borders.  The United States and India are committed to working together to stop terrorists and to fight their ideology.  (Applause.)

For this reason, since taking office, my administration is working in a very positive way with Pakistan to crack down on the terrorist organizations and militants that operate on the Pakistani border.  (Applause.)  Our relationship with Pakistan is a very good one.

Thanks to these efforts, we are beginning to see signs of big progress with Pakistan.  And we are hopeful for reduced tensions, greater stability, and the future of harmony for all of the nations of South Asia.

India has an important leadership role to play in shaping a better future as you take on greater responsibility for solving problems and promoting peace throughout this incredible region.

Over the course of my visit, Prime Minister Modi and I will also discuss our efforts to expand the economic ties between our two countries.  We will be making very, very major — among the biggest ever made — trade deals.  (Applause.)

We are in the early stages of discussion for an incredible trade agreement to reduce barriers of investment between the United States and India.  And I am optimistic that, working together, the Prime Minister and I can reach a fantastic deal that’s good and even great for both of our countries.  (Applause.)  Except that he’s a very tough negotiator.  (Laughs.)

Since my inauguration, commerce between our two nations has increased by more than 40 percent.  India is now a major market for American exports, and the United States is India’s largest export market.  (Applause.)  A booming America is great thing for India and it’s great for the world.  And that’s why we’re so happy to announce that we have the greatest economy ever in the history of the United States.

In America, we have proven that the best way to attract jobs and opportunity is to reduce burdens on business, knock down barriers to new investment, and eliminate unnecessary bureaucracy, red tape, regulation, and taxes.  Prime Minister Modi has already made significant reforms here in your country, as you very well know.  The world looks forward to even more rapid improvement to India’s business climate under his leadership.  He wants to do it, and he’s doing it at a record pace.

Two years ago, Prime Minister Modi warmly welcomed my daughter Ivanka to the Global Entrepreneurship Summit in Hyderabad.  And she is back with us today.  Ivanka, thank you.  Thank you for being here, honey.  (Applause.)

We are delighted to be joined as well by dozens of Indian women entrepreneurs who are helping to build your nation’s future.  They are great and natural entrepreneurs.  And I just say to the men: Be very careful.  They’re really good.  (Applause.)

The United States and India are also working closely together on the future of space exploration.  You are making impressive strides with your exciting Chandrayaan Lunar Program.  (Applause.)  It is moving along rapidly, far ahead of schedule, and America looks forward to expanding our space cooperation with India as you push even further.  You are pushing the limits — and that’s a great thing — including in realm of human spaceflight.  (Applause.)  The United States and India will be friends and partners on our voyage into the stars and into space.

It is truly extraordinary what this nation has achieved in the span of just one lifetime.  And what they have done under the leadership of Prime Minister Modi, it is absolutely incredible.  Mr. Prime Minister, congratulations.  (Applause.)  Fantastic.

You have come so far, but it is nothing compared to with how far India will go into the future.  And the Prime Minister is laying the foundations for a future like few other countries can even think of.

This nation is blessed with many treasures.  From the sacred banks of the Ganges, to the Golden Temple, and the Jama Masjid, it is home to some of the most cherished cultural heritage anywhere on Earth.

It is also a land of stunning vistas and astonishing natural wonders, from the rugged peaks of the Himalayas to the splendid shores of Goa.  (Applause.)

And India has always been a wellspring of deep wisdom and great ideas — from the Vedas and the ancient epics, all the way up to the modern India nation.

But standing before all of you today, I know that true strength of India is not found in its textbooks, its landmarks or its landscapes.  The true strength of India is found in 125,000 beating hearts in this stadium and the millions and millions of people who have seen and witnessed our great friendship and admiration today.  It is all found in the soul and the spirit of the Indian people.

Your courage won and secured this nation’s independence. Your devotion built this great and enduring democracy.  And it is your dreams that will power this country to a future — even greater progress, prosperity, equality, and opportunity for every citizen across your land.

So today I say to every Indian — North and South, Hindu and Muslim, Jewish and Christian, rich and poor, young and old: Take pride in the glories of your past, unite for an even brighter future, and let our two nations always stand together as powerful defenders of peace and liberty, and the hope of a better world for all of humanity.

Thank you again, Prime Minister Modi, for your hospitality. And thank you, India, for this phenomenal welcome.  (Applause.)

I want to just leave by saying: God bless India.  God bless the United States of America.  We love you.  We love you, India, very much.  Thank you.  Thank you.

China,30-01-2018 00:00,H.E. Wang Yi,Remarks by H.E. Wang Yi Minister of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China At the 2018 New Year Reception,"Your Excellency Yang Jiechi, Member of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and State Councilor, and Madame Le Aimei,
Your Excellencies Ambassadors, Members of the Diplomatic Corps, Representatives of International Organizations and Your Spouses,
Ladies and Gentlemen,
Friends,

Good evening!

Let me begin by warmly welcoming all of you to the 2018 New Year Reception of the Chinese Foreign Ministry. It is a real delight to see so many friends, both old and new, on this joyful occasion where we will together look back at the past year and look forward to the new one.

Over the past year, Your Excellencies have contributed enormously to China's growing friendship and cooperation with the rest of the world, while other Chinese government departments and local authorities have also given us valuable support for China's diplomatic activities. On behalf of the Foreign Ministry, I wish to salute and thank all of you for your good efforts.

The year 2017 saw a renewed hope for world peace and growth amid volatility and transformation. There is a growing call for a world of greater security and stability achieved through cooperation and development.

The year 2017 also witnessed the 19th National Congress of the Communist Party of China, which marked a new era in socialism with Chinese characteristics. At this Congress, a general goal was set for China's diplomacy - to foster a new type of international relations and to build a community with a shared future for mankind; a two-stage blueprint for a modern socialist China was drawn up; and China's commitment to working with other countries for a bright future was fully demonstrated.

Over the last year, under the strong leadership of the CPC Central Committee with Comrade Xi Jinping at its core, China has made new progress on the diplomatic front. We have adapted to new development challenges at home and to an evolving global landscape. With a strong sense of mission, we have served the Chinese dream of national rejuvenation. In a pioneering spirit, we have contributed to the world dream of lasting peace and shared prosperity.

We have forged greater synergy for the Belt and Road Initiative. The first Belt and Road Forum for International Cooperation yielded over 270 outcomes and facilitated a number of major cooperation projects, creating a strong momentum of extensive participation from around the world. Today, the Belt and Road has become the biggest platform for international cooperation and a most welcomed international public good.

We have made great efforts to steer globalization in the right direction. On various occasions from Davos to Geneva, and from Hamburg to Da Nang, President Xi Jinping presented to the world China's vision of greater balance in economic globalization and of a community with a shared future for mankind. He also elaborated on China's proposals for an open world economy and for greater economic integration in the Asia Pacific. Those remarks instilled confidence and positive energy into the international community.

We have explored more avenues to advance our mutually beneficial relations with other countries. New progress has been made in our coordination and cooperation with other major countries like the United States and Russia and with Europe. Our mutual trust and cooperation with our neighbors has been strengthened, and more substance has been added to our partnerships with other developing countries. China's preference for dialogue and partnership over confrontation and alliance has created greater resonance, which opens up exciting possibilities for this new approach to state-to-state relations.

We have initiated a new model for BRICS cooperation. At their Summit in Xiamen, BRICS leaders decided to forge a closer, broader and more comprehensive strategic partnership and to further upgrade BRICS cooperation. The new ""BRICS plus"" approach adopted at the Summit will turn BRICS into a new platform for South-South cooperation with global influence.

Ladies and Gentlemen,
Friends,

One hundred and twenty years ago, in a China that was poor and weak from domestic turmoil and foreign aggression, some dedicated patriots pushed for a ""Hundred Days' Reform"". They tried but eventually failed to find a way to national rejuvenation and prosperity. Today, 120 years on, China has not only found its path of socialism with Chinese characteristics but also achieved a remarkable transformation - it has stood up, grown rich and is becoming strong. A sea change has taken place in China, which represents new opportunities for the peace and development of the world.

The year 2018 marks the 40th anniversary of China's reform and opening-up policy and the first year following the 19th CPC National Congress. We will follow the guidance of Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era, stay committed to peaceful development and make new progress in major country diplomacy with Chinese characteristics.

In 2018, we look forward to a world of greater openness and less isolation. The green shoots in the new round of global growth must be nurtured by all countries. What China has learnt in its 40 years of reform and opening up is that prosperity only comes to those who embrace the world with open arms. China will remain committed to opening up as a fundamental policy and a mutually beneficial strategy. We will stay actively engaged in reforming and developing the global governance system to make economic globalization more open, inclusive and balanced so that its benefits can be shared by all. We will work on the Belt and Road Initiative by implementing deliverables of the first Forum and starting preparations for the second one. This way, we can break new ground in opening up. We will host a number of events like the annual conference of the Boao Forum for Asia, the Summit of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, the Summit of the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation, and the China International Import Expo to add momentum to the trend of openness and development.

In 2018, we look forward to a world of more cooperation and less friction. China will expand its global network of partnerships and build a framework for major country relations featuring overall stability and balanced development. With regard to our relations with neighbors, we will follow the principles of amity, sincerity, mutual benefit and inclusiveness. We will broaden cooperation and narrow differences with them to jointly build a community of shared future in Asia. We will uphold justice while pursuing shared interests for greater solidarity and cooperation with other developing countries. We will add new dimensions to our cooperation mechanisms with Africa, Latin America and the Caribbean, and Arab countries to keep the mechanisms vibrant in changing circumstances. Such efforts will enable us to set an example for a new type of international relations.

In 2018, we look forward to a world of more trust and less estrangement. To navigate the complicated international landscape, countries need to have more mutual trust and less suspicion. Efforts must be made to find political solutions to long-running hotspots and thorny issues and bring about outcomes that will benefit all parties. The current momentum of easing tensions on the Korean Peninsula presents all parties with an opportunity to demonstrate greater sincerity for dialogue and negotiation and to facilitate more good interactions. To put it more broadly, as a partner that all sides can count on, China will continue to uphold the equality of countries, regardless of their size, strength and wealth, stand for dialogue and consultation as the only approach to disputes and differences, support political settlement to regional hotspots and act constructively to that end. It is our sincere hope that dialogue and cooperation will prevail in our world.

Given the fact that China is still the world's largest developing country, serving development at home has therefore remained the top priority in China's diplomatic agenda. We will act upon the new development philosophy, present Chinese provinces, regions and cities to the world under the theme of ""China in the New Era"", and serve the coordinated development of the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region, the planning and development of the Xiongan New Area and the 2022 Winter Olympics. We will explore a mechanism for protecting the safety and security of Chinese nationals abroad to effectively safeguard our legitimate rights and interests.

Ladies and gentlemen,
Friends,

To celebrate the arrival of spring is a tradition shared by people of many ethnicities around the world. As we celebrate the forthcoming spring, we want to express our hope for a bright future of greater happiness and prosperity. In the new year, we look forward to continued communication and cooperation with you and to mutual support and coordination with other departments and local governments. Let us work together to take China's friendship and cooperation with other countries to a new level and bring more benefits to the Chinese and other peoples.

Now, please join me in a toast:

To the rejuvenation of the Chinese nation,
To the peace and development of the world,
To the friendship between the Chinese and other peoples, and
To the health and happiness of all the distinguished guests present.

Cheers!",State Councilor and Foreign Minister of the People's Republic of China,Xi Jinping,https://www.fmprc.gov.cn/mfa_eng/wjdt_665385/zyjh_665391/t1530525.shtml,,INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS
USA,15-08-2013,Barack Obama,"
Remarks by the President on the Situation in Egypt","Good morning, everybody.  I just finished a discussion with my national security team about the situation in Egypt, and I wanted to provide an update about our response to the events of the last several days.
 
Let me begin by stepping back for a moment.  The relationship between the United States and Egypt goes back decades.  It’s rooted in our respect of Egypt as a nation, an ancient center of civilization, and a cornerstone for peace in the Middle East.  It’s also rooted in our ties to the Egyptian people, forged through a longstanding partnership.
 
Just over two years ago, America was inspired by the Egyptian people’s desire for change as millions of Egyptians took to the streets to defend their dignity and demand a government that was responsive to their aspirations for political freedom and economic opportunity.  And we said at the time that change would not come quickly or easily, but we did align ourselves with a set of principles:  nonviolence, a respect for universal rights, and a process for political and economic reform.  In doing so, we were guided by values but also by interests, because we believe nations are more stable and more successful when they're guided by those principles as well.
 
And that's why we’re so concerned by recent events.  We appreciate the complexity of the situation.  While Mohamed Morsi was elected President in a democratic election, his government was not inclusive and did not respect the views of all Egyptians.  We know that many Egyptians, millions of Egyptians, perhaps even a majority of Egyptians were calling for a change in course.  And while we do not believe that force is the way to resolve political differences, after the military’s intervention several weeks ago, there remained a chance for reconciliation and an opportunity to pursue a democratic path.
 
Instead, we’ve seen a more dangerous path taken through arbitrary arrests, a broad crackdown on Mr. Morsi’s associations and supporters, and now tragically the violence that's taken the lives of hundreds of people and wounded thousands more.
 
The United States strongly condemns the steps that have been taken by Egypt’s interim government and security forces.  We deplore violence against civilians.  We support universal rights essential to human dignity, including the right to peaceful protest.  We oppose the pursuit of martial law, which denies those rights to citizens under the principle that security trumps individual freedom, or that might makes right.  And today the United States extends its condolences to the families of those who were killed and those who were wounded.
 
And given the depths of our partnership with Egypt, our national security interests in this pivotal part of the world and our belief that engagement can support a transition back to a democratically elected civilian government, we’ve sustained our commitment to Egypt and its people.  But while we want to sustain our relationship with Egypt, our traditional cooperation cannot continue as usual when civilians are being killed in the streets and rights are being rolled back. 
 
As a result, this morning we notified the Egyptian government that we are canceling our biannual joint military exercise which was scheduled for next month.  Going forward I’ve asked my national security team to assess the implications of the actions taken by the interim government and further steps that we may take as necessary with respect to the U.S.-Egyptian relationship. 
 
Let me say that the Egyptian people deserve better than what we’ve seen over the last several days.  And to the Egyptian people, let me say the cycle of violence and escalation needs to stop.  We call on the Egyptian authorities to respect the universal rights of the people.  We call on those who are protesting to do so peacefully and condemn the attacks that we’ve seen by protesters, including on churches.  We believe that the state of emergency should be lifted, that a process of national reconciliation should begin, that all parties need to have a voice in Egypt’s future, that the rights of women and religious minorities should be respected, and that commitments must be kept to pursue transparent reforms of the constitution and democratic elections of a parliament and a President.
 
Pursuing that path with help Egypt meet the democratic aspirations of its people while attracting the investment, tourism and international support that can help it deliver opportunities to its citizens.  Violence, on the other hand, will only feed the cycle of polarization that isolates Egyptians from one another and from the world, and that continues to hamper the opportunity for Egypt to get back on the path of economic growth.
 
Let me make one final point.  America cannot determine the future of Egypt.  That's a task for the Egyptian people.  We don't take sides with any particular party or political figure.  I know it’s tempting inside of Egypt to blame the United States or the West or some other outside actor for what’s gone wrong.  We’ve been blamed by supporters of Morsi.  We’ve been blamed by the other side, as if we are supporters of Morsi.  That kind of approach will do nothing to help Egyptians achieve the future that they deserve. 
 
We want Egypt to succeed.  We want a peaceful, democratic, prosperous Egypt.  That's our interest.  But to achieve that, the Egyptians are going to have to do the work. 
 
We recognize that change takes time, and that a process like this is never guaranteed.  There are examples in recent history of countries that are transitioned out of a military government towards a democratic government, and it did not always go in a straight line, and the process was not always smooth.  There are going to be false starts.  There will be difficult days.  America’s democratic journey took us through some mighty struggles to perfect our union. 
 
From Asia to the Americas, we know that democratic transitions are measured not in months or even years, but sometimes in generations.  So in the spirit of mutual interest and mutual respect, I want to be clear that America wants to be a partner in the Egyptian people’s pursuit of a better future, and we are guided by our national interest in this longstanding relationship.  But our partnership must also advance the principles that we believe in and that so many Egyptians have sacrificed for these last several years -- no matter what party or faction they belong to.
 
So America will work with all those in Egypt and around the world who support a future of stability that rests on a foundation of justice and peace and dignity.
 
Thank you very much.",President,Barack Obama,https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/the-press-office/2013/08/15/remarks-president-situation-egypt,,INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS
Russia,30-03-2004,Vladimir Putin,Opening Address to the Board of the Federal Service for Control of Drugs and Psychotropic Substances,"Good afternoon, colleagues and participants of this meeting.

Your department was created as a special service to fight the drug trade. It was created to increase the effectiveness of this work and to coordinate the efforts of central and regional structures working in this area.

With these goals in mind, I would like to briefly summarise the initial results of the service’s work, and discuss plans for the future.

The drug trade and crime connected with it are among the most serious threats to the security of the Russian Federation. It was after evaluating this threat, and encountering it to its full extent, that we created a special service, a service with considerable power.

Drugs kill thousands of our fellow citizens. They do not just kill them directly, but also through the spread of AIDS and other infectious diseases. Profit from the illegal trade of drugs has become the financial basis for various types of criminal activities, including organised criminal groups and international terrorists.

We must admit that in recent years the level of drug use in Russia has grown, and the structure of the drug trade has expanded. Currently, two thirds of crimes connected with drugs fall into the category of grave and extremely grave crimes.

It is clear that it is necessary to further analyse and consolidate the legal base of the war on the drug trade, and also to improve the state system of fighting the illegal drug trade, as, unfortunately, work in this area has not yet brought the results expected by society.

The fact is that an established, well structured and extensive network of drug trading has arisen in Russia, including manufacture, transport and distribution of drugs.

Russian drug crime is becoming a part of the international drug mafia, and has already established an entire system of work at all levels, including legalising income from drugs abroad. Only when we come to understand the source of the threat, the scale of the threat, can we fight against it. Fight effectively, with clear results.

To achieve this, we should adopt the following priorities: above all, the financial base of the drug mafia needs to be minimised, and in the long term, to be liquidated. Its economic bases need to be undermined. To this end, we must fight against the legislation of income from criminal business, and cut off the channels for transferring money.

I want to stress that in addressing these tasks, your service is called upon to play a key role. You have the task of detecting the channels used for this transfer of money. I hope that you will do this effectively together with the recently created financial intelligence service.

We can effectively fight the illegal drug trade only through combined preventive, educational, medical and law-enforcement measures.

It must be clearly understood: drug addiction is a dangerous disease. It is at the same time a social disease and a disease of individual people. And we must think seriously about creating an accessible system of treatment and rehabilitation for people suffering from drug addiction.

The accessibility of drugs needs to be reduced, especially for young people. At the same time, it should be admitted that in themselves neither repressive policies nor legalisation of drugs, which have both been tried in various countries around the world, are able to fully solve this problem.

And finally, we need to direct preventive measures towards working with young people and social groups which are most susceptible to the threat of drug abuse.

To do this, there must be a thorough analysis of ways to implement the current federal programme to oppose the threat of drugs. The programme which already ends this year.

We need to draw the right conclusions and develop a specific and realistic plan of action, even if it is not a universal one, for the near future. This plan should be a practical one, and the result of it should be obvious, as I have already said.

Thirdly, the task of liquidating extensive networks of drug trade and criminal groups working in this sphere remains important. This task is to a large extent an operational one. And your service, in cooperation with other federal departments and regions, should think about how to combine efforts in this area.

I stress once more: we have a legal base and the resources for your most decisive actions.

Incidentally, when I talked of cooperation, I assumed that the jurisdiction will be divided between different bodies and departments working in this area. Your service is at the core of this, and should carry the main burden of work in this area.

To continue. For the war on the drug trade, wide social support is required. You will not be able to manage without the assistance of civil society organisations which combat drug addiction and drug trade. And here, collective educational work is very important, preventive and anti-drug campaign. We should oppose open and concealed promotion of drugs with the words and deeds of authoritative public leaders, and representatives of religion and cultural elite.

Another important aspect: drug trade is international. And so constant exchange of experience and information, and coordinated activity with colleagues in other countries, can greatly increase the effectiveness of the war on drugs.

Primarily, of course, this concerns our partners in CIS countries. And we must at least ensure efficient work within the framework of the CIS anti-drug programme for 2002–2004 and the Central Asian Memorandum on Cooperation in Controlling the Legal Manufacture and Trade of Drugs.

I expect that effective means for fighting the drug threat can be found in the format of the Collective Security Treaty Organisation and the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation.

Here, of course, efficient cooperation needs to be established with the border guards of both Russia and the CIS.

And finally, based on the international obligations of the Russian Federation, thought should be given to more effective ways to opposing smuggling of drugs and psychotropic substances from abroad.

The main task is to stop the transit of drugs through the territory of our country. To do this, as I have already said, the combined work of the FSB Border Service and colleagues from neighbouring countries is required. We need to stop attempts at drug smuggling, and not allow the expansion of transnational criminal groups in Russia.

Incidentally, the Security Council and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs need to develop unified and clear methods with our partners in the CIS in this area. I primarily mean cooperation in the border sphere. This, I should note, is not only a concern for Russia, but also for our partners in Western Europe and North America. It is a major international problem, and it must, of course, be solved together. The Interior Ministry should take the necessary steps in this area. We should understand clearly what we can expect in working with our partners, especially in Central Asia.

In conclusion, I would like to stress: in fighting the drug threat, not just aggressive tactics are required, but also precise calculation, and systematic and effective decisions.

I am sure that you realise the full extent of the responsibility that now lies on the system of bodies for controlling the drug trade and psychotropic substances, on every section of the department, on every employee. The task is extremely important. And I sincerely wish you success. The country expects results from you.",President,Vladimir Putin,http://en.kremlin.ru/events/president/transcripts/statements/22402,,OTHERS

While we do not yet know motive, as I said last week, we condemn in the strongest possible terms the ongoing crisis of gender-based and anti-Asian violence that has long plagued our nation. I urge Congress to swiftly pass the COVID-19 Hate Crimes Act, which would expedite the federal government’s response to the rise of hate crimes exacerbated during the pandemic, support state and local governments to improve hate crimes reporting, and ensure that hate crimes information is more accessible to Asian American communities.  I thank Senator Hirono, Congresswoman Meng, and Congressional Asian Pacific American Caucus Chairwoman Chu for their consistent leadership on this issue — and for their persistence in standing up for America’s values by standing strongly against anti-Asian xenophobia and hate.

During my first week in office, I signed a Presidential Memorandum to condemn and combat racism, xenophobia, and intolerance against Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders in the United States. I directed the Department of Justice and the Department of Health and Human Services to help lead our nation’s efforts to stop anti-Asian bias, xenophobia, and harassment.

As Governors, CEOs, and other public and private sector leaders come together at the 2021 SelectUSA Summit this week, I want to reiterate my administration’s commitment to ensuring that the United States remains the most attractive place in the world for businesses to invest and grow, thus creating jobs here at home, strengthening supply chains across the country, and deepening our relationships with allies and partners.

America has the most productive workforce in the world. We have an unmatched business environment strengthened by our culture of innovation and entrepreneurship, outstanding educational institutions, and commitment to transparency, protection of intellectual property, flexible and efficient capital markets, and the rule of law. We believe that our country – and our world – are safer, more resilient, and more prosperous because of the investment of foreign-owned companies in the United States.

As we continue to advance our agenda to revitalize American manufacturing, build an inclusive 21st century workforce, and maintain our competitive edge, the United States welcomes foreign investment. Today, U.S. subsidiaries of foreign-owned companies directly employ almost 8 million Americans and help boost U.S. innovation by investing $70 billion in research and development. They contribute to all sectors of the U.S. economy and are responsible for nearly 24% of all U.S. goods exports.

We will always protect our national security, and certain foreign investments will be reviewed by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States for this purpose. But, we will also maintain a level playing field. As the United States faces increasing competition for the jobs and industries of the future, we will remain the destination of choice for investors around the world.",President,Joe Biden,https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/06/08/statement-by-president-joe-biden-on-the-united-states-commitment-to-open-investment/,,DEVELOPMENT
Russia,10-01-2007 00:00,Vladimir Putin,Concluding Remarks at the VIIIth United Russia Party Congress,"Dear colleagues,

First of all, I would like to thank you for the analysis you made in your speeches and, of course, for your kind words and your serious employment proposals.

We all remember what state the country was in seven-eight years ago. A lot of people doubted that we would have the strength to combat terrorism and separatism and that we would even manage to hold the country together. We are still far from having solved all these problems. Russia still faces numerous threats and dangers, but we have succeeded in turning the situation around: constitutional order has been restored and our country’s territorial integrity is once again intact and guaranteed. We will continue our uncompromising fight against terrorism until this scourge is totally eradicated.

It looked at one time as though we would never manage to free ourselves from powerful oligarchs whose influence was based on corruption, violence and information blackmail. We have accomplished a great deal in terms of cleaning out this illegitimate influence from the upper levels of state power, but, as has been said today, we still have much to do in fighting corruption. Our economy, and therefore our entire social sphere, was dependent on foreign debt and foreign borrowing, and this meant that we were not independent and enabled others to interfere in our domestic affairs. We turned a blind eye to this situation, sometimes even pretending to like it, and we were unable to effectively protect our own interests in international affairs.

We still face many problems in other areas too. As has already been said, there is a great divide between the incomes of rich and poor in our country. We need to work towards fairer provision for people in their old age and for those who are unable to work. We still have much work to do in the areas of health, education, science, strengthening our defence capability and rural development. But the situation in these areas is improving. Most important is not the positive trends that have emerged, but the fact that the policies we are pursuing ensure a high economic growth rate and growing investment and incomes, and this creates the conditions that enable us to be fully confident about our ability to solve all the problems we face today, above all the social problems, and to do so with respect for human rights and liberties and in a free and democratic system.

Now, regarding the ideas and proposals put forward today.

Thank you once again for your offers. Though I was one of the initiators of United Russia’s founding, I, like the vast majority of people in our country, am not a member of any political party, and I would rather not change this status. I think it would be wrong to change the Constitution to suit one particular person, even if that person is someone I most certainly trust.

The proposal to head the Government is entirely realistic, but it is too soon to talk about this at the moment because at least two conditions would first need to be met. First, United Russia would have to win the State Duma election on December 2, and second, our voters would have to elect a decent, effective and modern-thinking President with whom it would be possible to work together. What we need to talk about today is the fact that your party can and should be an instrument for guaranteeing social stability and ensuring that the next parliament and the state power system in general can function effectively. Your party should initiate development and provide support for the executive authorities in carrying out the plans that have been made. This is all something that can and should be the subject of discussion.

It is therefore with gratitude that I accept your proposal to head the United Russia list. ",President,Vladimir Putin,http://en.kremlin.ru/events/president/transcripts/statements/24561,,OTHERS
China,17-06-2020 00:00,H.E. Xi Jinping,Defeating COVID-19 with Solidarity and Cooperation,"Your Excellency President Cyril Ramaphosa,
Your Excellency President Macky Sall,
Your Excellencies Heads of State and Government,
Your Excellency Moussa Faki Mahamat, Chairperson of the African Union Commission,
Your Excellency António Guterres, Secretary-General of the United Nations,
Your Excellency Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, Director-General of the World Health Organization,

At such a critical moment in the global fight against COVID-19, we are gathered together in this Extraordinary China-Africa Summit. Friends old and new are connected via video link to discuss our joint response to COVID-19 and to renew the fraternity between China and Africa. I thank President Ramaphosa and President Sall for joining me in initiating the Summit, and I appreciate the participation of all colleagues present. I also want to send my regards to other African leaders who are not able to be with us today.

The sudden onslaught of COVID-19 has taken a heavy toll on countries around the world, with the loss of several hundred thousand precious lives. Here, I suggest that we observe a moment of silence for those who have tragically passed away due to COVID-19 and express our condolences to their families.

- In the face of COVID-19, China and Africa have withstood the test of a severe challenge. The Chinese people have put up a fierce fight and made enormous sacrifice to bring the situation in China under control. Still, we remain mindful of the risk of a resurgence. In the same spirit, governments and peoples in Africa have put up a united front and, under the effective coordination by the African Union, have taken strong measures to effectively slow the spread of the virus. These are indeed hard-won results.

- In the face of COVID-19, China and Africa have offered mutual support and fought shoulder to shoulder with each other. China shall always remember the invaluable support Africa gave us at the height of our battle with the coronavirus. In return, when Africa was struck by the virus, China was the first to rush in with assistance and has since stood firm with the African people.

- In the face of COVID-19, China and Africa have enhanced solidarity and strengthened friendship and mutual trust. Let me reaffirm China's commitment to its longstanding friendship with Africa. No matter how the international landscape may evolve, China shall never waver in its determination to pursue greater solidarity and cooperation with Africa.

Colleagues,

COVID-19 is still affecting many parts of the world. Both China and Africa face the formidable task of combating the virus while stabilizing the economy and protecting people's livelihoods. We must always put our people and their lives front and center. We must mobilize necessary resources, stick together in collaboration, and do whatever it takes to protect people's lives and health and minimize the fallout of COVID-19.

First, we must stay committed to fighting COVID-19 together. China will continue to do whatever it can to support Africa's response to COVID-19. China will lose no time in following through on the measures I announced at the opening of the World Health Assembly, and continue to help African countries by providing supplies, sending expert teams, and facilitating Africa's procurement of medical supplies in China. China will start ahead of schedule the construction of the Africa CDC headquarters this year. China will work with Africa to fully deliver the health care initiative adopted at the FOCAC Beijing Summit, and speed up the construction of China-Africa Friendship Hospitals and the cooperation between paired-up Chinese and African hospitals. Together, we will build a China-Africa community of health for all. We pledge that once the development and deployment of COVID-19 vaccine is completed in China, African countries will be among the first to benefit.

Second, we must stay committed to enhancing China-Africa cooperation. To cushion the impact of COVID-19, it is important to strengthen Belt and Road cooperation and accelerate the follow-ups to the FOCAC Beijing Summit. Greater priority needs to be given to cooperation on public health, economic reopening, and people's livelihood.

Within the FOCAC framework, China will cancel the debt of relevant African countries in the form of interest-free government loans that are due to mature by the end of 2020. For those African countries that are hardest hit by the coronavirus and are under heavy financial stress, China will work with the global community to give them greater support, by such means as further extending the period of debt suspension, to help them tide over the current difficulty. We encourage Chinese financial institutions to respond to the G20's Debt Service Suspension Initiative (DSSI) and to hold friendly consultations with African countries according to market principles to work out arrangements for commercial loans with sovereign guarantees. China will work with other members of the G20 to implement the DSSI and, on that basis, urge the G20 to extend debt service suspension still further for countries concerned, including those in Africa.

China hopes that the international community, especially developed countries and multilateral financial institutions, will act more forcefully on debt relief and suspension for Africa. China will work with the UN, WHO and other partners to assist Africa's response to COVID-19, and do it in a way that respects the will of Africa.

To help Africa achieve sustainable development is what matters in the long run. China supports Africa in its effort to develop the African Continental Free Trade Area and to enhance connectivity and strengthen industrial and supply chains. China will explore broader cooperation with Africa in such new business forms as digital economy, smart city, clean energy, and 5G to boost Africa's development and revitalization.

Third, we must stay committed to upholding multilateralism. In the face of COVID-19, solidarity and cooperation is our most powerful weapon. China will work with Africa to uphold the UN-centered global governance system and support WHO in making greater contribution to the global COVID-19 response. We oppose politicization and stigmatization of COVID-19, and we oppose racial discrimination and ideological bias. We stand firm for equity and justice in the world.

Fourth, we must stay committed to taking China-Africa friendship forward. The world is undergoing profound changes unseen in a century. Given the new opportunities and challenges we face, closer cooperation between China and Africa is needed, more than ever. On my part, I will stay in close touch with all of you, my colleagues, to consolidate our friendship and mutual trust, support each other on issues involving our respective core interests, and advance the fundamental interests of China and Africa and, for that matter, of all developing countries. This way, we will be able to take the China-Africa comprehensive strategic and cooperative partnership to a greater height.

Colleagues,

At the FOCAC Beijing Summit, we agreed to work together to build an even stronger China-Africa community with a shared future. Today's Extraordinary China-Africa Summit on Solidarity against COVID-19 is our concrete step to deliver the commitment we made at the Beijing Summit and to do our part in the international cooperation against COVID-19. I am convinced that humanity will ultimately defeat the virus, and that the Chinese and African people are poised to embrace better days ahead.

Thank you.",President,Xi Jinping,https://www.fmprc.gov.cn/mfa_eng/wjdt_665385/zyjh_665391/t1789559.shtml,,INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS
China,01-04-2014 00:00,Xi Jinping,Speech at the College of Europe,"Your Majesties King Philippe and Queen Mathilde,
President Herman Van Rompuy,
Prime Minister Elio Di Rupo,
President Inigo Mendez de Vigo,
Rector Jorg Monar,
Diplomatic Envoys,
Faculty Members,
Students,
Ladies and Gentlemen,
Friends,

Good morning! It is a great pleasure for me to come to the College of Europe and meet with faculty members and students. First of all, my warm greetings and best wishes to you and all those in Europe who have shown interest in and support to the development of China.

In the Flemish language, Bruges means ""bridge"". A bridge not only makes life more convenient; it could also be a symbol of communication, understanding and friendship. I have come to Europe to build, together with our European friends, a bridge of friendship and cooperation across the Eurasian continent.

Before coming here, I visited a Volvo plant in Ghent together with King Philippe and Queen Mathilde. Volvo Cars Ghent, the largest car manufacturer in Belgium, has become a model of economic and technological cooperation between China, Belgium and Sweden. It has actually set up a bridge linking Chinese investment with European technology. What it leads to is mutual benefit and win-win cooperation.

The College of Europe was created after the end of World War II as a result of people's reflection of the war and their yearning for peace. Human history has far too often been haunted by the specter of war. Having suffered from the calamity of World War II, people in Europe began to think over about their past misery and started to unite, under the leadership of statesmen like Jean Monnet and Robert Schuman, in a joint pursuit for lasting peace and prosperity.

After more than half a century of development, the College today not only serves as an important think tank for the European Union. It is also seen as the cradle of political elites of Europe. In the words of Mr. Van Rompuy, the College has always been ""at the heart of European integration"" and is in itself an expression of the faith in Europe born ""out of the ruins of war"".

Faculty Members,

Students,

In 1949 when the College of Europe was established, the People's Republic of China was founded, heralding a new historical era in the development of the Chinese nation. Later in 1975, late Chinese premier Zhou Enlai and Sir Christopher Soames, acting on their assessment of the world situation then, decided that China and the European Economic Community should establish diplomatic relations. Today, China and the EU have a comprehensive strategic partnership. We have established dialogue and consultation mechanisms in over 60 areas. Our trade last year reached 559.1 billion US dollars. Over five million visits are exchanged each year. And about 300,000 of our students are studying overseas either in Europe or in China. The relationship between China and the EU has become one of the most important bilateral relationships in the world.

Having said that, we should not forget that there is still greater room for the growth of China-EU relations and the potential is yet to be fully tapped. To move our relationship forward, China needs to know more about Europe, and Europe needs to know more about China. For any country in the world, the past always holds the key to the present and the present is always rooted in the past. Only when we know where a country has come from, could we possibly understand why the country is what it is today, and only then could we realize in which direction it is heading.

So let me use this opportunity to describe to you what a country China is. I hope it will be helpful to you as you try to observe, understand and study China. Of course, a thorough account of the country would be too big a topic for today, so I will just focus on the following few features of China.

First, China has a time-honored civilization. Of the world's ancient civilizations, the Chinese civilization has continued uninterrupted to this day. In fact, it has spanned over 5,000 years. The Chinese characters, invented by our ancestors several millennia ago, are still used today. Over 2,000 years ago, there was an era of great intellectual accomplishments in China, which is referred to as ""the period of one hundred masters and schools of thought"". Great thinkers such as Laozi, Confucius and Mozi, to name just a few, explored a wide range of topics from the universe to the Earth, and from man's relations with nature to relations amongst human beings and to that between the individual and society. The extensive and profound schools of thought they established covered many important ideas, such as the moral injunction of fidelity to one's parents and brothers and to the monarch and friends, the sense of propriety, justice, integrity and honor, the emphasis on benevolence and kindness towards fellow human beings and the belief that man should be in harmony with nature, follow nature's course and unremittingly pursue self-renewal. These values and teachings still carry a profound impact on Chinese people's way of life today, underpinning the unique value system in the Chinese outlook of the world, of society and of life itself. And this unique and time-honored intellectual legacy has instilled a strong sense of national confidence in the Chinese people and nurtured a national spirit with patriotism at the very core.

Second, China has gone through many vicissitudes. For several thousand years before the industrial revolution, China had been leading the world in economic, technological and cultural development. However, feudal rulers of the 18th and 19th centuries closed the door of China in boastful ignorance and China was since left behind in the trend of development. The country was subdued to a semi-colonial and semi-feudal society. As a result of incessant foreign invasions thereafter, China experienced great social turmoil and its people had to lead a life of extreme destitution. Poverty prompted the call for change and people experiencing turmoil aspired for stability. After a hundred years of persistent and unyielding struggle, the Chinese people, sacrificing tens of millions of lives, ultimately took their destiny back into their own hands. Nevertheless, the memory of foreign invasion and bullying has never been erased from the minds of the Chinese people, and that explains why we cherish so dearly the life we lead today. The Chinese people want peace; we do not want war. This is the reason why China follows an independent foreign policy of peace. China is committed to non-interference in other countries' internal affairs, and China will not allow others to interfere in its own affairs. This is the position we have upheld in the past. It is what we will continue to uphold in the future.

Third, China is a socialist country with Chinese characteristics. In 1911, the revolution led by Dr. Sun Yat-sen overthrew the autocratic monarchy that had ruled China for several thousand years. But once the old system was gone, where China would go became the question. The Chinese people then started exploring long and hard for a path that would suit China's national conditions. They experimented with constitutional monarchy, imperial restoration, parliamentarism, multi-party system and presidential government, yet nothing really worked. Finally, China took on the path of socialism. Admittedly, in the process of building socialism, we have had successful experience and also made mistakes. We have even suffered serious setbacks. After the ""reform and opening-up"" was launched under the leadership of Mr. Deng Xiaoping, we have, acting in line with China's national conditions and the trend of the times, explored and blazed a trail of development and established socialism with Chinese characteristics. Our aim is to build a socialist market economy, democracy, an advanced culture, a harmonious society and a sound eco-system, uphold social equity and justice, promote all-round development of the people, pursue peaceful development, complete the building of a moderately prosperous society in all respects and eventually achieve modernization and ensure prosperity for all. The uniqueness of China's cultural tradition, history and circumstances determines that China needs to follow a development path that suits its own reality. In fact, we have found such a path and achieved success along this path.

Fourth, China is the world's biggest developing country. China has made historic progress in development. It is now the second largest economy in the world. It has achieved in several decades what took developed countries several centuries to achieve. This is, without doubt, a proud achievement for a country whose population exceeds 1.3 billion. In the meantime, we are clearly aware that the large size of the Chinese economy, when divided by 1.3 billion, sends China to around the 80th place in terms of per capita GDP. In China, over 74 million people rely on basic living allowances; each year, more than 10 million urban people would join the job market and several hundred million rural people need to be transferred to non-agricultural jobs and settle down in urban areas; more than 85 million people are with disabilities; and more than 200 million people are still living under the poverty line set by the World Bank, and that is roughly the population of France, Germany and the UK combined. In the 40-day-long season of the last Chinese New Year, China's airlines, railroads and highways transported 3.6 billion passengers, which means 90 million people were on the move each day. Therefore, to make the lives of the 1.3 billion Chinese people more comfortable requires still arduous efforts for years to come. Economic development remains the top priority for China, and we still need to work on that basis to achieve social progress in all areas.

Fifth, China is a country undergoing profound changes. Our ancestors taught us that ""as heaven maintains vigor through movement, a gentleman should constantly strive for self-perfection"", and that ""if one can make things better for one day, he should make them better every day"". Being faced with fierce international competition is like sailing against the current. One either forges ahead or falls behind. Reform, which was first forced upon us by problems, goes deeper in addressing the problems. We know keenly that reform and opening-up is an ongoing process that will never stop. China's reform has entered a deep water zone, where problems crying to be resolved are all difficult ones. What we need is the courage to move the reform forward. To use a Chinese saying, we must ""get ready to go into the mountain, being fully aware that there may be tigers to encounter"". The principle we have laid down for reform is to act with courage while moving forward with steady steps. As we say in China, he who wants to accomplish a big and difficult undertaking should start with easier things first and make sure that all details are attended to. With the deepening of reform, China will continue to undergo profound changes. I believe that our efforts of deepening reform comprehensively will not only provide strong momentum for China's modernization drive, but also bring new development opportunities to the world.

To observe and understand China properly, one needs to bear in mind both China's past and present and draw reference from both China's accomplishments and the Chinese way of thinking. The 5,000-year-long Chinese civilization, the 170-year struggle by the Chinese people since modern times, the 90-year-plus journey of the Communist Party of China, the 60-year-plus development of the People's Republic and the 30-year-plus reform and opening-up should all be taken into account. They each make an integral part of China's history, and none should be taken out of the historical context. One can hardly understand China well without a proper understanding of China's history, culture, the Chinese people's way of thinking and the profound changes taking place in China today.

The world's development is multi-dimensional, and its history is never a linear movement. China cannot copy the political system or development model of other countries, because it would not fit us and it might even lead to catastrophic consequences. The Chinese people, over 2,000 year ago, had come to understand this from a simple fact that the tasty orange, grown in southern China, would turn sour once it is grown in the north. The leaves may look the same, but the fruits taste quite different, because the north means different location and different climate.

A French writer once said that friends are transparent to friends because they exchange life. I hope what I just shared with you could draw for you a more transparent picture of China. I also sincerely hope that the College of Europe will produce a large number of talents who know and understand China well so as to provide a constant source of talent and intellectual support for the growth of China-Europe relations.

Faculty Members,

Students,

China and Europe may seem far apart geographically, but we are in fact in the same time and the same space. I even feel that we are close to each other, as if in the same neighborhood. Both China and Europe are in a crucial stage of development and facing unprecedented opportunities and challenges. As I just said, we hope to work with our European friends to build a bridge of friendship and cooperation across the Eurasian continent. For that, we need to build four bridges for peace, growth, reform and progress of civilization, so that the China-EU comprehensive strategic partnership will take on even greater global significance.

We need to build a bridge of peace and stability linking the two strong forces of China and the EU. China and the EU take up one tenth of the total area on Earth and one fourth of the world's population. Together, we take three permanent seats on the Security Council of the United Nations. We all need peace, multilateralism and dialogue, instead of war, unilateralism and confrontation. We need to enhance communication and coordination on global issues and play a key role in safeguarding world peace and stability. Civilization and culture can spread, so can peace and development. China stands ready to work with the EU to let the sunlight of peace drive away the shadow of war and the bonfire of prosperity warm up the global economy in the cold early spring, and enable the whole mankind to embark on the path of peaceful development and win-win cooperation.

We need to build a bridge of growth and prosperity linking the two big markets of China and the EU. China and the EU are the two most important major economies in the world with our combined economy accounting for one third of the global economy. We must uphold open market, speed up negotiations on the investment agreement, actively explore the possibility of a free trade area, and strive to achieve the ambitious goal of bringing two-way trade to one trillion US dollars by 2020. We should also study how to dovetail China-EU cooperation with the initiative of developing the Silk Road economic belt so as to integrate the markets of Asia and Europe, energize the people, businesses, capital and technologies of Asia and Europe, and make China and the EU the twin engines for global economic growth.

We need to build a bridge of reform and progress linking the reform processes in China and the EU. Both China and the EU are pursuing reforms that are unprecedented in human history, and both are sailing uncharted waters. We may enhance dialogue and cooperation on macro-economy, public policy, regional development, rural development, social welfare and other fields. We need to respect each other's path of reform and draw upon each other's reform experience. And we need to promote world development and progress through our reform efforts.

We need to build a bridge of common cultural prosperity linking the two major civilizations of China and Europe. China represents in an important way the Eastern civilization, while Europe is the birthplace of the Western civilization. The Chinese people are fond of tea and the Belgians love beer. To me, the moderate tea drinker and the passionate beer lover represent two ways of understanding life and knowing the world, and I find them equally rewarding. When good friends get together, they may want to drink to their heart's content to show their friendship. They may also choose to sit down quietly and drink tea while chatting about their life. In China, we value the idea of preserving ""harmony without uniformity"", and here in the EU people stress the need to be ""united in diversity"". Let us work together for all flowers of human civilizations to blossom together.

In spite of changes in the international landscape, China has always supported European integration and a bigger role in international affairs by a united, stable and prosperous EU. China will soon release its second EU policy paper to reiterate the high importance it places on the EU and on its relations with the EU. Last year, China and the EU jointly formulated the Strategic Agenda 2020 for China-EU Cooperation, setting out a host of ambitious goals for China-EU cooperation in nearly 100 areas. The two sides should work in concert to turn the blueprint into reality at an early date and strive for greater progress in China-EU relations in the coming decade.

Faculty Members,

Students,

The College of Europe has, in recent years, placed increasing importance on China. It has opened courses on Europe-China relations. It is also busy preparing for the launch of a Europe-China research center devoted to studies of Europe-China relations. China has decided to work with the College of Europe to build a ""Chinese Library"", the first of its kind in an EU member country, and will provide, for the purpose of academic research, 10,000 books, videos and films on Chinese history, culture and the achievements China has made in various fields.

As we Chinese believe, one needs to not only read 10,000 books, but also travel 10,000 miles to know the world around us. I suggest that you go to China more often to see for yourselves what China is like. What you hear from others might be false, but what you see with your own eyes is real. China intends to work with the EU to bring the number of students exchanged between the two sides to 300,000 each year by 2020.

Young people are always energetic and full of dreams. They are the future of China, Europe and, indeed, of the world. I hope that Chinese and European students will perceive the world with equality, respect and love and treat different civilizations with appreciation, inclusiveness and the spirit of mutual learning. This way, you will promote mutual understanding and knowledge among the people of China, Europe and other parts of the world, and with your youthful energy and hard work, make our planet a better place to live in.

Thank you.",President,Xi Jinping,https://www.fmprc.gov.cn/mfa_eng/wjdt_665385/zyjh_665391/t1144230.shtml,,DEVELOPMENT
China,18-11-2015 00:00,Xi Jinping,The Leading Role of the Asia-Pacific In Meeting Global Economic Challenges,"Chairman Tony Tan Caktiong,
Business leaders from the Asia-Pacific,
Ladies and Gentlemen,
Friends,

Good morning! I am delighted to meet all of you again. Last November, we gathered in Beijing to explore the ways and means to advance Asia-Pacific economic cooperation. That meeting is still fresh in my memory.

APEC is not only the most important economic and trade forum in our region, but also the multilateral cooperation platform in which Asia-Pacific business communities are most deeply involved. We live in the age of transformation. Both political leaders and entrepreneurs need to focus on the present while keeping an eye on the future in order to stay on top of global trends and adapt to the changing world.

Two days ago, I attended the G20 Summit in Antalya, where world leaders had in-depth discussions on the major challenges facing global economy and the ways to deal with them. The basic view we came to share is that the global economy, though on a course of slow recovery, is not yet solidly based and still fraught with considerable destabilizing factors and uncertainties. Many countries expressed worries that the divergence of the monetary policies of the advanced economies may lead to erratic capital flows, high global indebtedness and low market confidence. All this, coupled with fluctuations in the global financial and commodities markets, will exert a greater impact on emerging markets and developing countries in general. Global growth continues to fall short of expectations with sliding trend of potential growth rates, and international trade and investment remain weak. The world economy might encounter simultaneous slowdown of multiple growth engines and get stuck in stagnation. It will probably take a long and tortuous process before the global economy becomes healthy again.

Against the backdrop of multiple challenges in the world economy, the Asia-Pacific economy is also confronted with many immediate and potential difficulties and risks. How to keep the Asia-Pacific economy on the right track? How to find new growth areas and strengthen the Asia-Pacific's status as a growth engine? These questions merit close attention and serious exploration.

Facing the dangerous rapids and shoals in the world economy, we must steer the giant ship of the Asia-Pacific in the right direction. All economies in the region must act in a responsible manner and work in unison to promote global growth.

First, we must press ahead with reform and innovation. To address the deep-seated problems in the world economy, monetary stimulus alone is not enough. We must commit ourselves to even greater efforts to advance economic structural reform so as to better adapt supply to the changing pattern of demand. This is an area where the Asia-Pacific should take the lead by adopting new approach, model and pathway of development. Efforts should also be made to expedite industrial upgrading so that science and technology innovation will bring about new products, management and business models, move Asia-Pacific economies up in the global supply chain and enable us to jointly build and benefit from a coordinated, open and inclusive global value chain. While developed economies need to be more forthcoming about sharing best practices and transferring technologies, developing economies should explore more boldly, increase input and try to catch up more quickly. We need to leverage the role of APEC as a policy platform and an ""incubator"" for strengthened cooperation in such areas as Internet economy, blue economy, green economy and urbanization, with a view to improving the region's capacity for independent innovation.

Second, we must build an open economy. Over the years, the Asia-Pacific has pursued greater openness, integration and development and found a unique path of dynamic regional economic cooperation, setting a good example of integration endeavor involving economies vastly different in level of development. Last year, APEC economic leaders took a historic step forward by kicking off in Beijing the Free Trade Area of the Asia-Pacific (FTAAP) process. With various new regional free trade arrangements cropping up, worries about fragmentation are on the increase. We need to accelerate the realization of FTAAP and take regional economic integration forward. We need to encourage equal-footed participation and extensive consultation, and make free trade arrangements open and inclusive to the extent possible with a view to enhancing economic openness in our region and upholding the multilateral trading regime. We must commit ourselves to win-win cooperation, oppose protectionism and promote fair competition.

Third, we must implement the Sustainable Development Agenda. An ancient Chinese philosopher said, ""The key to running a country is to make its people better-off."" The ultimate aim of development is to serve the people by bringing more and more fruits of development to all our people. Not long ago, the UN Sustainable Development Summit adopted the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. At the G20 Summit in Antalya, I called on the members to take actions and implement the Sustainable Development Agenda. To this end, we need to incorporate the Sustainable Development Agenda into our respective national development strategies and ensure its effective implementation. It is important that we establish an all-round partnership on development, mobilizing the government, enterprises and social resources in a concerted effort of implementation. It is necessary to promote inclusive and harmonious development, meet the targets of the Sustainable Development Agenda as soon as possible and, in so doing, create more room for improved quality and efficiency of development and ensure the tasks are mutually reinforcing.

Fourth, we must promote connectivity. Connectivity will make the Asia-Pacific economy more vibrant, which will in turn increase potential in economic and social development. It focuses on infrastructure, rules and institutions and personnel movement, and calls for progress in policy communication, infrastructure linkage, trade flow, financing arrangements and friendly exchanges between the people. Through connectivity efforts, countries can align their national development strategies, plans and programs, and identify priority areas and projects. Through connectivity efforts, regions and countries can trade in production factors, complement each other's industrial advantages and production capacity, and learn from each other's development experience. The supply chain, industry chain and value chain of the Asia-Pacific need to be improved so as to achieve economy of scale and combined effects in the interest of overall invigoration of the Asia-Pacific economy. Last year, we adopted in Beijing the APEC Connectivity Blueprint, which needs to be earnestly followed through for tangible results.

""Even the shortest journey can't be finished without taking the first step. Even the most trivial task can't be completed without taking actions."" No blueprint will just automatically come true. When it comes to realizing the goals we set, all APEC members need to work hand in hand. We must step up policy dialogue and coordination and use APEC as a platform to create synergy. We must focus on development, spare no effort in fostering an environment of peace conducive to development and never allow anything to disrupt the Asia-Pacific development process. We must adhere to the concept of win-win cooperation and community of shared future, cooperating while competing, and achieving common development through cooperation. We must recognize diversity in development path, respect each other's development paths chosen in light of our specific conditions, and resolve differences through dialogue and consultation. I am confident that the vast Pacific Ocean will become a bridge of cooperation, a bond of friendship and a place we call our common home.

Ladies and Gentlemen,
Friends,

As the world's second largest economy, China's economy is very much in the international spotlight. With global growth slowing down, China is working vigorously to overcome difficulties and meet challenges by strengthening macro-regulation and effectively advancing reforms. Though our monthly and quarterly economic indicators have fluctuated a bit, the overall economy has operated within the reasonable range and maintained steady and fairly rapid growth. In the first three quarters, China's economy grew by 6.9%, contributing approximately 30% to global growth. Such a growth rate was achieved by a big economy of over 10 trillion dollars and in the process of economic restructuring and transformation. This is indeed a hard-won result.

In general, China's positive economic fundamentals and long-term trajectory remain unchanged. What also remain unchanged are the basic fact that China's economy possesses strong resilience, great potential and ample room for maneuver; the strong support and conditions favorable for continued growth; and the forward movement of the country's economic restructuring and upgrading. On the other hand, China's economy is still grappling with a complicated internal and external environment, considerable downward pressure and the throes of deep reforms. The opportunities are unprecedented, but so are the challenges.

Recently, the fifth plenum of the 18th CPC Central Committee adopted the proposal for the 13th five-year plan on economic and social development, putting forth the concept of innovative, coordinated, green, open and shared development, and proposing a series of major reforms in next five years which is the final stage of our quest for a society of initial prosperity in all respects. We will step up reform and innovation, accelerate the shift of growth model and economic restructuring, earnestly address the difficult issues in development, cultivate new drivers and new edges for development, and create more fresh opportunities for development.

- We will pay still more attention to efficiency and quality. We will work hard to shift the growth model, from expanding scale to improving structure, from factor driven to innovation driven, and from depending mainly on investment and export to relying on coordinated increase in consumption, investment and export. We will work for a deeper convergence of IT application and industrialization, a sound interaction of industrialization and urbanization, and the mutual reinforcement of urbanization and agricultural modernization. All this, we can say for sure, will bring forth new development drivers and greater room for China's growth.

- We will pay still more attention to innovation. While vigorously implementing the strategy of an innovation-driven development, we will lay greater emphasis on innovation and take full advantage of its multiplier effect in galvanizing growth. We will do away with institutional obstacles, and let the market be the decisive force in allocating innovation resources and the enterprises the key players in technological innovation.

- We will pay still more attention to equity and justice. Always bearing in mind the most direct and immediate interest of the people, we will build a new development mechanism that features equity, justice, joint efforts and sharing of benefits by all. In this way, we can make economic development more inclusive. We will concentrate our efforts on some tough issues. For example, in the next five years, all the remaining 70 million-plus rural people living in poverty by existing Chinese standard and all the designated poor counties will be lifted out of poverty, which will be an important part of our efforts to implement the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.

- We will pay still more attention to green development. We will make ecological progress part and parcel of the entire process of our economic and social development with a view to achieving sustainable development. We will build up a strong capacity to adapt to climate change, stick to our basic state policy of resource conservation and environment protection, and turn China into a beautiful country with blue sky, green land and clear water.

- We will pay still more attention to opening to the outside world. While pushing for a more proactive strategy of opening-up, we will build a new system of open economy with an even higher level of openness. We will accelerate efforts to build high-standard FTAs. Talks are near conclusion on an upgraded China-ASEAN FTA, which is set to make a positive impact. China's bilateral FTAs with Australia and the ROK are both expected to come into force by the end of this year, giving a fresh boost to economic growth. China will also work with relevant parties to finish at an early date negotiations on the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) while accelerating talks on a China-Japan-ROK FTA. We will step up reforms of the foreign investors management system, substantially cut back on market access restrictions for foreign investment, improve IPR protection and foster an open, transparent, fair and highly efficient market environment.

Here I would like to reiterate that China's policy on welcoming foreign investment will not change, nor will its protection of the legitimate rights and interests of foreign-invested enterprises or its commitment to provide better services for them. China's door to the outside world will forever stay open.

Ladies and Gentlemen,
Friends,

China is a member of the Asia-Pacific family. We began our development here and we owe our development to the Asia-Pacific. We will continue to anchor ourselves here and deliver benefits to the region. Two years ago, I proposed the initiative of jointly building the Silk Road Economic Belt and the 21st Century Maritime Silk Road. The initiative has since received warm responses from and active participation by over 60 countries and international organizations. The ""Belt and Road"" Initiative is gaining momentum and achieving some initial results.

Committed to open regionalism, China has signed cooperation agreements with many countries in and beyond the region to harmonize policies and development strategies and facilitate freer and more orderly flow of economic factors, more efficient allocation of resources and deeper integration of the markets. Through implementing the ""Belt and Road"" Initiative, we will go for even broader, deeper and more sophisticated cooperation at the regional level and jointly foster a regional framework of open, inclusive, balanced and mutually beneficial cooperation.

At present, some key economic corridors and a large number of major multilateral and bilateral projects are making steady progress. China has established and put into operation the Silk Road Fund, and is now working actively with more than 50 countries to prepare the launching of the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB), a new type of investment and financing institution that is expected to be officially up and running by the end of this year. It will provide financing support for a number of important projects. What is more, we will gradually put in place new cooperation platforms in such priority areas as economy and trade, energy, investment, people-to-people and cultural exchanges, and work to reinvigorate the existing bilateral and multilateral mechanisms.

Ladies and Gentlemen,
Friends,

Asia-Pacific business communities represent a principal force for development in the region and a pioneer in innovation and entrepreneurship. Having made significant contributions to regional prosperity and development, you carry an important mission to shape the region's future. We welcome the continued participation of Asia-Pacific business communities in China's development in which you can share our opportunities and potential benefits. We also look forward to your greater contribution to the region's long-term economic development and to the strong, sustainable and balanced growth of the world economy.

Next September, China will host the 11th G20 Summit in the city of Hangzhou. I welcome the active participation of Asia-Pacific business communities in the events in China, where all can share their ideas and help build a stronger world economy.

Thank you. ",President,Xi Jinping,https://www.fmprc.gov.cn/mfa_eng/wjdt_665385/zyjh_665391/t1316082.shtml,,DEVELOPMENT
China,12-12-2020 00:00,H.E. Xi Jinping,Building on Past Achievements and Launching a New Journey for Global Climate Actions,"Your Excellency Secretary-General António Guterres,
Dear Colleagues,

It gives me great pleasure to join you in this Climate Ambition Summit. Five years ago, world leaders showed utmost political resolve and wisdom and adopted the Paris Agreement on climate change. Since then, the implementation of the Paris Agreement has received extensive international support and participation. At present, the international landscape is evolving more rapidly and COVID-19 is triggering deep reflections on the relationship between man and nature. The future of global climate governance is drawing greater attention. In this context, I wish to make three proposals:

First, we need to close ranks and make new advances in climate governance that features cooperation and win-win. In meeting the climate challenge, no one can be aloof and unilateralism will get us nowhere. Only by upholding multilateralism, unity and cooperation can we deliver shared benefits and win-win for all nations. China welcomes all countries' support for the Paris Agreement and their greater contribution to tackling climate change.

Second, we need to raise ambition and foster a new architecture of climate governance where every party does its part. Following the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities, all countries need to maximize actions in light of their respective national circumstances and capabilities. At the same time, developed countries need to scale up support for developing countries in financing, technology and capacity building.

Third, we need to boost confidence and pursue a new approach to climate governance that highlights green recovery. Mountains and rivers green are mountains of silver and gold. It is important to encourage green, low-carbon ways of life and production, and seek development opportunities and impetus from green development.

China has made important contributions to adopting the Paris Agreement and has made active efforts toward implementing it. I announced in September that China would scale up its nationally determined contributions and adopt more vigorous policies and measures. We aim to peak carbon dioxide emissions before 2030 and achieve carbon neutrality before 2060.

Today, I wish to announce some further commitments for 2030: China will lower its carbon dioxide emissions per unit of GDP by over 65 percent from the 2005 level, increase the share of non-fossil fuels in primary energy consumption to around 25 percent, increase the forest stock volume by 6 billion cubic meters from the 2005 level, and bring its total installed capacity of wind and solar power to over 1.2 billion kilowatts.

China always honors its commitments. Guided by our new development philosophy, we will promote greener economic and social development in all respects while pursuing high-quality development. We will take solid steps to implement the targets just announced, and contribute even more to tackling the global climate challenge.

Colleagues,

As a Chinese poem reads, ""Heaven does not speak and it alternates the four seasons; Earth does not speak and it nurtures all things."" Earth is our only and shared home. Let us build on past achievements, work together to make steady progress in implementing the Paris Agreement, and launch a new journey for global climate actions.

Thank you.",President,Xi Jinping,https://www.fmprc.gov.cn/mfa_eng/wjdt_665385/zyjh_665391/t1839779.shtml,,INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS
Russia,14-03-2016,Vladimir Putin,State Council Presidium meeting on road safety,"Good afternoon, colleagues.

Improving road safety is the main item on our agenda today. The big issue here is to save lives, the lives of thousands of our fellow citizens. We all understand that this is an absolutely fundamental task for state policy. Let me add that the road safety level has a direct impact on stable socioeconomic development and the effective operation of Russia’s entire transport infrastructure.

We discussed this issue in detail at an earlier State Council Presidium meeting, back in 2005, a long time ago. That meeting resulted in needed amendments to the laws and changes to the road code. It also led to the approval and implementation of the 2006–2012 federal targeted programme in this area.

Particular emphasis was put on repairing and reconstructing roads and motorways and generally improving the entire road infrastructure. We began using new traffic logistics technology, improved organisation of medical aid at the scene of traffic accidents, and also put in place better monitoring of road safety violations and faster response to such incidents.

Over these last years, the number of road accidents has dropped by 11.8 percent and social and transport risks are now considerably lower. At the same time, the number of cars on the roads has increased around the country and we now have 300 cars on average per 1,000 people. The number of cars will continue to grow, of course, and this creates an objective challenge for everyone using the roads and for the people responsible for organising traffic.

I want to stress that just because we see more and more cars on the road, we cannot and should not make the excuse that accidents and their tragic consequences are therefore inevitable. On the contrary, we must achieve a dramatic reduction in the number of people killed and injured in road accidents.

I remind you that over the last decade, more than 3 million people have been injured in road accidents and 350,000 people have been killed on the roads over this time. This is a terrible figure, equivalent to the population of a sizeable city. These are terrible and senseless losses that we could avoid. The vast majority of these tragedies were the fault of drivers themselves: aggression and lack of respect for people on the roads is usually the cause of the serious accidents.

The key task is therefore to foster a driving culture grounded in strict respect for the road rules, competent behaviour and goodwill on the roads, and awareness of our responsibility for our own lives, the lives of our loved ones, and the safety of all road users.

This kind of culture cannot be developed overnight, of course, and it must proceed in parallel with tougher penalties for road safety violations. We see in practice that these kinds of measures have helped solve the problem of getting people to wear seat belts, for example, and installing child seats, or restraining devices, as the specialists call them, in cars.

This and other solutions have helped to halve the number of people killed on our urban roads, but the number of road accident victims still remains unjustifiably high nevertheless.

Last May, I instructed the Government to take additional measures to reduce road accident mortality. Last August, the Government approved an action plan that included provisions for submitting 13 draft laws to the State Duma. The deadlines have all come and gone, and only one of these draft laws is actually before the State Duma now; the others are still going through the approvals process in the Government. I ask the heads of the ministries and agencies responsible for drafting these documents to take personal responsibility for bringing them before the State Duma so that they can be passed during the spring session this year, as was planned. I repeat that reducing the death toll from road accidents is our main task.

Many people are still getting killed at pedestrian crossings. This figure came to more than 1,000 people last year. I think we should impose tougher penalties on drivers for breaking the rules at pedestrian crossings. In 2015, the number of accidents at pedestrian crossings increased by 2 percent compared to 2014. There were 19,779 violations in total, and 1,233 people were killed.

Crossing into the oncoming lane remains the most common type of serious violation. Penalties that include losing one’s licence do not stop reckless drivers, and their irresponsible driving kills innocent people. I think the Government should draw up a comprehensive and systematic action plan to resolve this problem. Greater use should be made of preventive measures, including by the traffic police. They should not just note the violations, but should also be engaged in practical organisation of safe traffic on the roads.

Efforts to prevent road accidents and educate people should involve in broad fashion the media and the public and make use of all the possibilities offered by the Internet. This is particularly effective at the regional and municipal level. Here, at this State Council Presidium meeting, we could formulate specific recommendations for the regions on closer cooperation with the media and with civil society organisations.

At the exhibition just before, the deputy mayor of Moscow put forward a request that has come more often of late from a number of regions. This concerns the matter of transferring to the regions the power to impose and collect fines for traffic violations. This is something we could consider, given that the regional and municipal authorities are largely responsible for work in this area. Some regions are ready to carry out programmes to install devices to catch speed violations on federal motorways. The fines collected would go into the regional road funds.

I think this would be useful for the regions and the federal authorities. Of course, we would need to discuss in detail the criteria for transfer of these powers with the Government and the regional heads.

Colleagues, we all understand that road safety is a complex issue and the authorities at every level, relevant agencies and economic actors all have an important part to play. Clearly, we need effective coordination of work between all of the different organisations. We see what lack of coordination leads to, including in the accidents that occur because of road problems, cited as a cause for one in three accidents on our roads. Around four percent of road accidents happen regularly at roadwork sites, for example. 20 people were killed last year and 113 were injured all because there is still no regulation making it a requirement to equip potentially dangerous stretches of road accordingly. Local authorities point the finger at the road repair services, and the repair people lay the blame on the road safety inspectors, and meanwhile, we make no progress in resolving this obvious problem.

As you know, there is no shortage of such issues. We all know the problem with road quality – this goes without saying and is a major issue of its own and related to financing problems. But these issues concerning roadwork organisation are things that we can resolve.

In this respect, the State Council’s working group proposes that the Government decide exactly which federal agencies are responsible for organising traffic and road safety. We will discuss these proposals in detail today.

The time has come for legal regulation of transport development, taking into account the need to ensure road safety and rapid and effective management. Each regional or local project in this area should be part of a common coordinated system for the country’s main transport networks, and the standards for new construction and repairs to existing roads and road infrastructure facilities should take into account all safety aspects.

Let me say a few words about some of the main tasks. First, we need to make broader use of insurance. This is something that should be part of training for drivers. The insurance culture should be part of the set of skills they learn as drivers and should foster their sense of personal responsibility. This is also essential for them to protect their own interests and for ensuring safety on our roads.

To get rid of excessive inconvenience and formalities, we should implement measures that allow people to register accidents without having to have the police present (this is the sense of the proposal from the Moscow City Hall). Of course, this would be possible only in cases where accidents involve material damage only. Not all road users are ready for this kind of independent action yet, but this is the way of the future and these principles should become as much second nature for drivers as is having car insurance.

I therefore ask the Bank of Russia and the insurance companies to take effective measures to prevent the spread of fake insurance policies. This has become a mass-scale problem of late and not only causes losses for ordinary people but also damages the insurance business’ reputation.

Teaching children road safety rules is another important task. I saw a demonstration just before of how this work is organised in Yaroslavl Region. I want to thank the Governor and everyone working on this, including school principals, who make space and time available at their schools for work with school and kindergarten pupils. But we need special programmes to teach children road safety in our schools and we need centres for preventing road injuries among children. This is a common task for the federal and regional authorities and also for the business community, particularly the insurance business, which can make a solid financial contribution to organising road safety programmes.

The next main area is organising swift medical aid for those injured in road accidents. As I said, much progress has been made in this area, including developing the system of specialised medical institutions.

Last year, ERA-GLONASS began operation. The state automated information system of emergency response to accidents sends the signal about road accidents to the relevant services. We are now producing vehicles fitted with this system’s terminals and this makes it possible to save accident victims’ lives.

Unfortunately, the ERA-GLONASS device has not been installed en masse in cars. I think we all realise how important this issue is, especially the car manufacturers, who we hope will get actively involved in this work. Overall, we need to do everything we can to ensure that all of the aid services respond without failure to all signals about road accidents.

Colleagues, there are many other issues that we also need to discuss. I hope that you will make a comprehensive examination of all of the issues in your presentations today.

Let’s begin our work.

<…>

Colleagues, let’s sum up the discussions here.

I want to thank the State Council working group for preparing this vitally important subject and Svetlana Orlova [head of the State Council road safety working group and Governor of Vladimir Region] for heading this work.

In conclusion, I want to say that I get the impression that we take this very serious problem rather lightly and look at it superficially, as a simple everyday banality. Our people’s prosperity is not growing as fast as we would like, of course, and our people certainly deserve more and better, but at the same time, as far as personal transport goes, the number of cars is growing fast, and the quality and unfortunately, the extensiveness of our road network lags behind this growth in the number of cars on the road.

As I said in my opening remarks, we should have made a timely response to this situation and taken the appropriate measures, but we did not do this, and now we have these huge losses – 30,000–35,000 people a year killed on our roads. This is a nightmare.

But all of these problems can be resolved if we work purposefully and with persistence. Of course this involves a whole range of issues: financing, administrative regulation, improving the laws, education, and healthcare aspects. This is all part of the federal, regional and local authorities’ direct responsibilities.

We examined practically every aspect of this issue today. I hope that what we agreed on and what we heard in the discussions will be implemented in practice. But if we really want to resolve this extremely important issue, we cannot take piecemeal action from one meeting to another, but must make an ongoing effort and put this work at the centre of the federal, regional and local authorities’ attention, and the public’s attention too, of course. I ask you all to make this united and responsible effort.

Thank you.",President,Vladimir Putin,http://en.kremlin.ru/events/president/transcripts/statements/51506,,DEVELOPMENT
USA,13-05-2014,Barack Obama,"
Remarks by the President at Law Enforcement Briefing on Immigration","Thank you, everybody.  (Applause.)  Have a seat.  Have a seat.  Well, it's wonderful to see all of you.  Some of you I've had the chance to get to know working on law enforcement issues and criminal justice issues.  But I cannot thank you enough for participating today on an issue that I think is important to our economic future, to our cultural future, to our standing in the world and to our safety and security, and that's the issue of immigration.

I’m here with some of the leaders of America’s law enforcement agencies who recognize that fixing a broken immigration system isn’t just the right thing to do -- it’s also the right thing to do for safety and security in communities all across America. 

The immigration system that we have right now makes it harder, not easier, for law enforcement agencies to do their jobs.  It makes it harder for law enforcement to know when dangerous people cross our borders.  It makes it harder for business owners who play by the rules to compete when they’re undercut by those who would exploit workers in a shadow economy. And it makes it harder for law enforcement to do their jobs when large segments of the community are afraid to report crimes or serve as witnesses because they fear the consequences for themselves or their families. 

This system is not fair.  It’s not fair to workers; it's not fair to businesses who are trying to do the right thing; it’s not fair to law enforcement agencies that are already stretched thin.

Now, the good news is the Senate has already passed a bill with a wide, bipartisan majority that would go a long way towards fixing a broken system.  It would strengthen our borders even further.  And I'm sure Jeh has talked to you about the work that's been done over the last five years -- we have put unprecedented resources at the borders, and you’ve seen the results.  We have fewer folks coming in than ever before.  And the personnel that is arrayed along our borders is well beyond anything that we saw five years ago, 10 years ago, 20 years ago. So we take border enforcement seriously. 

But what this reform package would also do is create a firm but fair pathway to earned citizenship for those who live in the shadows -- and as a consequence, would give law enforcement a better idea of who’s in the country.  It would also help build trust between local communities and law enforcement and immigrant communities.  It would undermine criminal enterprises that prey on undocumented immigrants.  And it would allow law enforcement to focus on its primary mission, which is keeping our communities safe.

And these are some of the reasons why a broad, bipartisan coalition -- including law enforcement agencies like the ones who are represented today -- is pushing Congress to go ahead and get the job done, get us over the finish line and do it this year. 

I hope all of you keep it up because it’s making a difference.  A number of Republicans are realizing that blocking immigration reform is not an option, and that's the good news.  And most Americans, the majority of Americans, know this is the right thing to do.  Public opinion is on our side on this.  Unfortunately, we've got a handful of House Republicans right now who are blocking going ahead and letting legislation get to the floor. 

To their credit, I think Speaker Boehner and some of the other leaders there do believe that immigration reform is the right thing, but they’ve got to have a political space that allows them to go ahead and get it through their caucus and get it done.  I've said to them, if they’ve got ideas I'm happy to talk to them.  We're not hell-bent on making sure that every letter of what’s in the Senate bill is exactly what ultimately lands on my desk for signature, but there are some core principles that we've got to get done.  We've got to have stronger border security.  We've got to make sure that we are dealing with companies that are not doing the right thing by workers.  We've got to make sure that we've got an improved legal immigration system, because a lot of folks are getting pushed into the illegal system because the waits are so long through the legal process.  And we've got to make sure that there’s a way for people to earn some pathway to citizenship.

And keep in mind, some of these statistics you may have already heard -- it's estimated that over 80 percent of the folks who are here on an undocumented basis have been here 10 years or longer.  These are folks who are woven into the fabrics of our communities.  Their kids are going to school with our kids.  Most of them are not making trouble; most of them are not causing crimes.  And yet, we put them in this tenuous position and it creates a situation in which your personnel, who have got to go after gang-bangers and need to be going after violent criminals and deal with the whole range of challenges, and who have to cooperate with DHS around our counterterrorism activities -- you’ve got to spend time dealing with somebody who is not causing any other trouble other than the fact that they were trying to make a living for their families.  That's just not a good use of our resources.  It's not smart.  It doesn’t make sense. 

So I know I'm preaching to the choir here.  You wouldn't be here if you didn’t agree with us that this is time for us to go ahead and get moving.  But I just want all of you to know your voices, particularly over the next couple of months, are going to be critical.  I think people have come to expect that I'm in favor of comprehensive immigration reform.  I think that people anticipate that the Congressional Hispanic Caucus is going to be in favor of comprehensive immigration reform.  I think people understand that there are a lot of agricultural enterprises that know how important their immigrant workers are to them.  But it's more important in some ways to get over the hump when they hear from unexpected voices. 

I think the evangelical Christian community has shown itself to be foursquare behind immigration reform, and that's a powerful voice.  I think portions of the business community that people may not anticipate know that this is the key to our economic future.  It would lower our deficits; it would grow our economy; it would bring in some of the most skilled people around the world.  We want them to continue to come here.  That's part of our competitive advantage relative to the rest of the world.  Our population is not aging the way some other populations are because it's constantly replenished with folks who are go-getters.  And hearing from law enforcement is important and I think it lends this overall effort great credibility.

So I just want to say thank you to all of you.  But we've got this narrow window.  The closer we get to the midterm elections the harder it is to get things done around here.  Now, I know it's hard to believe that things could get harder -- (laughter) -- that this place could get a little more dysfunctional.  But it's just very hard right before an election. So we've got maybe a window of two, three months to get the ball rolling in the House of Representatives.  And your voices are going to be absolutely critical to that effort.

So I just want to say thank you to all of you.  And while I'm here, I want to thank you for a wide range of issues that we've had a chance to cooperate with you on.  Whether it's dealing with counterterrorism issues and the preparations that ensure that if and when an event happens that we're prepared, and more importantly, that we're able to prevent such activities from taking place in the first place, or dealing with natural disasters where our first responders are always right there on the scene, day in and day out your teams, your personnel are doing heroic work on behalf of America.  And we're very, very grateful for that.

So thank you, everybody.  Let’s make this happen.  (Applause.)",President,Barack Obama,https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/the-press-office/2014/05/13/remarks-president-law-enforcement-briefing-immigration,,OTHERS
USA,02-11-2015,Barack Obama,"
Remarks by the President on Criminal Justice Reform","Well, good afternoon, everybody.  It is good to be in Newark.  (Applause.)  Let me, first of all, thank your chancellor, Nancy Cantor, for hosting us here today.  Where’s Nancy?  (Applause.)  There she is.   Your Mayor, Ras Baraka, is here.  (Applause.)  Your Senator, Cory Booker, is in the house.  (Applause.)  Where did Cory go?  There he is, right here.  Your Congressman, Donald Payne, Jr.  (Applause.)

Over the course of this year, I’ve been talking to people all across the country about reforming our criminal justice system to be fairer, to be smarter, to be more effective.  I’ve met with police chiefs and beat cops.  I've met with prisoners, corrections officers.  I've met with families of fallen police officers and families of children who were killed by gun violence.  I've met with men and women battling drug abuse, and rehab coaches, and folks working on new solutions for treatment.

And I have to tell you that from all these conversations, I have, at times, despaired about the magnitude of the problem.  I've asked myself, how do we break the cycle that has young children somehow on that pipeline where they end up incarcerated? And yet, what’s interesting is I've been really hopeful, as well, during the course of this year because what I've seen is that there are people across the board -- folks who work inside the criminal justice system, folks who are affected by the criminal justice system -- who are saying, there’s got to be a better way to do this, and are not just asking questions about how we make the system smarter and more effective but are also showing us how it's done and are actually implementing it.  

This afternoon, I spent I’ve spent with the Mayor and Senator Booker, getting a firsthand look at how Newark is helping to lead the way.  And as a partner in our My Brother’s Keeper Initiative, the Mayor and the Senator and Congressman and others are working in a public-private partnership to focus on disrupting the pipeline from underfunded schools to overcrowded jails.  Here in Newark, when it comes to rehabilitating prisoners and reintegrating former inmates into society, you’ve got organizations that are doing extraordinary work.  And that’s why I wanted to focus here today, because places like Integrity House, the work that's being done in our federal ReNew program through the District Court and our U.S. Attorneys Office -- they are accomplishing extraordinary things.  And when you meet folks who are taking that step to break addiction and overcome great odds, and you see what they’ve already accomplished and what more they’re going to accomplish in the future, you cannot help but feel hopeful about the future. 

Now, right now, there are 2.2 million Americans behind bars -- 2.2 million.  We incarcerate people at a rate that is unequaled around the world.  We account for 5 percent of the world’s population, 25 percent of its inmates.  They are disproportionately black and Latino.  As one of Cory’s Republican colleagues, John Cornyn from Texas -- no bleeding-heart liberal here -- likes to point out, almost all these individuals will eventually be released.  More than 600,000 inmates are released each year.  Around 70 million Americans have some sort of criminal record -- 70 million.  That’s almost one in five of us. Almost one in three Americans of working age.  

Now, a lot of time, that record disqualifies you from being a full participant in our society -- even if you’ve already paid your debt to society.  It means millions of Americans have difficulty even getting their foot in the door to try to get a job much less actually hang on to that job.  That's bad for not only those individuals, it's bad for our economy.  It’s bad for the communities that desperately need more role models who are gainfully employed.  So we’ve got to make sure Americans who’ve paid their debt to society can earn their second chance.  

And as I said before, we spent the day seeing people who are doing just that -- counselors; parole officers; small business owners who are giving folks a second chance; federal judges who are not only being smart about sentencing but are also helping, to the extent that they’re going into their own pockets, just to help somebody who is transitioning out get the right clothes for a job interview.  

I’ve spoken to men and women who are part of programs like NJ-STEP here at Rutgers-Newark.  You’re giving prisoners a chance to start taking college courses before their release so that they can re-enter society with marketable skills.  

And I've had a chance, as I said, to speak with folks who are working hard to get back on track.  And I just want to highlight a couple of them -- I hope you guys aren't embarrassed, if you're here, because I'm really proud of what you're doing.

Daryl Rose was arrested for a drug-related abuse charge in 2013, served six months in prison.  Today he’s a member of Integrity House -- that's a treatment center that I visited earlier this afternoon -- determined to become a productive citizen.  And he’s getting the counseling and support that he needs to achieve his goals.  And Daryl’s family is with him every step of the way.  So we're very proud of Daryl.  (Applause.)  I don't know if Daryl is here.  Are you here, Daryl?  

Ashley Sinclair.  Ashley is here today -- I know that.  Where’s Ashley?  Come on -- there you are.  Stand up, Ashley.  (Applause.)  Ashley spent most of her 21 years on the streets, and involved in crime.  Eventually, she decided she wanted something better for herself, joined a program called Project HOPE, impressed everybody with her work ethic.  She earned a place in the Newark Department of Sanitation.  And today, instead of getting into trouble on the streets, she’s earning a paycheck cleaning up those streets.  So we are proud of Ashley.  (Applause.)   

We want more success stories like these.  It’s good for everybody.  It means less crime.  It means less recidivism.  It means less money spent on incarceration.  It means less wasted taxpayer money.  It means police aren't having to arrest the same folks over and over.  It means young people are seeing in their community people who are working.  That, in turn, creates economies in those communities that are legal and not just illegal, which creates redevelopment for everybody.  And now, suddenly businesses have more customers, which means they’re hiring more, and you get a virtuous cycle.    

That’s why today, we’re taking two new actions to create more success stories like this.  These are actions that I can take as President through my executive authorities.

Number one, my administration is announcing new grants to help returning citizens seize that second chance through education and job training and housing and legal help and children’s services.  (Applause.)  Five cities are announcing commitments of their own to help folks re-entering society to train for high-tech jobs.  And we're going to be partnering with them and others to try to make sure that the good work that we saw here today we can start expanding.  All right, so that's point number one, putting some more money in the system.

Let me say it's nowhere near what we need, but it gives us more ability to create more programs that serve as an example of best practices so it can be duplicated around the country.  That's point number one. 

Point number two, I’m taking action to “ban the box” -- (applause) -- for the most competitive jobs at federal agencies. 

Now, the federal government is a big employer, as you know, and like a lot of big employers, on many job applications there’s a box that asks if you have a criminal record.  If you answer yes, then a lot of times you’re not getting a call back.  We’re going to do our part in changing this.  The federal government, I believe, should not use criminal history to screen out applicants before we even look at their qualifications.  We can’t dismiss people out of hand simply because of a mistake that they made in the past.  

And I have to say that, although this is something that I can do on an executive basis, this is an area where Cory Booker, working with one of his Republican colleagues, Ron Johnson, are working to try to pass federal legislation -- a ban-the-box bill that’s working its way through the Senate.  I believe Congress should pass legislation that builds on today’s announcement.  And keep in mind some really good, really successful companies are already doing this.  Walmart, Target, Koch Industries, Home Depot -- they’ve already taken action to ban the box on their own.  And 19 states have done the same.  

So my hope is, is that with the federal government also taking action, us getting legislation passed -- this becomes a basic principle across our society.  It is relevant to find out whether somebody has a criminal record.  We’re not suggesting ignore it.  What we are suggesting is, when it comes to the application, give folks a chance to get through the door.  (Applause.)  Give them a chance to get in there so that they can make their case.  

Now, this is not just the only step that we can take.  Just two weeks ago, Cory, other Democrats and Republicans moved through the Senate a bipartisan criminal justice reform bill.  This is a bill that would reduce mandatory minimums for non-violent offenders.  It would invest in law enforcement.  It would reward prisoners with time off if they complete programs that make it less likely that they will commit crimes in the future.  And there’s a similar bill working its way through the House.  

I urgently encourage both the Senate and the House to pass these bills.  It will not completely change the system overnight, but it will lock in some basic principles that we understand are going to make us a fairer and safer society over the long term.  And I am very proud of the work that those legislators are doing. I’m especially proud because it’s not typical that Democrats and Republicans get together -- (laughter) -- on useful legislation  -- let’s face it.  But this is an area where we’ve seen some really strong bipartisan work, and I’m very encouraged by that.

There are so many Americans who desperately want to earn a second chance.  I already mentioned Daryl and Ashley.  I’m going to call out one other person -- Dquan Rosario.  Where’s Dquan?  He’s looking very sharp in his suit today.  (Applause.)  Now, Dquan was arrested for his first drug charge when he was 17.  At 27 he received a 10-year federal sentence for drug distribution. In his own words, when he got out he was homeless, had no real legitimate employment history.  And it would be easy to write Dquan off.  More importantly, it would have been easy for Dquan to write himself off -- or at least to say, there’s nothing else I know, this is the path I have to follow -- going back to the drug trade that, unfortunately, he had been raised in.

But something happened inside of Dquan, so he had a motivation to say, I’m going to change -- which is really hard to do at 37.  It’s even harder to do if you’ve been through a decade or more of prison.  So he got involved with a Justice Department program called ReNew.  The federal District Court judge who presides over this program -- Madeleine, stand up.  I just want to give her credit.  (Applause.)  The probation officer who worked with him, Kevin, who helps run this program.  (Applause.) This isn’t in my formal remarks, but I just talked to them.  I just think everybody needs to understand what happened here.  

So with the help of our U.S. Attorney, Paul Fishman -- right here.  Paul, stand up -- (applause) -- the Justice Department, the federal District Court judge, the probation officer -- they all set up a system in which Dquan has a community encouraging him to move forward.  If he doesn’t have the right suit for a job application, they’re helping him do that.  If he doesn’t have enough money to eat that week, they’re seeing if they can scrape something together.  If he’s interested in going back to school, what happened was, is that these folks helped to scrape together school fees for him, including through the Second Chance dollars that we generate through the Justice Department.  

And as Dquan just told me, he said, look, I’m not saying that everything is easy; you’ve got to want it yourself.  But because of the investment of these people who are calling him and bringing him in every couple weeks, and Kevin, his probation officer, is problem-solving with him on an ongoing basis -- Dquan found a job in medical transportation.  Then he pursued his EMT certification.  Today, he is an EMT in Essex County.  (Applause.) And instead of peddling drugs that are destroying lives, he’s saving lives.  He’s making the community better.  

And I just want to highlight this story because here you’ve got a situation where officers of the court, judges, probation officers, U.S. attorneys, pastors, community leaders, business leaders are all coming together saying, what’s the problem we’re trying to solve here?  The problem we’re trying to solve is not just to keep on catching people and putting them back in jail.  The problem we’re trying to solve here is giving people a foundation through which they can then become productive citizens.  And the judge was mentioning how when she saw Dquan or some of the other folks who have gone through this program graduate, that’s the best thing that happens to her as a judge -- because she understands that’s the goal.   

The goal is to prevent crime.  The goal is to make sure that folks are fairly punished when they break the law.  But the ultimate goal is to make sure that folks are law-abiding, self-sufficient, good citizens.  And everything we do should be designed towards that goal.  (Applause.)  And if we’re doing a good job there, then crime will go down and it will stay down.

That’s our goal -- where everybody has a chance to contribute.  And that’s what these outstanding folks that I met with here today are committed to.  That’s what Mayor Baraka and Cory Booker and Don Payne, Jr. and others are committed to.  That’s what I’m committed to.  This is not easy.  And as I’ve said before, we can’t have the criminal justice system carrying the entire load of solving all of society’s ills.  

We’re a lot better off if we catch Dquan when he’s 5, or 12, or 18, than when he’s 37.  We’re a lot better off if we’re investing in economic development and housing and jobs and adequate funding for schools, and making college more affordable on the front end.  But Dquan’s story, like the stories that so many people in this auditorium can tell, is that it’s not too late.  There are people who have gone through tough times, they’ve made mistakes.  But with a little bit of help, they can get on the right path.  (Applause.)  

And that’s what we have to invest in.  That’s what we have to believe.  That’s what we have to promote.  That’s why I’m so proud of what Newark is doing, and that’s what I hope everybody learns.  

Thank you very much, everybody.  God bless you.  God bless the United States of America.  Thank you.",President,Barack Obama,https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/the-press-office/2015/11/02/remarks-president-criminal-justice-reform,,DEVELOPMENT
Russia,18-03-2014,Vladimir Putin,Address by President of the Russian Federation,"Federation Council members, State Duma deputies, good afternoon. Representatives of the Republic of Crimea and Sevastopol are here among us, citizens of Russia, residents of Crimea and Sevastopol!

Dear friends, we have gathered here today in connection with an issue that is of vital, historic significance to all of us. A referendum was held in Crimea on March 16 in full compliance with democratic procedures and international norms.

More than 82 percent of the electorate took part in the vote. Over 96 percent of them spoke out in favour of reuniting with Russia. These numbers speak for themselves.

To understand the reason behind such a choice it is enough to know the history of Crimea and what Russia and Crimea have always meant for each other.

Everything in Crimea speaks of our shared history and pride. This is the location of ancient Khersones, where Prince Vladimir was baptised. His spiritual feat of adopting Orthodoxy predetermined the overall basis of the culture, civilisation and human values that unite the peoples of Russia, Ukraine and Belarus. The graves of Russian soldiers whose bravery brought Crimea into the Russian empire are also in Crimea. This is also Sevastopol – a legendary city with an outstanding history, a fortress that serves as the birthplace of Russia’s Black Sea Fleet. Crimea is Balaklava and Kerch, Malakhov Kurgan and Sapun Ridge. Each one of these places is dear to our hearts, symbolising Russian military glory and outstanding valour.

Crimea is a unique blend of different peoples’ cultures and traditions. This makes it similar to Russia as a whole, where not a single ethnic group has been lost over the centuries. Russians and Ukrainians, Crimean Tatars and people of other ethnic groups have lived side by side in Crimea, retaining their own identity, traditions, languages and faith.

Incidentally, the total population of the Crimean Peninsula today is 2.2 million people, of whom almost 1.5 million are Russians, 350,000 are Ukrainians who predominantly consider Russian their native language, and about 290,000–300,000 are Crimean Tatars, who, as the referendum has shown, also lean towards Russia.

True, there was a time when Crimean Tatars were treated unfairly, just as a number of other peoples in the USSR. There is only one thing I can say here: millions of people of various ethnicities suffered during those repressions, and primarily Russians.

Crimean Tatars returned to their homeland. I believe we should make all the necessary political and legislative decisions to finalise the rehabilitation of Crimean Tatars, restore them in their rights and clear their good name.

We have great respect for people of all the ethnic groups living in Crimea. This is their common home, their motherland, and it would be right – I know the local population supports this – for Crimea to have three equal national languages: Russian, Ukrainian and Tatar.

Colleagues,

In people’s hearts and minds, Crimea has always been an inseparable part of Russia. This firm conviction is based on truth and justice and was passed from generation to generation, over time, under any circumstances, despite all the dramatic changes our country went through during the entire 20th century.

After the revolution, the Bolsheviks, for a number of reasons – may God judge them – added large sections of the historical South of Russia to the Republic of Ukraine. This was done with no consideration for the ethnic make-up of the population, and today these areas form the southeast of Ukraine. Then, in 1954, a decision was made to transfer Crimean Region to Ukraine, along with Sevastopol, despite the fact that it was a federal city. This was the personal initiative of the Communist Party head Nikita Khrushchev. What stood behind this decision of his – a desire to win the support of the Ukrainian political establishment or to atone for the mass repressions of the 1930’s in Ukraine – is for historians to figure out.

What matters now is that this decision was made in clear violation of the constitutional norms that were in place even then. The decision was made behind the scenes. Naturally, in a totalitarian state nobody bothered to ask the citizens of Crimea and Sevastopol. They were faced with the fact. People, of course, wondered why all of a sudden Crimea became part of Ukraine. But on the whole – and we must state this clearly, we all know it – this decision was treated as a formality of sorts because the territory was transferred within the boundaries of a single state. Back then, it was impossible to imagine that Ukraine and Russia may split up and become two separate states. However, this has happened.

Unfortunately, what seemed impossible became a reality. The USSR fell apart. Things developed so swiftly that few people realised how truly dramatic those events and their consequences would be. Many people both in Russia and in Ukraine, as well as in other republics hoped that the Commonwealth of Independent States that was created at the time would become the new common form of statehood. They were told that there would be a single currency, a single economic space, joint armed forces; however, all this remained empty promises, while the big country was gone. It was only when Crimea ended up as part of a different country that Russia realised that it was not simply robbed, it was plundered.

At the same time, we have to admit that by launching the sovereignty parade Russia itself aided in the collapse of the Soviet Union. And as this collapse was legalised, everyone forgot about Crimea and Sevastopol ­– the main base of the Black Sea Fleet. Millions of people went to bed in one country and awoke in different ones, overnight becoming ethnic minorities in former Union republics, while the Russian nation became one of the biggest, if not the biggest ethnic group in the world to be divided by borders.

Now, many years later, I heard residents of Crimea say that back in 1991 they were handed over like a sack of potatoes. This is hard to disagree with. And what about the Russian state? What about Russia? It humbly accepted the situation. This country was going through such hard times then that realistically it was incapable of protecting its interests. However, the people could not reconcile themselves to this outrageous historical injustice. All these years, citizens and many public figures came back to this issue, saying that Crimea is historically Russian land and Sevastopol is a Russian city. Yes, we all knew this in our hearts and minds, but we had to proceed from the existing reality and build our good-neighbourly relations with independent Ukraine on a new basis. Meanwhile, our relations with Ukraine, with the fraternal Ukrainian people have always been and will remain of foremost importance for us.

Today we can speak about it openly, and I would like to share with you some details of the negotiations that took place in the early 2000s. The then President of Ukraine Mr Kuchma asked me to expedite the process of delimiting the Russian-Ukrainian border. At that time, the process was practically at a standstill. Russia seemed to have recognised Crimea as part of Ukraine, but there were no negotiations on delimiting the borders. Despite the complexity of the situation, I immediately issued instructions to Russian government agencies to speed up their work to document the borders, so that everyone had a clear understanding that by agreeing to delimit the border we admitted de facto and de jure that Crimea was Ukrainian territory, thereby closing the issue.

We accommodated Ukraine not only regarding Crimea, but also on such a complicated matter as the maritime boundary in the Sea of Azov and the Kerch Strait. What we proceeded from back then was that good relations with Ukraine matter most for us and they should not fall hostage to deadlock territorial disputes. However, we expected Ukraine to remain our good neighbour, we hoped that Russian citizens and Russian speakers in Ukraine, especially its southeast and Crimea, would live in a friendly, democratic and civilised state that would protect their rights in line with the norms of international law.

However, this is not how the situation developed. Time and time again attempts were made to deprive Russians of their historical memory, even of their language and to subject them to forced assimilation. Moreover, Russians, just as other citizens of Ukraine are suffering from the constant political and state crisis that has been rocking the country for over 20 years.

I understand why Ukrainian people wanted change. They have had enough of the authorities in power during the years of Ukraine’s independence. Presidents, prime ministers and parliamentarians changed, but their attitude to the country and its people remained the same. They milked the country, fought among themselves for power, assets and cash flows and did not care much about the ordinary people. They did not wonder why it was that millions of Ukrainian citizens saw no prospects at home and went to other countries to work as day labourers. I would like to stress this: it was not some Silicon Valley they fled to, but to become day labourers. Last year alone almost 3 million people found such jobs in Russia. According to some sources, in 2013 their earnings in Russia totalled over $20 billion, which is about 12% of Ukraine’s GDP.

I would like to reiterate that I understand those who came out on Maidan with peaceful slogans against corruption, inefficient state management and poverty. The right to peaceful protest, democratic procedures and elections exist for the sole purpose of replacing the authorities that do not satisfy the people. However, those who stood behind the latest events in Ukraine had a different agenda: they were preparing yet another government takeover; they wanted to seize power and would stop short of nothing. They resorted to terror, murder and riots. Nationalists, neo-Nazis, Russophobes and anti-Semites executed this coup. They continue to set the tone in Ukraine to this day.

The new so-called authorities began by introducing a draft law to revise the language policy, which was a direct infringement on the rights of ethnic minorities. However, they were immediately ‘disciplined’ by the foreign sponsors of these so-called politicians. One has to admit that the mentors of these current authorities are smart and know well what such attempts to build a purely Ukrainian state may lead to. The draft law was set aside, but clearly reserved for the future. Hardly any mention is made of this attempt now, probably on the presumption that people have a short memory. Nevertheless, we can all clearly see the intentions of these ideological heirs of Bandera, Hitler’s accomplice during World War II.

It is also obvious that there is no legitimate executive authority in Ukraine now, nobody to talk to. Many government agencies have been taken over by the impostors, but they do not have any control in the country, while they themselves – and I would like to stress this – are often controlled by radicals. In some cases, you need a special permit from the militants on Maidan to meet with certain ministers of the current government. This is not a joke – this is reality.

Those who opposed the coup were immediately threatened with repression. Naturally, the first in line here was Crimea, the Russian-speaking Crimea. In view of this, the residents of Crimea and Sevastopol turned to Russia for help in defending their rights and lives, in preventing the events that were unfolding and are still underway in Kiev, Donetsk, Kharkov and other Ukrainian cities.

Naturally, we could not leave this plea unheeded; we could not abandon Crimea and its residents in distress. This would have been betrayal on our part.

First, we had to help create conditions so that the residents of Crimea for the first time in history were able to peacefully express their free will regarding their own future. However, what do we hear from our colleagues in Western Europe and North America? They say we are violating norms of international law. Firstly, it’s a good thing that they at least remember that there exists such a thing as international law – better late than never.

Secondly, and most importantly – what exactly are we violating? True, the President of the Russian Federation received permission from the Upper House of Parliament to use the Armed Forces in Ukraine. However, strictly speaking, nobody has acted on this permission yet. Russia’s Armed Forces never entered Crimea; they were there already in line with an international agreement. True, we did enhance our forces there; however – this is something I would like everyone to hear and know – we did not exceed the personnel limit of our Armed Forces in Crimea, which is set at 25,000, because there was no need to do so.

Next. As it declared independence and decided to hold a referendum, the Supreme Council of Crimea referred to the United Nations Charter, which speaks of the right of nations to self-determination. Incidentally, I would like to remind you that when Ukraine seceded from the USSR it did exactly the same thing, almost word for word. Ukraine used this right, yet the residents of Crimea are denied it. Why is that?

Moreover, the Crimean authorities referred to the well-known Kosovo precedent – a precedent our western colleagues created with their own hands in a very similar situation, when they agreed that the unilateral separation of Kosovo from Serbia, exactly what Crimea is doing now, was legitimate and did not require any permission from the country’s central authorities. Pursuant to Article 2, Chapter 1 of the United Nations Charter, the UN International Court agreed with this approach and made the following comment in its ruling of July 22, 2010, and I quote: “No general prohibition may be inferred from the practice of the Security Council with regard to declarations of independence,” and “General international law contains no prohibition on declarations of independence.” Crystal clear, as they say.

I do not like to resort to quotes, but in this case, I cannot help it. Here is a quote from another official document: the Written Statement of the United States America of April 17, 2009, submitted to the same UN International Court in connection with the hearings on Kosovo. Again, I quote: “Declarations of independence may, and often do, violate domestic legislation. However, this does not make them violations of international law.” End of quote. They wrote this, disseminated it all over the world, had everyone agree and now they are outraged. Over what? The actions of Crimean people completely fit in with these instructions, as it were. For some reason, things that Kosovo Albanians (and we have full respect for them) were permitted to do, Russians, Ukrainians and Crimean Tatars in Crimea are not allowed. Again, one wonders why.

We keep hearing from the United States and Western Europe that Kosovo is some special case. What makes it so special in the eyes of our colleagues? It turns out that it is the fact that the conflict in Kosovo resulted in so many human casualties. Is this a legal argument? The ruling of the International Court says nothing about this. This is not even double standards; this is amazing, primitive, blunt cynicism. One should not try so crudely to make everything suit their interests, calling the same thing white today and black tomorrow. According to this logic, we have to make sure every conflict leads to human losses.

I will state clearly — if the Crimean local self-defence units had not taken the situation under control, there could have been casualties as well. Fortunately this did not happen. There was not a single armed confrontation in Crimea and no casualties. Why do you think this was so? The answer is simple: because it is very difficult, practically impossible to fight against the will of the people. Here I would like to thank the Ukrainian military – and this is 22,000 fully armed servicemen. I would like to thank those Ukrainian service members who refrained from bloodshed and did not smear their uniforms in blood.

Other thoughts come to mind in this connection. They keep talking of some Russian intervention in Crimea, some sort of aggression. This is strange to hear. I cannot recall a single case in history of an intervention without a single shot being fired and with no human casualties.

Colleagues,

Like a mirror, the situation in Ukraine reflects what is going on and what has been happening in the world over the past several decades. After the dissolution of bipolarity on the planet, we no longer have stability. Key international institutions are not getting any stronger; on the contrary, in many cases, they are sadly degrading. Our western partners, led by the United States of America, prefer not to be guided by international law in their practical policies, but by the rule of the gun. They have come to believe in their exclusivity and exceptionalism, that they can decide the destinies of the world, that only they can ever be right. They act as they please: here and there, they use force against sovereign states, building coalitions based on the principle “If you are not with us, you are against us.” To make this aggression look legitimate, they force the necessary resolutions from international organisations, and if for some reason this does not work, they simply ignore the UN Security Council and the UN overall.

This happened in Yugoslavia; we remember 1999 very well. It was hard to believe, even seeing it with my own eyes, that at the end of the 20th century, one of Europe’s capitals, Belgrade, was under missile attack for several weeks, and then came the real intervention. Was there a UN Security Council resolution on this matter, allowing for these actions? Nothing of the sort. And then, they hit Afghanistan, Iraq, and frankly violated the UN Security Council resolution on Libya, when instead of imposing the so-called no-fly zone over it they started bombing it too.

There was a whole series of controlled “colour” revolutions. Clearly, the people in those nations, where these events took place, were sick of tyranny and poverty, of their lack of prospects; but these feelings were taken advantage of cynically. Standards were imposed on these nations that did not in any way correspond to their way of life, traditions, or these peoples’ cultures. As a result, instead of democracy and freedom, there was chaos, outbreaks in violence and a series of upheavals. The Arab Spring turned into the Arab Winter.

A similar situation unfolded in Ukraine. In 2004, to push the necessary candidate through at the presidential elections, they thought up some sort of third round that was not stipulated by the law. It was absurd and a mockery of the constitution. And now, they have thrown in an organised and well-equipped army of militants.

We understand what is happening; we understand that these actions were aimed against Ukraine and Russia and against Eurasian integration. And all this while Russia strived to engage in dialogue with our colleagues in the West. We are constantly proposing cooperation on all key issues; we want to strengthen our level of trust and for our relations to be equal, open and fair. But we saw no reciprocal steps.

On the contrary, they have lied to us many times, made decisions behind our backs, placed us before an accomplished fact. This happened with NATO’s expansion to the East, as well as the deployment of military infrastructure at our borders. They kept telling us the same thing: “Well, this does not concern you.” That’s easy to say.

It happened with the deployment of a missile defence system. In spite of all our apprehensions, the project is working and moving forward. It happened with the endless foot-dragging in the talks on visa issues, promises of fair competition and free access to global markets.

Today, we are being threatened with sanctions, but we already experience many limitations, ones that are quite significant for us, our economy and our nation. For example, still during the times of the Cold War, the US and subsequently other nations restricted a large list of technologies and equipment from being sold to the USSR, creating the Coordinating Committee for Multilateral Export Controls list. Today, they have formally been eliminated, but only formally; and in reality, many limitations are still in effect.

In short, we have every reason to assume that the infamous policy of containment, led in the 18th, 19th and 20th centuries, continues today. They are constantly trying to sweep us into a corner because we have an independent position, because we maintain it and because we call things like they are and do not engage in hypocrisy. But there is a limit to everything. And with Ukraine, our western partners have crossed the line, playing the bear and acting irresponsibly and unprofessionally.

After all, they were fully aware that there are millions of Russians living in Ukraine and in Crimea. They must have really lacked political instinct and common sense not to foresee all the consequences of their actions. Russia found itself in a position it could not retreat from. If you compress the spring all the way to its limit, it will snap back hard. You must always remember this.

Today, it is imperative to end this hysteria, to refute the rhetoric of the cold war and to accept the obvious fact: Russia is an independent, active participant in international affairs; like other countries, it has its own national interests that need to be taken into account and respected.

At the same time, we are grateful to all those who understood our actions in Crimea; we are grateful to the people of China, whose leaders have always considered the situation in Ukraine and Crimea taking into account the full historical and political context, and greatly appreciate India’s reserve and objectivity.

Today, I would like to address the people of the United States of America, the people who, since the foundation of their nation and adoption of the Declaration of Independence, have been proud to hold freedom above all else. Isn’t the desire of Crimea’s residents to freely choose their fate such a value? Please understand us.

I believe that the Europeans, first and foremost, the Germans, will also understand me. Let me remind you that in the course of political consultations on the unification of East and West Germany, at the expert, though very high level, some nations that were then and are now Germany’s allies did not support the idea of unification. Our nation, however, unequivocally supported the sincere, unstoppable desire of the Germans for national unity. I am confident that you have not forgotten this, and I expect that the citizens of Germany will also support the aspiration of the Russians, of historical Russia, to restore unity.

I also want to address the people of Ukraine. I sincerely want you to understand us: we do not want to harm you in any way, or to hurt your national feelings. We have always respected the territorial integrity of the Ukrainian state, incidentally, unlike those who sacrificed Ukraine’s unity for their political ambitions. They flaunt slogans about Ukraine’s greatness, but they are the ones who did everything to divide the nation. Today’s civil standoff is entirely on their conscience. I want you to hear me, my dear friends. Do not believe those who want you to fear Russia, shouting that other regions will follow Crimea. We do not want to divide Ukraine; we do not need that. As for Crimea, it was and remains a Russian, Ukrainian, and Crimean-Tatar land.

I repeat, just as it has been for centuries, it will be a home to all the peoples living there. What it will never be and do is follow in Bandera’s footsteps!

Crimea is our common historical legacy and a very important factor in regional stability. And this strategic territory should be part of a strong and stable sovereignty, which today can only be Russian. Otherwise, dear friends (I am addressing both Ukraine and Russia), you and we – the Russians and the Ukrainians – could lose Crimea completely, and that could happen in the near historical perspective. Please think about it.

Let me note too that we have already heard declarations from Kiev about Ukraine soon joining NATO. What would this have meant for Crimea and Sevastopol in the future? It would have meant that NATO’s navy would be right there in this city of Russia’s military glory, and this would create not an illusory but a perfectly real threat to the whole of southern Russia. These are things that could have become reality were it not for the choice the Crimean people made, and I want to say thank you to them for this.

But let me say too that we are not opposed to cooperation with NATO, for this is certainly not the case. For all the internal processes within the organisation, NATO remains a military alliance, and we are against having a military alliance making itself at home right in our backyard or in our historic territory. I simply cannot imagine that we would travel to Sevastopol to visit NATO sailors. Of course, most of them are wonderful guys, but it would be better to have them come and visit us, be our guests, rather than the other way round.

Let me say quite frankly that it pains our hearts to see what is happening in Ukraine at the moment, see the people’s suffering and their uncertainty about how to get through today and what awaits them tomorrow. Our concerns are understandable because we are not simply close neighbours but, as I have said many times already, we are one people. Kiev is the mother of Russian cities. Ancient Rus is our common source and we cannot live without each other.

Let me say one other thing too. Millions of Russians and Russian-speaking people live in Ukraine and will continue to do so. Russia will always defend their interests using political, diplomatic and legal means. But it should be above all in Ukraine’s own interest to ensure that these people’s rights and interests are fully protected. This is the guarantee of Ukraine’s state stability and territorial integrity.

We want to be friends with Ukraine and we want Ukraine to be a strong, sovereign and self-sufficient country. Ukraine is one of our biggest partners after all. We have many joint projects and I believe in their success no matter what the current difficulties. Most importantly, we want peace and harmony to reign in Ukraine, and we are ready to work together with other countries to do everything possible to facilitate and support this. But as I said, only Ukraine’s own people can put their own house in order.

Residents of Crimea and the city of Sevastopol, the whole of Russia admired your courage, dignity and bravery. It was you who decided Crimea’s future. We were closer than ever over these days, supporting each other. These were sincere feelings of solidarity. It is at historic turning points such as these that a nation demonstrates its maturity and strength of spirit. The Russian people showed this maturity and strength through their united support for their compatriots.

Russia’s foreign policy position on this matter drew its firmness from the will of millions of our people, our national unity and the support of our country’s main political and public forces. I want to thank everyone for this patriotic spirit, everyone without exception. Now, we need to continue and maintain this kind of consolidation so as to resolve the tasks our country faces on its road ahead.

Obviously, we will encounter external opposition, but this is a decision that we need to make for ourselves. Are we ready to consistently defend our national interests, or will we forever give in, retreat to who knows where? Some Western politicians are already threatening us with not just sanctions but also the prospect of increasingly serious problems on the domestic front. I would like to know what it is they have in mind exactly: action by a fifth column, this disparate bunch of ‘national traitors’, or are they hoping to put us in a worsening social and economic situation so as to provoke public discontent? We consider such statements irresponsible and clearly aggressive in tone, and we will respond to them accordingly. At the same time, we will never seek confrontation with our partners, whether in the East or the West, but on the contrary, will do everything we can to build civilised and good-neighbourly relations as one is supposed to in the modern world. 

Colleagues,

I understand the people of Crimea, who put the question in the clearest possible terms in the referendum: should Crimea be with Ukraine or with Russia? We can be sure in saying that the authorities in Crimea and Sevastopol, the legislative authorities, when they formulated the question, set aside group and political interests and made the people’s fundamental interests alone the cornerstone of their work. The particular historic, population, political and economic circumstances of Crimea would have made any other proposed option — however tempting it could be at the first glance — only temporary and fragile and would have inevitably led to further worsening of the situation there, which would have had disastrous effects on people’s lives. The people of Crimea thus decided to put the question in firm and uncompromising form, with no grey areas. The referendum was fair and transparent, and the people of Crimea clearly and convincingly expressed their will and stated that they want to be with Russia.

Russia will also have to make a difficult decision now, taking into account the various domestic and external considerations. What do people here in Russia think? Here, like in any democratic country, people have different points of view, but I want to make the point that the absolute majority of our people clearly do support what is happening.

The most recent public opinion surveys conducted here in Russia show that 95 percent of people think that Russia should protect the interests of Russians and members of other ethnic groups living in Crimea – 95 percent of our citizens. More than 83 percent think that Russia should do this even if it will complicate our relations with some other countries. A total of 86 percent of our people see Crimea as still being Russian territory and part of our country’s lands. And one particularly important figure, which corresponds exactly with the result in Crimea’s referendum: almost 92 percent of our people support Crimea’s reunification with Russia. 

Thus we see that the overwhelming majority of people in Crimea and the absolute majority of the Russian Federation’s people support the reunification of the Republic of Crimea and the city of Sevastopol with Russia.

Now this is a matter for Russia’s own political decision, and any decision here can be based only on the people’s will, because the people is the ultimate source of all authority.

Members of the Federation Council, deputies of the State Duma, citizens of Russia, residents of Crimea and Sevastopol, today, in accordance with the people’s will, I submit to the Federal Assembly a request to consider a Constitutional Law on the creation of two new constituent entities within the Russian Federation: the Republic of Crimea and the city of Sevastopol, and to ratify the treaty on admitting to the Russian Federation Crimea and Sevastopol, which is already ready for signing. I stand assured of your support.",President,Vladimir Putin,http://en.kremlin.ru/events/president/transcripts/statements/20603,,NATIONALISM
Russia,19-11-2007,Vladimir Putin,Speech at a meeting with Russian Orthodox Clergy to mark the Ninetieth Anniversary of the Patriarchate’s Restoration,"Your Holiness,

Participants in the meeting,

First of all, I would like to congratulate you on this important date for the Russian Orthodox Church – the ninetieth anniversary of the restoration of the patriarchate. Russian Orthodoxy has a particular role in our country’s history, in the formation of our statehood, culture, morals and spirituality. In restoring the patriarchate, the Church once again showed its strength, independence and ability to organise itself. As has been the case on more than one occasion in the past, the Church showed these qualities at a turning point in our country’s history. The patriarchate helped the Russian Orthodox Church to withstand, together with the people, the most difficult tests and trials of the twentieth century. It helped the Church to defend its faith, unite its flock and preserve not only its own but also the nation’s holy treasures. Later, when religious life began its revival, the patriarchate continued tirelessly to help the Church. Today, we greatly value the Russian Orthodox Church’s efforts to return to our country’s life the ideals and values that served as our spiritual references for so many centuries.

We welcome the Church’s appeal to its faithful to fulfil their duty not only to their families and loved ones but also to cultivate a spirit of patriotism based on service to their homeland and a sense of civic responsibility. The state has respect for all of the country’s traditional and other religions that are a source of spiritual support for many of our citizens. It is therefore particularly important that peace and harmony between these different religions reigns in our society. We place great importance on the Russian Orthodox Church’s efforts to develop dialogue and cooperation between the different religions and to strengthen the spirit of religious tolerance. This aspect of the Church’s work, like other socially important areas of its work, has our all-round support. The state and the Church have ample scope for working together to strengthen morality and educate the young generation, and of course, to preserve our country’s spiritual and cultural heritage.

The state will continue to support the Church in restoring and maintaining the historical and cultural monuments transferred to it and in carrying out philanthropic work.

The Church’s cultural and educational projects are also important. In this respect, the Government has been instructed to examine the question of making financial and other assistance available to religious organisations in order to develop and launch relevant television and radio programmes.

The demographic situation is one of the most pressing issues that the state and religious organisations must address together. The state, as you know, is working hard on improving the demographic situation today and is putting in place favourable social and economic conditions. But reviving family values and changing people’s attitudes to the institution of the family and issues of children’s education is possible only through consolidated effort by all of society, and the traditional religions have a very important role to play in this respect.

I would like to mention another topical matter. We know what importance the Russian Orthodox Church places on religious education. Last week, the State Duma passed amendments to the law on education and freedom of conscience giving religious organisations the right to accredit their educational programmes in accordance with state education standards and to issue diplomas recognised by the state. I am pleased that the Moscow Patriarchate has welcomed these amendments. There is a need today for various forms of religious education in our general school programme, and this doesn’t mean teaching children about one particular religion. Municipal schools have developed, for example, the practice of teaching a course on the basics of the country’s traditional religions, Orthodoxy, Islam and others, and a course on religion in Russia. I think that all of these forms of religious education may have a place in our education system. It would be good to make an overview of the experience gained so far and take into account the need for spiritual and moral education when drawing up education standards. Of course, the principle that religious education should be conducted on a voluntary basis also needs to be observed.

Dear participants,

Our country stands on the eve of an important social and political event – the parliamentary election. The stability of our country’s development and the continuation of the positive changes that have already taken place in our lives depend directly on the election’s outcome. I am sure that Orthodox Christians, like other citizens in our country, will show their active civic spirit.

In conclusion, I would like to inform you that I have issued an instruction to examine the question of presenting as a gift to the Russian Orthodox Church particularly revered holy Christian relics from the Moscow Kremlin Museum’s collection.

Thank you for your attention.",President,Vladimir Putin,http://en.kremlin.ru/events/president/transcripts/statements/24679,,OTHERS
Russia,18-12-2009,Dmitry Medvedev,Speech at Climate Change Conference Plenary Session,"Mr Chairman, Mr Secretary-General of the United Nations, heads of state and government, ladies and gentlemen,

Today’s summit is evidence of the unprecedented attention we are giving to climate change. It is also evidence that we clearly underestimated the difficulties involved in reaching accords, and not just producing a legally binding agreement, but even drafting a general declaration. Obviously, global climate change is a very complex issue and there are different points of view. Some are confident that we can abolish the threats and eliminate the dangers, while others say that the situation does not depend on our actions alone, and that we must therefore be very careful in our intervention. Whatever the case, we have a duty to do everything we can to ensure that humanity’s impact on nature causes as little harm as possible.

This is why, as the first stage of the Kyoto Protocol comes to an end in 2012, we need to put a more modern and effective mechanism in place, a working legal agreement that will regulate international cooperation. This should be a universal agreement based on the principles of fairness and common responsibility, with different countries bearing different shares of the responsibility according to their development levels.

Speaking just before from this tribune, the prime minister of India, Dr Manmohan Singh, said that the countries suffering the most from the problems caused by climate change are those either not at all or in the smallest part responsible for it in the first place. This is indeed the case, and this is why we must bear different shares of the responsibility. But we have to design an instrument that works, and we have to reach accords on principles that we can put into actual practical use. This is not easy. I remember when the Russian Federation decided to become a party to the Kyoto Protocol. There was a tremendous amount of debate. But we made this decision and we think it was the right one.

Russia is the world leader today in reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Over the last 17 years our emissions have dropped 30 percent compared to the level they were at in 1990. Our country accounts for half of all reduction in emissions in the world over the last 20 years. This has gone a long way towards offsetting increases in harmful emissions in other countries.

At the same time, Russia has maintained its place as one of the world’s biggest producers and exporters of energy resources and energy-intensive goods. We will continue to play our part in ensuring global energy security.

But for all this, we think that we still need to do a lot more. The Russian Federation is ready to take part in drafting a legally binding agreement and is ready to set emission targets and commit itself to an unprecedented cumulative reduction in greenhouse gas emissions of more than 30 billion tons between 1990 and 2020 which is equivalent to a 25 percent drop in emissions over this period

I want to stress that we will pursue these efforts regardless of whether or not we manage here to agree on the basic principles and regardless of whether or not we reach a legally binding agreement. We will do this for the simple reason that it is in our own best interests. We think that other countries should take this same approach. We all have an interest in radically improving the state of our environment.

A global agreement must take into account the role played by forests – the main absorbers of greenhouse gases. It should also provide for acceptable conditions for transferring modern technology to developing countries. State financing should be used above all to encourage private investment, and also to implement adaptation measures in the countries worst affected by the consequences of climate change. Only then will modernisation become truly accessible for all.

Practically every nation on our planet is here in this huge hall today to discuss the global climate deal, and this is not an empty slogan, but is a real chance to spread the use of clean, energy-efficient and low-emission technology on a large scale. We simply must make use of this opportunity. This is a chance for new scientific solutions, green economic growth and green investment all around the world. Ultimately, the measures we implement to protect our climate will help to resolve global environmental problems and social and economic problems too, and help to achieve those very same millennium development goals that we set some time ago.

I stress that Russia is ready to play the most active part in all of this processes. We recognise our share of the responsibility and this is the guideline in our efforts.

Judging by the way discussions are going here in this hall and in the narrow-format meetings and working groups, we still have a long and difficult road ahead. But we should not lose heart, for humanity has had to resolve difficult issues in the past, and we have learned to come up with harmonious solutions.

I hope that we will soon have a Road Map to speak of, the implementation of which will take us towards a global agreement.

Thank you for your attention. ",President,Dmitry Medvedev,http://en.kremlin.ru/events/president/transcripts/statements/48541,,INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS
USA,06-08-2015,Barack Obama,"
Remarks by the President on the Voting Rights Act","Thank you, everybody.  (Applause.)  Thank you.  Thank you so much.  Everybody have a seat.  Thank you. 

First of all, I love John Lewis.  (Applause.)  And I don’t know where he gets the energy, where he gets the drive, what stores of passion he’s still able to muster after fighting the good fight for so long.  I do know that many of us would not be here in this auditorium today had it not been for the heroism and dedication of Congressman John Lewis.  So I’m so appreciative of him.  (Applause.) 

I’m proud to be joined by our Attorney General.  Loretta Lynch has already shown herself to be a champion on behalf of not just the powerful but the powerless, and is, every single day, along with her team, fighting to make sure that we are all equal in the eyes of the law, and that everybody is getting a fair shot.  And so we are very grateful for her presence here today.  (Applause.)

And I want to thank all of our partners, all the organizations, all the leadership from around the country that is represented in this auditorium but also are listening over this live feed as we reaffirm our commitment to one of the most fundamental, sacred rights of any democracy -- that is the right to vote. 

As John indicated, 50 years ago today, President Johnson signed the Voting Rights Act into law to protect this precious right.  It broke down legal barriers at the state level and at the local level that were keeping African Americans from exercising their constitutional right to vote.  And all of us have a great debt to not just John Lewis, but the thousands -- many of them unnamed -- who were courageous enough to walk up and try to register time and time again, that were threatened because of their efforts to register -- sharecroppers and maids and ordinary folks.  Had it not been for them awakening the conscience of a nation, the President could not have mustered the political support that was required to ultimately get this seminal law passed. 

We had the opportunity to honor some of the sacrifices that were made earlier this year in Selma, along with 100 members of Congress -- Democratic and Republican members.  It was heartening to see the bipartisan attendance.  It signified that in the abstract, at least, everybody today believes in the right to vote.  Conceptually, everybody is in favor of the right to vote. (Laughter and applause.)  You will not hear anybody defend the notion that the law can discriminate against persons because of their color, or their faith, or their ethnicity, when it comes to going to cast a ballot.  That's huge progress, a normative shift in how we think about our democracy.  Everybody in theory is supposed to be included. 

But part of the reason we're here today, part of the reason it’s so important for us to focus attention on this right is because in practice, we’ve still got problems.

On the ground, there are still too many ways in which people are discouraged from voting.  Some of the protections that had been enshrined in the Voting Rights Act itself have been weakened as a consequence of court decisions and interpretations of the law.  State legislatures have instituted procedures and practices that, although on the surface may appear neutral, have the effect of discouraging people from voting, may have a disproportional effect on certain kinds of folks voting. 

And if, in fact, those practices, those trends, those tendencies are allowed to continue unanswered, then over time the hard-won battles of 50 years ago erode, and our democracy erodes. And that means that the decisions that are made in the corridors of power all across this country begin to reflect the interests of the few, instead of the interests of the many.

So we’ve got serious business to attend to here.  One order of business is for our Congress to pass an updated version of the Voting Rights Act that would correct some of the problems that have arisen.  (Applause.)

And I said when I was in Selma that we’re glad you’re here, members of Congress, but we’ll be even more glad, we’ll be in an even more celebratory mood, if you go back to Washington and reaffirm America’s commitment to what was fought for here at this bridge. 

Now, so far, that hasn’t happened.  John Lewis is ready to do it.  There’s legislation pending.  There are people of goodwill on both sides of the aisle who are prepared to move it. But it keeps on slipping as a priority.  Part of the reason we’re here is to reaffirm to members of Congress, this has to be a priority.  (Applause.)  If this isn’t working then nothing is working.  We’ve got to get it done.  (Applause.)

At the state levels, we’ve got some outstanding members of state legislatures -- California, Florida -- who have been championing mechanisms to get more people voting:  Early voting, online registration.  But sadly, too many states are making it harder for folks to vote -- instituting photo ID laws that on the surface sound good; if you poll the average American, they’ll say, yes, you have to show your photo ID.  But in practice, it turns out that for seniors and for poorer folks, that's not always easy to do.  And by the way, it doesn't actually address a real problem because there are almost no instances of people going to vote in somebody else’s name.  (Applause.)  It’s just not a -- it turns out it’s just not a common crime.  (Laughter.)

Folks, might think about shoplifting.  Attorney General, you know more about the crime statistics than I do, but I am certain, because we’ve actually looked at the data on this, that almost nobody wakes up saying, I’m going to go vote in somebody else’s name.  (Laughter.)  Doesn't happen.  So the only reason to pass this law, despite the reasonableness of how it sounds, is to make it harder for folks to vote.

You've got state legislatures that are rolling back early voting.  I don't understand why anybody would be opposed to spreading out voting so that people can arrange to vote depending on their schedule.  Because it’s hard -- if you are working the midnight shift, and got to get your kid to school, and had to travel by bus, and you're a single mom -- it may be difficult for you to be able to vote precisely in that window that's provided. And there’s no evidence that, as a consequence of early voting, that has increased fraud; that people somehow have become less committed to democracy; they don't feel that same sense of civic pride as they do if there’s just one day of voting.  There’s no evidence of that.  The reason to roll back early voting is because you want to make it harder for folks to vote. 

So, in theory everybody is in favor of the right to vote.  In practice, we have state legislatures that are deliberately trying to make it harder for people to vote. 

And some of them, frankly, are not that shy about saying so.  (Laughter.)  Think about that.  Think about that.  How can you rationalize making it harder for people to vote?  How can you rationalize penalizing people because they don’t have a lot of money not being able to vote?  That’s contrary to who we are.  That’s not what we believe.  That’s not what John Lewis fought for.  In the United States of America, we should have no patience and no tolerance for laws that aim at disenfranchising our fellow citizens. 

So we got to keep pushing.  At the federal level, we need a new Voting Rights Act passed.  At the state and local levels, we’ve got to fight back against efforts to make it harder to vote and we got to embrace those legislators that are prepared to make it easier to vote. 

But there’s one last aspect to this, and that is the job of citizens in actually exercising the franchise.  This isn’t always a popular thing to say in front of progressive groups -- everybody is fired up, and rightly so.  But the reason that the voting rate in the last midterm election was 30-something percent is not attributable to a photo I.D. law.  The fact of the matter is that far more people disenfranchise themselves than any law does by not participating, by not getting involved.

So, yes, we have to be vigilant in pushing back against laws that seek to disenfranchise people.  Yes, we should be fighting back against laws, for example, that say ex-felons, no matter how long they’ve been living a correct life, no matter how well they’ve paid their dues, that they can never vote again in that state.  There are all kinds of battles we have to fight.  But we miss the forest for the trees if we don’t also recognize that huge chunks of us, citizens, just give away our power.  We’d rather complain than do something about it.  We won’t vote, and then we’ll talk about the terrible political process that isn’t doing anything.

And I like barber shop talk.  (Laughter.)  I like grumbling and complaining.  I can’t always do it in public.  (Laughter.)  But what I know is it doesn’t get anything accomplished.  So the groups that are here today, one of the things that we’re looking forward to is how do we mobilize, how do we galvanize, how do we get people focused not only on laws but also on our habits -- our habits of citizenship?  How do we instill in people a sense of why this is so critically important? 

And that is why we are proclaiming September 22nd, National Voter Registration Day.  (Applause.)  September 22nd.  And we're going to have groups fanning out all across the country.  And on September 22nd, we're going to try to get everybody to register to vote.  We probably won’t get everybody, but we're going to try. 

I want to thank so many of you who are involved in this, including the NAACP, which started their Journey to Justice -- a march from Selma to Washington earlier this week -- because you're shining a light on this issue.  And I want to make sure that we are fully mobilized across the country on September 22nd.

The bottom line is everybody here has a part to play.  Members of Congress need to do the right thing.  State legislators and governors, they need to do the right thing.  Businesses -- make it easier for your employees to vote.  Do the right thing.  Universities, other civic institutions -- help register people to vote; provide civic education.  Do the right thing. 

Most of all, citizens -- seize the power that you have.  Make this democracy work.  Do not succumb to cynicism.  Heroic things happen when people get involved.  Heroic things happen when a young man without any official title joins up with a bunch of other young and not-so-young people of every color and every persuasion and are willing to march across a bridge.  That's the power that is in all of us.  We got to take advantage of it.

USA,29-07-2019 00:00,Donald Trump,"Remarks by President Trump at Signing of H.R. 1327, an Act to Permanently Authorize the September 11th Victim Compensation Fund","THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you very much.  Well, thank you very much, everybody.  Please, sit down.  Very important day.  And we’re gathered this morning at the White House to honor our solemn duty to America’s best, bravest, and finest, who I know so well.  In a few moments, I will sign a bipartisan bill to fully reauthorize the 9/11 Victims Compensation Fund.  So, the 9/11 Victims Compensation Fund is something you’ve all worked on very hard, and the day has come.

Today, we come together as one nation to support our September 11th heroes, to care for their families, and to renew our eternal vow: Never, Ever Forget.

Before I go further, this morning we express our deepest sadness and sorrow for the families who lost a precious loved one in the horrific shooting last night in Gilroy, California.  While families were spending time together at a local festival, a wicked murderer opened fire and killed three innocent citizens, including a young child.  We grieve for their families and we ask that God will comfort them with his overflowing mercy and grace.  We’re praying for those who are recovering right now in the hospital.  Some very, very serious injuries.

We thank the brave members of law enforcement — they never let us down — who swiftly killed the shooter.  We reaffirm our national will to answer violence with the courage, determination, and resolve of one American family.  We will continue to work together as communities and as citizens to stop evil, prevent violence, and protect the safety of all Americans.

We’re joined for today’s ceremony by our wonderful Vice President, Mike Pence.  Thank you, Mike, very much.  Thank you.  (Applause.)  Along with many distinguished guests.

I want to begin by recognizing a leader many of you know very well.  On September 11th, he declared, “The city of New York and the United States of America is much stronger than any group of barbaric terrorists…our strength and our willingness to defend ourselves will ultimately prevail.”  And he was right.  A great mayor of the city of New York — our greatest mayor, in my opinion.  Now, what do I know?  (Laughter.)  Rudy Giuliani.  Stand up, Rudy.  (Applause.)  Great job, Rudy.  Great job.  Rudy has got a lot of guts.

Thanks also to Deputy Attorney General Jeffrey Rosen for being here.  Thank you, Jeff.  Thank you very much.  Along with Senator Deb Fischer and Representatives Michael Burgess, Chris Collins, Brian Fitzpatrick, Peter King, John Joyce, Mark Meadows, and Dan Meuser.  Please stand up, fellas.  Please.  (Applause.)  Thank you very much.  Thank you.  Thank you, Peter.

In the wake of the September 11th attacks, courageous Americans raced into smoke, fire, and debris in lower Manhattan, the Pentagon, and a field in Shanksville, Pennsylvania.  The whole world witnessed the might and resilience of our nation in the extraordinary men and women of the New York Fire Department and the New York Police Department, selfless patriots of unmatched character and devotion.  I grew up with them so I can tell you that’s absolutely true.  It’s always nice to really know your subject.  I know that subject.  These are great people.

We also commemorate the heroes of the Port Authority Police.  And I want to thank you all for being here.  Tremendous people.  The first responders from across the country rushed to New York and worked endless days and sleepless nights.  They fought to rescue every person trapped in the rubble, and then searched for months to find the remains of the fallen.

The love and loyalty of our 9/11 responders knew no bounds.  Today, we are deeply honored to be in the presence of more than 60 of these exceptional heroes.  They answered terror with the emotional strength of true American warriors.  Would every 9/11 responder please stand up?  Please, all you first responders.  (Applause.)  Wow.  Great.  Thank you.  Thank you, fellas.  Great-looking group of people you are.  Great-looking group of people.  Thank you very much.  You inspire all of humanity, and you know that.

We’re also greatly moved to have with us families of our fallen heroes.  Our nation owes each of you a profound debt that no words or deeds will ever repay.  But we can and we will keep our nation’s promise to you.

In a few moments, I will sign the 9/11 Victims Compensation Fund.  This law makes permanent the financial support for families who lost precious loved ones as a result of September 11th attacks.  It also provides pensions for those who are suffering from cancer and other illnesses stemming from the toxic debris they were exposed to in the aftermath of the attacks.  Many of those affected were firefighters, police officers, and other first responders.  And I was down there also, but I’m not considering myself a first responder.  But I was down there.  I spent a lot of time down there with you.

Since September 11th, we have lost more than 2,000 first responders and survivors to 9/11-related cancers and illnesses.  Currently, thousands of men and women are battling cancer and other illnesses due to 9/11.  We pledge to stand by the families of those affected, today and every day.  We will stand with you.

I want to thank lawmakers in both parties for working with common purpose to pass this vital and critical legislation.

Here with us for this signing ceremony are the three families whose loved ones are memorialized in the title of this bill.

New York Police Department Detective James Zadroga spent more than 450 hours serving at Ground Zero.  In 2006, James died from a lung disease.  To his father Joseph, and his daughter Tyler Ann, who join us: Detective Zadroga’s heroism will uplift our nation forever.  He won’t be forgotten.  We will always remember what he did for us.  Please stand up.  Please.  Please.  (Applause.)  Thank you.  Thank you very much.

Also present today is the family of East Meadow Volunteer Firefighter Ray Pfeifer.  I know East Meadow very well.  Great place.  Great people.  For eight months, Ray worked constantly at Ground Zero.  In 2017, at the age of 59, he died from cancer.

Here with us today is Ray’s wife Caryn, his daughter Taylor, and his son Terence, now a New York City firefighter.  Please, stand up.  (Applause.)  Good.  Very good.  Thank you.  And I know Ray must be watching over you, looking down right now from heaven, on this beautiful Rose Garden.  Very, very proud of you.  Thank you.  Thank you very much.

The third namesake of the bill is New York City Detective Luis Alvarez.  Last month, his powerful testimony in Congress touched the heart of our nation.  A few days later, he passed from this life into eternity.  We are privileged to have with us Detective Alvarez’s brother Philip and his wife Alaine, and his sons Tyler and Ben.  Please, stand.  Please.  Please.  Thank you.  (Applause.)  Thank you.  Thank you very much.  Thank you very much.

I want each of you to know that America is holding you in the arms of its wonderful, wonderful heart.  And we’re all grieving by your side.  Our whole nation prays and pays tribute to the incredible life and legacy of Detective Alvarez — how hard he worked and how much he suffered.  And we really want to thank him.  He was really something.  People understood it very well.  It’s really great.  Thank you.

We have an obligation, and it’s a sacred obligation, to the families and first responders of 9/11.

Here with us today is Chief John Joyce, former fire chief of the Midtown Manhattan firehouse.  On September 11th, 15 of his men raced into the ashes of hell and gave their lives.  To this day, Chief Joyce still mentors many of their 28 children.

Chief Joyce spent seven months working at Ground Zero.  In 2011, he was diagnosed with cancer.  He has also endured other severe 9/11-related illnesses.  But the Chief is a fighter.  He is definitely a fighter.  As he says, because of this bill, he does not have to fear for the families of his firehouse whose loved ones made the ultimate sacrifice.  Chief Joyce, you have our everlasting gratitude.  Please, Chief.  Thank you.  Good.  (Applause.)  Thank you, Chief.  Thank you for being here.  And say hello to everybody.

To every 9/11 hero, you poured out your heart, your sweat, your soul, and everything you had for your country.  You ran toward the wreckage, into a ball of flames, like, frankly, nobody in this country had ever seen.  You searched for survivors.  You went back day after day and night after night to save lives and return the fallen to their families, to rebuild and recover, and to show the entire world that nothing will ever break America’s spirit.

Over the last two decades, you have endured hardship with amazing grace and incredible grit.  Through it all, you care and you work, and you love, and you will always remember all of those great families.  You lift up our communities and you remind us all what it means to stand united as “one nation under God.”

For your entire lives, you have gone far beyond your duty to us, and today we strive to fulfill our sacred duty to you.

We love you.  We honor you.  And we thank you.  God bless you all.  Thank you.  (Applause.)  Thank you.

Now I’m going to sign this bill into law.  And I don’t know if the stage will hold it, but if it doesn’t, we’re not falling very far.  But I’d like to ask the families and I’d also like to ask the first responders to come up, and we’ll give — we’ll give this stage a shot.  Let’s see how well built.  Made in America.  Let’s see how well built it is.  Okay?  Come on up.

(The bill is signed.)

(Applause.)  Thank you, everybody.  Thank you very much.

Russia,30-04-2009,Dmitry Medvedev,"Speech at Ceremony for Signing Bilateral Documents between the Russian Federation, the Republic of Abkhazia and the Republic of South Ossetia"," Ladies and gentlemen, representatives of the media,

First and foremost of course I would like to say what a great pleasure it is to welcome President of the Republic of Abkhazia Sergei Bagapsh and President of the Republic of South Ossetia Eduard Kokoity to Moscow.

We have just signed agreements on cooperation in protecting the borders of Abkhazia and South Ossetia and on coordination of state security services. It goes without saying that this is an important political act.

These documents are the result of agreements signed some time ago in this very room, treaties on friendship, cooperation and mutual assistance. I am confident that these documents will make a clear contribution to strengthening security in the Caucasus.

One of our key tasks is to be tough and resolute in our opposition to any acts of aggression, terrorism or cross-border crime. The agreements now signed were designed to regulate precisely these issues at both the international level and at the level of the relevant agencies.

I think that neither those present in this room nor those elsewhere can be in any doubt that such threats actually exist. In these circumstances, we would consider any action that could be perceived by Tbilisi as encouraging the remilitarisation of the country or any attempt – a senseless attempt – to strengthen its military capabilities as measures that are in contradiction with the agreements signed in August last year containing the six principles for conflict resolution.

In this context I would also like to say that the NATO exercises scheduled to take place in Georgia between May 6 and June 1 of this year are in effect a blatant provocation, even though our western partners have tried to convince us it is not so. It is impermissible to conduct military exercises in an area of recent combat actions. This is an obvious truth.

I would like to specifically note that any likely negative consequences of these decisions are entirely the responsibility of the individuals who took them and propose to engage in these activities.

While defending the borders of South Ossetia and Abkhazia, we are of course aspiring to achieve the most important goal, the same we have always had: to ensure long-awaited peace in the region. For a long time now people there have grown tired of living in constant fear and in anticipation of attacks, although we must of course say that after the decisions that Russia took the situation has radically changed. Nevertheless, provocation is still possible and should be prevented. People must be granted peaceful life.

We consider the cooperation in protecting state borders of these two republics that are close to us and in developing national border services of Abkhazia and South Ossetia to be a key factor in ensuring the security of state borders and overall security in the region.

The powers for the protection of the borders of these republics, which these agreements have delegated to Russia, will be implemented in strict accordance with the national legislation of Abkhazia and South Ossetia. This is a crucial point and validation of the national sovereignty of the two republics.

Of course the efficiency and timeliness of our actions in this field directly affects the success, development and, ultimately, the prosperity of these two friendly countries.

In the near future, our task is to complete the groundwork laid to define legal relations between the Russian Federation, Abkhazia and South Ossetia. At the moment, we are working on more than 30 sectorial agreements.

I am convinced that quickly preparing, signing and ratifying them where necessary will be the starting point for our strategic partnership in the years, decades and centuries to come, and will of course help resolve a variety of problems that we must deal with so that the people in our countries can live better.

Thank you for your attention. I am glad that this ceremony took place.",President,Dmitry Medvedev,http://en.kremlin.ru/events/president/transcripts/statements/3921,,INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS

Biden, Jr. on the Celebration of Enkutatash","Jill and I send our best wishes for a happy new year to all the people of Ethiopia and Eritrea, and all those around the world celebrating Enkutatash tomorrow, including hundreds of thousands of Americans with Ethiopian or Eritrean heritage.

Ethiopian-Americans and Eritrean-Americans are vital to every aspect of the life of our nation—enriching communities all across the United States—and I know the past year has been difficult for many of you. In addition to the pain and loss caused by COVID-19, the ongoing conflict in Ethiopia may be directly affecting your families and loved ones. We are all deeply concerned by the reports of violence against civilian populations in Ethiopia, and my Administration is engaging in robust diplomacy with our partners throughout the region to peacefully resolve conflicts in the Horn of Africa. I also recognize and appreciate the direct contributions many of you make to strengthen peace and prosperity in the region as members of the Ethiopian and Eritrean Diaspora.

The United States has a deep and long-lasting commitment to the people of the Horn of Africa. We will continue to speak out against violence and the inhumane treatment of any group of people, and we will continue our support for addressing humanitarian needs in the region. We believe Ethiopia, a great and diverse nation, can overcome its current divisions and resolve the ongoing conflict, beginning with a negotiated ceasefire. Building peace will not be easy, but it can and must begin now with dialogue and by seeking unity in our common humanity.

Russia,28-11-2019,Vladimir Putin,CSTO summit,"Friends, colleagues, Mr Jeenbekov,

The presidency is being handed over to Russia, and we would like to invite our partners to focus on the following priorities in our joint work.

First, we believe it is important to continue the implementation of the CSTO Collective Security Strategy to 2025 consistently and as planned. It involves resolving practical issues related to forestalling or reducing common threats and improving security within our countries’ space.

Russia intends to closely cooperate with the CSTO states in order to expand the organisation’s operational capabilities, improving the CSTO collective forces’ combat training, cohesion and mobility.

We will develop and offer our partners a five-year plan for military cooperation within the CSTO until 2025, which we could approve at the next summit.

We believe it is necessary to improve the effectiveness of analysing and forecasting the military-political situation within the CSTO responsibility zone keeping in mind the possibility of more hot spots appearing next to our borders.

In this regard, we believe it is appropriate to step up the CSTO Crisis Response Centre’s activities, including the exchange of operational information.

Of course, we will strive to further strengthen cooperation with our partners in fighting international terrorism and extremism. We believe it important to keep up joint operations to identify and to eliminate international terrorist groups within the CSTO space, their bases, and sources of funding.

We are willing to share our experience of fighting terrorism gained in Syria and to use it in our efforts to improve the CSTO forces’ operational capabilities.

We believe that stepping up CSTO activities in combating drug trafficking is a priority. To this end, we will initiate drafting a revised CSTO anti-drug strategy for 2021–2025, which will contain additional concrete measures designed to curb the production and trade in drugs and to tighten border regulations.

Building up the CSTO peacekeeping capabilities, maintaining the peacekeeping forces’ high combat readiness and increasing the effectiveness of the command should be our top priorities.

We suggest continuing the drafting of regulatory and organisational documents that would make it possible for the CSTO units to participate in UN peacekeeping operations.

Russia will help expand the circle of friends of our organisation through developing cooperation with all the states and international associations that may be interested in doing so. Notably, last year we approved a package of documents opening up the opportunity for granting the status of CSTO observer or partner.

After all the members of the organisation ratify these documents, a substantive dialogue can be opened with the states that are interested in establishing closer contacts with the CSTO.

Friends,

Next year, we will jointly celebrate the 75th anniversary of Victory in the Great Patriotic War. A detailed plan has been agreed upon providing for holding commemorative, social, cultural and educational events in all CSTO countries.

We are looking forward to seeing the leaders of the CSTO member states at the celebrations in Moscow on May 9, 2020, and we are grateful for the support we have been given regarding our idea to have military contingents from all the CSTO member states take part in the Victory Parade on Red Square.

Of course, we focus particularly on making sure that our states continue to proceed from a single position when it comes to distributing objective information about the decisive role of the peoples of the Soviet Union in defeating Nazism.

This month, the relevant committee of the UN General Assembly approved Russia’s draft resolution on combating the glorification of Nazism with 121 states voting in favour. I would like to express my gratitude to all the CSTO members who not only jointly supported the resolution, but also co-authored it.

In closing, I would like to congratulate Kyrgyzstan on its successful CSTO presidency this year and to provide assurances that Russia will ensure continuity in the organisation’s activities, and will keep up the constructive and meaningful work in the spirit of true alliance and partnership.

Colleagues, we will make advance arrangements with you regarding the place and date of the next CSTO Collective Security Council meeting in Russia.

Thank you.",President,Vladimir Putin,http://en.kremlin.ru/events/president/transcripts/statements/62146,,INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS
Russia,20-08-2000,Vladimir Putin,Opening Address at a Meeting with Russian Orthodox Church Hierarchs,"We have decided to change the format of this meeting from a formal reception to a friendly talk. You all understand the reason why. That reason is the appalling tragedy of the Kursk nuclear submarine. With pained heart and with tears in our eyes, we are all watching the terrible events in the Barents Sea. Sailors are doing everything they can to rescue their comrades. Regrettably, it is not we but the events that determine the outcome – yet we will do everything in our power until the very last moment to rescue all those who can be rescued. We will fight for every life, and we will hope for the best.

I thank all those who stand by us in this tragedy we share. I thank the Church too, for your compassion and your prayers.

USA,26-06-2021 00:00,Joe Biden,Statement by President Joe Biden on the Bipartisan Infrastructure Framework,"On Thursday, I reached a historic agreement with a bipartisan group of Senators on a $1.2 trillion plan to transform our physical infrastructure. The plan would make the largest investment in infrastructure in history, the biggest investment in rail since the creation of Amtrak, and the largest investment in transit ever. It would fix roads and bridges, make critical investments in our clean energy future, and help this country compete with China and other economic rivals. It would replace lead water pipes in our schools and houses, and connect every American to high-speed internet. It would create millions of high-paying jobs that could not be outsourced.

In the days since, the primary focus in Washington has not been about the Plan’s scope, scale or provisions—but rather, how it relates to other legislation before Congress: my American Families Plan. The American Families Plan—which would make historic investments in education, health care, child care, and tax cuts for families, coupled with other investments in care for our seniors, housing, and clean energy—has broad support with the American people, but not among Republicans in Congress.

I have been clear from the start that it was my hope that the infrastructure plan could be one that Democrats and Republicans would work on together, while I would seek to pass my Families Plan and other provisions through the process known as reconciliation. There has been no doubt or ambiguity about my intention to proceed this way.

At a press conference after announcing the bipartisan agreement, I indicated that I would refuse to sign the infrastructure bill if it was sent to me without my Families Plan and other priorities, including clean energy. That statement understandably upset some Republicans, who do not see the two plans as linked; they are hoping to defeat my Families Plan—and do not want their support for the infrastructure plan to be seen as aiding passage of the Families Plan. My comments also created the impression that I was issuing a veto threat on the very plan I had just agreed to, which was certainly not my intent.

So to be clear: our bipartisan agreement does not preclude Republicans from attempting to defeat my Families Plan; likewise, they should have no objections to my devoted efforts to pass that Families Plan and other proposals in tandem. We will let the American people—and the Congress—decide.

The bottom line is this: I gave my word to support the Infrastructure Plan, and that’s what I intend to do. I intend to pursue the passage of that plan, which Democrats and Republicans agreed to on Thursday, with vigor. It would be good for the economy, good for our country, good for our people. I fully stand behind it without reservation or hesitation.

Some other Democrats have said they might oppose the Infrastructure Plan because it omits items they think are important: that is a mistake, in my view. Some Republicans now say that they might oppose the infrastructure plan because I am also trying to pass the American Families Plan: that is also a mistake, in my view. I intend to work hard to get both of them passed, because our country needs both—and I ran a winning campaign for President that promised to deliver on both. No one should be surprised that that is precisely what I am doing.

I will ask Leader Schumer to schedule both the infrastructure plan and the reconciliation bill for action in the Senate. I expect both to go to the House, where I will work with Speaker Pelosi on the path forward after Senate action. Ultimately, I am confident that Congress will get both to my desk, so I can sign each bill promptly.

Russia,13-09-2007,Vladimir Putin,Opening Remarks at the Session of the Council for the Implementation of Priority National Projects and Demographic Policy,"Good afternoon, dear colleagues!

Before we start work, I want to say just a word or two about my visit to Chuvashia and coming here to the Belgorod region. We had doubts about how the national projects would go. And the first steps were, indeed, difficult. When we first discussed this idea two and a half years ago of course there were a lot of doubts: would they work effectively and be productive? Were our housing programmes or the ones in agriculture and health just a way of throwing money at problems? Some were afraid that we would be simply doling out money, and that it would go to an unprepared infrastructure and untrained staff, that the government would just waste its money and get no results.

I am very glad that this didn’t happen and that the opposite is true.

Of course, we know and have pointed out that there are problems in the country that are much bigger than those that are addressed by national projects. Moreover, national projects will not help us resolve every problem. As we have said, these are only a catalyst. They are simply a nudge in the right direction, but one that has a number of effects. And the most important result is not even the amount of equipment that we have bought for the health system, for primary health care. It’s not the number of ambulances, although we have fully refitted our ambulance fleet. And it’s not grants, like the ones in the education system, or the new equipment. Nor is it the money devoted to agriculture (here in the Belgorod region 62 billion rubles in loans has been made available).

Actually, it seems to me that the most important result is that people believe that the state cares about them – that’s the first thing.

There’s something else: people have begun to change in relation to those demands that life presents. Eyes are sparkling. They are sparkling, indeed! Yesterday a teacher in Chuvashia who has been learning to use computer technology said to me: ”It’s time for me to retire. But I don’t want to go. It’s so interesting now. Work has become interesting.“ And this is the most important thing. The most important result is that people want to work, and to work efficiently in the jobs they have now.

The demographic project has actually begun to yield some modest results. The trend is small, but it is moving in the right direction, the one we want. This is also encouraging.

We must reflect on what else should be done to ensure that our work in these areas is more efficient, and the whole country must be involved, not just the leading regions. The Belgorod region and Chuvashia are of course the leaders in the national projects. What is most important, very important indeed, is that integrating national projects with these regions’ own development programmes have triggered transformation of the industry structure. The positive results in the Belgorod area in the agriculture industry are based on new technologies and new methods of production.

There are a large number of new agricultural enterprises, a large number. These are not reconditioned structures from the last century. The money hasn’t been thrown away. These are absolutely new, built from scratch, production facilities based on modern technology and new skills. Of course this is good. This affects the life in the rural areas, the qualityl of people’s lives.

In the Chuvash Republic, thanks to modern management techniques, the quality and accessibility of health care have improved. Through the use of smart technology, new equipment and increased training for medical personnel, maternal and neonatal mortality have been reduced by half. Well-designed plans for organising rural schools have resulted in a level of training and equipment that are as good as those in the city. In the rural areas the establishment of educational centres is proceeding apace, and by and large this decision has been vindicated. As the elementary and secondary school teachers said to me yesterday – and I was talking to them on-line in different regions, not just in the Chuvash schools – of course parents want to send their children to the educational centres. We talked a lot about this, and I know the views of those who believe that not every village school should be torn down. That makes sense too, but parents want to send their children to learning centres which offer high levels of expertise. And from which children can actually go on to attend the best universities in the country. In Chuvashia the number of children from rural schools who go on to attend a decent college or university has increased, not by a factor of 10 but a hundredfold! Imagine! This is the result of a combination of uniform state exams for everyone and the availability of educational centres.

Our Council session today is dedicated to the development of national education. The question is how, using the national project mechanisms, to bring about systemic change in educational institutions, how to make them more modern and open to all that is progressive and new.

I want to stress that competition in the national education system has become crucial for our global competitiveness. Today the winner is the one who adapts most quickly to the demands and challenges of a rapidly changing world. It is a world in which technology is constantly changing, the development of innovations is accelerating, and global markets for labour are emerging. Moreover, professional success requires, not knowledge acquired once in a lifetime, but continuous learning. In the foreground is people’s capacity to find their bearings in the vast field of information, the ability to find solutions independently, and implement them successfully.

Without exaggeration, it is the school and vocational system that ensure the future of our country. It is here that the basis of its prosperity and security is formed. Therefore, we must look very seriously at the modernisation of education as a strategic objective.

First and foremost, we need a modern system of educational standards. These must be focused, not only on the reception of knowledge, but on developing the ability to apply it effectively. I believe that we need to attract the best teachers and leaders of innovative educational institutions, including winners of competitions in the national education project, to the development of such standards. Employers, entrepreneurs, business people and those who work in government agencies and social services should all participate in the preparation of standards for higher professional education.

Clearly, the key issue is the quality of teachers. To ensure this, we must provide competitive salaries for teachers. At the same time, we must take into account not only the quantity but also the quality of teaching.

As part of the national programme in a number of regions there was an experiment conducted under the auspices of the Ministry of Education concerning the funding system and pay for those who work in schools. Under the new system the salaries of teachers can be increased by 50% or even 100%. This is noteworthy for schools.

Introducing new methodologies for teaching will also require sophisticated training programmes for teachers. An effective system of external evaluation of the quality of education is also needed.

All these areas must be worked out, not only in the course of the national education project, but continued in the future, as part of the entire education industry.

Further. We have already begun to modernise higher education. As a matter of fact, I am referring to the introduction of a system of various levels of higher education degrees, education credits and targeted capital.

And finally, we need to create effective incentives for universities to improve the quality of their expertise. It is well known that, as part of the national project, we are in the second year of support on a competitive basis of innovative programmes for universities’ development. This has helped to stimulate creative initiatives in the academic audience. And this practice should be made permanent.

In addition, we have begun to modernise the system of financing higher education. The amount of funds allocated to a particular university must depend on the quality and the popularity of their programmes. A growing part of public funding should go to grants for specific projects and programme development.

Such measures would support those educational establishments that set the bar for themselves and their students very high, placing their bets on innovation.

Russian higher education has been worse off than it is now. Even if it’s not exactly booming, one feels the potential for progress. In terms of students –we have about 500 out of every 10,000 people — we are among the world leaders. And we have almost twice as many as countries such as Germany, Britain and Japan.

People rightly believe education to be an integral part of success in life and personal fulfillment. But it is no secret that, given such a high level of interest in education, many are openly taking advantage of the system. And colleagues in higher education will surely understand what I’m talking about. Sometimes our universities seem more like diploma mills than the purveyors of new knowledge. We have already talked about this. To combat this, we need openness and transparency on the part of the universities. Graduates must know who will be teaching them, what they will be learning, how their prospective university is rated in the labour market and, finally, what sort of a career and salary they can count on after university. Universities should take responsibility for the accuracy of this information. Independent ratings can play a valuable role here, as can professional certification of people and educational programmes. They should become an integral part of the external evaluation of the quality of education.

In conclusion, I would like to raise one more subject, namely the development of continuing education. Today the whole area of upgrading skills is growing rapidly, evolving rapidly. There is a real demand for it. However, the quality of such services is still below the standard required to meet today’s demand, let alone tomorrow’s.

I repeat, in the education sphere we need an intelligible and effective public policy, one that will provide everyone in the country with new opportunities for professional growth. This is crucial for the success of Russia’s innovative economy, and for life in a progressive state and society.

Dear colleagues!

I have already talked about my impressions of the people I’ve met, people who are working on national projects in all areas, and by and large, of course, I was seeing the positive examples. On the whole, these industries have many many problems. We must avoid looking at things through rose-coloured glasses. We need to face the truth. There are still so many problems! And we all need to work hard on all these fronts.",President,Vladimir Putin,http://en.kremlin.ru/events/president/transcripts/statements/24534,,DEVELOPMENT
USA,30-04-2016,Barack Obama,"
Weekly Address: It’s Time for the Senate To Do Its Job"," Hi, everybody.  It’s now been 45 days since I nominated Judge Merrick Garland to the Supreme Court.  Judge Garland is a man of experience, integrity, and unimpeachable qualifications.  Judge Garland is someone who Senate Republicans are on record saying is “a man of accomplishment and keen intellect;” a man who’s “honest and capable;” a man whose “reputation is beyond reproach.”  Those are all quotes from Republicans in the Senate.

But so far, most Senate Republicans have refused to even meet with Judge Garland.  Which means they’ve also refused to do their job and hold a hearing on his nomination, or an up-or-down vote.  But they’ve still found time to head home for recess over the next week.

This is an abdication of the Senate’s responsibility.  Every Supreme Court nominee since 1875 who hasn’t withdrawn from the process has received a hearing or a vote.  For over 40 years, there’s been an average of 67 days between a nomination and a hearing.  This time should be no different.  This is not about partisan politics – it’s about upholding the institutions that make our democracy work. 

There’s a reason Judge Garland has earned the respect of people from both political parties.  As a young lawyer, he left a lucrative private firm to work in public service.  He went to oversee the federal response to the Oklahoma City bombing.  For the last 19 years, Judge Garland has served on the D.C. Circuit Court – often called “the Second Highest Court in the Land” – and for the past three years, he’s served as that court’s Chief Judge.  In fact, Judge Merrick Garland has more federal judicial experience than any other Supreme Court nominee in history.  With a brilliant mind, a kind spirit, and a good heart, he has dedicated his life to protecting our rights, and ensuring that the voices of everyday Americans are heard.

So there is absolutely no reason for Republican Senators to deny him the basic courtesy of a hearing and a vote – the same courtesy that has been extended to others.  This refusal to treat a Supreme Court nomination with the seriousness it deserves is what makes people so cynical about Washington.  That’s why poll after poll shows a majority of Americans think Senate Republicans should do their job; give Judge Garland a hearing; and give Judge Garland a vote.

For all of our political differences, Americans understand that what unites us is far greater than what divides us.  And in the middle of a volatile political season, it is more important than ever that we fulfill our duties – in good faith – as public servants.  The Supreme Court must remain above partisan politics.  I’ve done my job – I nominated someone as qualified as Merrick Garland.  Now it’s time for the Senate to do their job.  Give Judge Garland a hearing.  Give Judge Garland an up-or-down vote.  Treat him – and our democracy – with the respect they deserve. 

Thanks for listening, and have a great weekend. ",President,Barack Obama,https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/the-press-office/2016/04/30/weekly-address-its-time-senate-do-its-job,,NATIONALISM
Russia,27-05-2000,Vladimir Putin,Speech at the Congress of the Unity All-Russia Political Movement,"Colleagues and friends,

I am pleased to welcome you here today.

Present in this room are delegates from all 89 constituent entities of the Russian Federation, a high-powered group of people who want to, can and will engage in politics. I welcome you all. But I hope you won’t hold it against me if I extend a special welcome to the 18-man delegation from the Chechen Republic.

You have just taken a responsible step by voting to create a party. I congratulate you on that event.

I am sure you have taken the right decision. First, Unity has had to keep up the momentum and build on every success and move forward. Secondly, reforms, both in the economy and government, need a solid political backing. Russian citizens must have an opportunity to participate in government affairs and be active in the work of the party. So far, unfortunately, not only are our government institutions weak, but our civil society is also weak, as a previous speaker quite rightly said. I absolutely agree with him.

The party’s task is to overcome these weaknesses and draw as many people as possible into its organisations. A political party can only be a partner and a pillar of the government if it contributes to forming the government. We know that Unity has joined this process and it is strongly represented in the State Duma. You have taken an active part in the campaign to elect the President of the Russian Federation. The next stage is local and regional elections.

Political parties so far have played a very modest role in regional elections, as we know only too well. The candidates, for whatever office, try to distance themselves from all parties, and that is not accidental. But there is another snag in store for many candidates. They often fall under the influence of clans and groups that are separated from society and pursue their own corporate interests.

So the building of an effective party system that is open to the people and understood by the people is a national challenge in the full sense of the word.

I must say that as the head of state, I consider it to be one of my main tasks. I will tell you honestly that I dream of the time when these institutions, these instruments are up and running in our country. If we manage to do it and if I manage to contribute to this process, I will believe that I will have fulfilled many of the tasks that face me as President. The survival and competitiveness of our society and state in the historical perspective depends on it. I am absolutely convinced of this.

We want to see the emergence not of “pocket” parties, but parties that actively contribute to the formation of government, promote charismatic leaders capable of creating teams that work effectively and are responsible to society and the state. A constitutional congress cannot accomplish that task. Prolonged and challenging work lies ahead. I would like to tell you that your movement and any other political movements and various parties, even those opposing you, will have the support of the state. But only a party that embarks on this arduous road can have a future.

I would like to say some words about what we will have to do together. We know that the main thing is to overcome poverty and backwardness. There is no more important task for us now and there won’t be any time soon.

Of course, the key to solving these problems is sustained economic growth, but it is also necessary to create political and economic systems that would provide solid protection against political risks. These two processes – achieving political stability and sustained economic development – must go hand-in-hand.

There is yet another long-term challenge that will need to be met if the economy is to develop successfully. It is the building of the state. That is why a package of laws has been drafted and submitted to the Duma aimed at making the country more governable in tune with the times, in strict compliance with the federal laws, protecting the rights of Russian citizens throughout the country’s territory no matter whether they live in Moscow or thousands of kilometres away from the capital.

It is no secret that we often see attempts to establish authoritarian rule and curtail local self-government. That is why medium and small business is not developing and we have seen the appearance of “states within a state” with their own laws that contravene the Russian Constitution and laws. I think it is time to rectify this situation.

Mind you, nobody is challenging the priorities and principles of federalism and the autonomy of regions. God forbid us to embark on that path. But everyone must understand that there are fundamental principles of state and that by violating these principles we erode the foundation of the building which will inevitably collapse, however magnificent and powerful it may look. In fact, the more massive the building, the more likely it will collapse if the foundation is destroyed.

There has to be a balance of interests. It should be reflected in the balance of all the branches and at all levels of power. This is the aim of the package of documents submitted to the State Duma which I have just referred to.

Our actions are aimed at uniting Russia. No one can be allowed to undo our gains in the field of human rights: freedom of business, creative work, freedom of speech. Every Russian citizen should feel secure. Security can be provided only by the state and only through developed institutions of civil society by ensuring privacy, property rights, stable rules and norms of life that are the same for everyone in Russia. This is one of the tasks of the government today. I think this is what ordinary Russian citizens, our voters expect from us.

I understand, and we have heard Sergei Shoigu say in his report, that Unity intends to be a partner of the government. I must say that this imposes obligations on the authorities as well because the authorities feel that they have the support of such a powerful political force, such a party. First of all, we share the responsibility for everything that will happen in the country. As several speakers have said, today you do not claim to be the ruling party. I think this is a fair approach. Attempts to create such parties have been made in Russia’s recent history. They drew support mainly from civil servants, and what is more, top-level civil servants. Let us be frank, in their time these political forces and political entities played a positive role in the life of society and the state, but for a variety of reasons they failed to gain enough authority to become integrated into the system, to strike deep roots in society.

You know that popularity and authority do not come by themselves, they cannot come about by fiat. That is a futile undertaking, as witnessed by the fate and experience of many Russian parties. You, the Unity party, which is only starting, would do well to learn from their experience.

State Duma elections are only your first success that has earned you some trust. It would be a pity if you wasted it; it would be an unpardonable mistake. People must know that the party and its leaders champion their interests, make a difference in the life of the state, change it for the better, and truly respected people join the party in the regions.

But let us be honest: it is always the case that the people who seek to become involved in government are precisely the people who shouldn’t be allowed near government. It has always been that way. I don’t think you will be spared that problem. I am sure Unity will also face that problem. I just want to alert you to this.

Colleagues, among your voters are people of diverse political views, and this is a great asset. It is not a minus, but a plus. It is very important to preserve the unity and consolidation, to find things that unite people who adhere to different views and opinions. Unity and consolidation are the key tasks for the President and for various political forces. I think we no longer have any need for parties committed to revolutionary transformation; we have had enough of them.

Our common task is to achieve a mutual understanding, to take into account the interests of various social forces. Unity has already demonstrated that it can contribute to the consolidation of society, protect the interests of the state as a whole and every Russian citizen individually. What is needed is that every Russian citizen, every individual feel it. If that happens then Unity can be hugely successful. I have no doubt about it. But the road to success, the road to that goal is an arduous one.

I wish you success along that road. I wish you all the best.

Thank you. ",President,Vladimir Putin,http://en.kremlin.ru/events/president/transcripts/statements/21443,,OTHERS
USA,24-04-2021 00:00,Joe Biden,Statement by President Joe Biden on Armenian Remembrance Day,"Each year on this day, we remember the lives of all those who died in the Ottoman-era Armenian genocide and recommit ourselves to preventing such an atrocity from ever again occurring. Beginning on April 24, 1915, with the arrest of Armenian intellectuals and community leaders in Constantinople by Ottoman authorities, one and a half million Armenians were deported, massacred, or marched to their deaths in a campaign of extermination. We honor the victims of the Meds Yeghern so that the horrors of what happened are never lost to history. And we remember so that we remain ever-vigilant against the corrosive influence of hate in all its forms.
 
Of those who survived, most were forced to find new homes and new lives around the world, including in the United States. With strength and resilience, the Armenian people survived and rebuilt their community. Over the decades Armenian immigrants have enriched the United States in countless ways, but they have never forgotten the tragic history that brought so many of their ancestors to our shores. We honor their story. We see that pain. We affirm the history. We do this not to cast blame but to ensure that what happened is never repeated.
 
Today, as we mourn what was lost, let us also turn our eyes to the future—toward the world that we wish to build for our children. A world unstained by the daily evils of bigotry and intolerance, where human rights are respected, and where all people are able to pursue their lives in dignity and security. Let us renew our shared resolve to prevent future atrocities from occurring anywhere in the world. And let us pursue healing and reconciliation for all the people of the world. 
 
The American people honor all those Armenians who perished in the genocide that began 106 years ago today.",President,Joe Biden,https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/04/24/statement-by-president-joe-biden-on-armenian-remembrance-day/,,INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS
USA,05-04-2016,Barack Obama,"
Remarks by the President in Meeting with Combatant Commanders and Joint Chiefs of Staff","Well, good afternoon.  This is one of my regular meetings with Secretary of Defense Carter, General Dunford, and our entire military leadership, including our Joint Chiefs of Staff and our combatant commanders from all around the world.

And these meetings are always an opportunity for me to review our defense strategy broadly, the priorities in the budget that can realize that strategy, and, most importantly, it gives us an opportunity to talk about our incredible men and women in uniform and the sacrifices they make, and the help of the force in making sure we’re doing right by them.  

Secretary Carter spoke earlier today about how we have to make sure that the Department of Defense is fully organized and has all the tools that it needs to meet a wide range of emerging threats.  I am very pleased that our budget agreement that we signed last year allowed us to get some relief out of sequestration.  Those were some harmful cuts on both the defense and the non-defense side.  But because of that relief and building on that, the budget that has been proposed makes sure that we’re investing in our national security, our global leadership, and our economic security here at home.

We’re investing in capabilities that our military needs to deter aggression and defend our security and that of our allies.  And this includes increases in our posture in Europe to reassure our NATO allies in light of particularly increased aggressive actions by Russia.  It allows us to enhance our maritime cooperation in the Asia Pacific.  It allows us to boost cybersecurity, which is going to be an increasing threat that has to be addressed.  It allows us to invest in the future of our force, support our military families, and make sure that our technological edge is maintained relative to forces all around the world.

This will also be an opportunity for us to review the military campaign against ISIL.  And although he is not here -- because today was his retirement ceremony -- I think this is a great opportunity to salute General Lloyd Austin.  He served our nation in uniform for nearly 41 years, including his repeated tours in Iraq.  As Commander of Central Command, he oversaw the operations from Afghanistan to Iraq and our campaign against ISIL.  He did an outstanding job in every single assignment that he received.  We are profoundly grateful to General Austin, his wife Charlene, and the entire Austin family.

Our military campaign against ISIL is now being led by General Votel.  And Joe has brought incredible skill and dedication to his most recent prior assignment, heading up our Special Forces.  We are working to make sure that we’re accelerating the campaign against ISIL.  In Syria and Iraq, ISIL continues to lose ground.  Coalition forces recently severed the main highway between ISIL’s strongholds at Raqqa, Syria and Mosul in Iraq.  And we continue to take on their leadership, their financial networks, their infrastructure.  We are going to squeeze them and we will defeat them.

But as we’ve seen from Turkey to Belgium, ISIL still has the ability to launch serious terrorist attacks.  One of my main messages today is that destroying ISIL continues to be my top priority.  And so we should no longer tolerate the kinds of positioning that is enabled by them having headquarters in Raqqa and Mosul.  We’ve got to keep on putting the pressure on them. 

And obviously, that is not just a military operation.  That is an intelligence and diplomatic effort as well.  And so one of the things we’ll talk about here is how we make sure that we coordinate our military activities with the efforts of our other branches of government.

This will continue to be a difficult fight, but I’m absolutely confident that ISIL will lose.  We will prevail.  And once again, this allows me to say thank you not only to these distinguished members of our armed forces, our core leadership that makes things happen day in and day out, but it also is a good opportunity for me, once again, to say thank you for the incredible men and women in uniform and their families who carry such an enormous burden in order to keep us free and in order to keep us safe. 

Thank you very much, everybody. ",President,Barack Obama,https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/the-press-office/2016/04/05/remarks-president-meeting-combatant-commanders-and-joint-chiefs-staff,,OTHERS
USA,03-12-2013,Barack Obama,"
Remarks by the President on the Affordable Care Act","Thanks to Monica, thanks to everybody standing behind me, and thanks for everybody out there who cares deeply about this issue.  Monica’s story is important because for all the day-to-day fights here in Washington around the Affordable Care Act, it’s stories like hers that should remind us why we took on this reform in the first place.

And for too long, few things left working families more vulnerable to the anxieties and insecurities of today’s economy than a broken health care system.  So we took up the fight because we believe that, in America, nobody should have to worry about going broke just because somebody in their family or they get sick.  We believe that nobody should have to choose between putting food on their kids’ table or taking them to see a doctor.  We believe we’re a better country than a country where we allow, every day, 14,000 Americans to lose their health coverage; or where every year, tens of thousands of Americans died because they didn’t have health care; or where out-of-pocket costs drove millions of citizens into poverty in the wealthiest nation on Earth.  We thought we were better than that, and that’s why we took this on.  (Applause.)

And that’s what’s gotten lost a little bit over the last couple of months.  And our focus, rightly, had to shift towards working 24/7 to fix the website, healthcare.gov, for the new marketplaces where people can buy affordable insurance plans.  And today, the website is working well for the vast majority of users.  More problems may pop up, as they always do when you’re launching something new.  And when they do, we’ll fix those, too.  But what we also know is that after just the first month, despite all the problems in the rollout, about half a million people across the country are poised to gain health care coverage through marketplaces and Medicaid beginning on January 1st -- some for the very first time.  We know that -- half a million people.  (Applause.)  And that number is increasing every day and it is going to keep growing and growing and growing, because we know that there are 41 million people out there without health insurance.  And we know there are a whole bunch of folks out there who are underinsured or don’t have a good deal.  And we know the demand is there and we know that the product on these marketplaces is good and it provides choice and competition for people that allow them, in some cases for the very first time, to have the security that health insurance can provide. 

The bottom line is this law is working and will work into the future.  People want the financial stability of health insurance.  And we’re going to keep on working to fix whatever problems come up in any startup, any launch of a project this big that has an impact on one-sixth of our economy, whatever comes up we’re going to just fix it because we know that the ultimate goal, the ultimate aim, is to make sure that people have basic security and the foundation for the good health that they need.

Now, we may never satisfy the law’s opponents.  I think that’s fair to say.  Some of them are rooting for this law to fail -- that’s not my opinion, by the way, they say it pretty explicitly.  (Laughter.)  Some have already convinced themselves that the law has failed, regardless of the evidence.  But I would advise them to check with the people who are here today and the people that they represent all across the country whose lives have been changed for the better by the Affordable Care Act.

The other day I got a letter from Julia Walsh in California.  Earlier this year, Julia was diagnosed with leukemia and lymphoma.  “I have a lot of things to worry about,” she wrote.  “But thanks to the [Affordable Care Act], there are lots of things I do not have to worry about, like…whether there will be a lifetime cap on benefits, [or] whether my treatment will bankrupt my family…I can’t begin to tell you how much that peace of mind means...”  That’s what the Affordable Care Act means to Julia.  She already had insurance, by the way, but because this law banned lifetime limits on the care you or your family can receive, she’s never going to have to choose between providing for her kids or getting herself well -- she can do both. 

Sam Weir, a doctor in North Carolina, emailed me the other day.  “The coming years will be challenging for all of us in family medicine,” he wrote.  “But my colleagues and I draw strength from knowing that beginning with the new year the preventive care many of our current patients have been putting off will be covered and the patients we have not yet seen will finally be able to get the care that they have long needed.”  That’s the difference that the Affordable Care Act will make for many of Dr. Weir’s patients.  Because more than 100 million Americans with insurance have gained access to recommended preventive care like mammograms, or colonoscopies, or flu shots, or contraception to help them stay healthy -- at no out-of-pocket cost.  (Applause.)

At the young age of 23, Justine Ula is battling cancer for the second time.  And the other day, her mom, Joann, emailed me from Cleveland University Hospital where Justine is undergoing treatment.  She told me she stopped by the pharmacy to pick up Justine’s medicine.  If Justine were uninsured, it would have cost her $4,500.  But she is insured -- because the Affordable Care Act has let her and three million other young people like Monica gain coverage by staying on their parents’ plan until they’re 26.  (Applause.)  And that means Justine’s mom, all she had to cover was the $25 co-pay. 

Because of the Affordable Care Act, more than 7 million seniors and Americans with disabilities have saved an average of $1,200 on their prescription medicine.  (Applause.)  This year alone, 8.5 million families have actually gotten an average of $100 back from their insurance company -- you don’t hear that very often -- (laughter) -- because it spent too much on things like overhead, and not enough on their care.  And, by the way, health care costs are rising at the slowest rate in 50 years.  So we’re actually bending the cost of health care overall, which benefits everybody.  (Applause.)

So that’s what this law means to millions of Americans.  And my main message today is:  We’re not going back.  We’re not going to betray Monica, or Julia, or Sam, or Justine, or Joann.  (Applause.)  I mean, that seems to be the only alternative that Obamacare’s critics have is, well, let’s just go back to the status quo -- because they sure haven’t presented an alternative.  If you ask many of the opponents of this law what exactly they’d do differently, their answer seems to be, well, let’s go back to the way things used to be.

Just the other day, the Republican Leader in the Senate was asked what benefits people without health care might see from this law.  And he refused to answer, even though there are dozens in this room and tens of thousands in his own state who are already on track to benefit from it.  He just repeated “repeal” over and over and over again.  And obviously we’ve heard that from a lot of folks on that side of the aisle.

Look, I’ve always said I will work with anybody to implement and improve this law effectively.  If you’ve got good ideas, bring them to me.  Let’s go.  But we’re not repealing it as long as I’m President and I want everybody to be clear about that.  (Applause.) 

We will make it work for all Americans.  If you don’t like this law -- (applause) -- so, if despite all the millions of people who are benefitting from it, you still think this law is a bad idea then you’ve got to tell us specifically what you’d do differently to cut costs, cover more people, make insurance more secure.  You can’t just say that the system was working with 41 million people without health insurance.  You can’t just say that the system is working when you’ve got a whole bunch of folks who thought they had decent insurance and then when they got sick, it turned out it wasn’t there for them or they were left with tens of thousands of dollars in out-of-pocket costs that were impossible for them to pay.

Right now, what that law is doing -- (baby talks.)  Yes, you agree with me.  (Laughter.)  Right now, what this law is doing is helping folks and we’re just getting started with the exchanges, just getting started with the marketplaces.  So we’re not going to walk away from it.  If I’ve got to fight another three years to make sure this law works, then that’s what I’ll do.  That’s what we’ll do.  (Applause.)

But what’s important for everybody to remember is not only that the law has already helped millions of people but that there are millions more who stand to be helped.  And we’ve got to make sure they know that.  And I’ve said very clearly that our poor execution in the first couple months on the website clouded the fact that there are a whole bunch of people who stand to benefit.  Now that the website is working for the vast majority of people, we need to make sure that folks refocus on what’s at stake here, which is the capacity for you or your families to be able to have the security of decent health insurance at a reasonable cost through choice and competition on this marketplace and tax credits that you may be eligible for that can save you hundreds of dollars in premium costs every month, potentially.

So we just need people to -- now that we are getting the technology fixed -- we need you to go back, take a look at what’s actually going on, because it can make a difference in your lives and the lives of your families.  And maybe it won’t make a difference right now if you’re feeling healthy, but I promise you, if somebody in your family -- heaven forbid -- gets sick, you’ll see the difference.  And it will make all the difference for you and your families.

So I’m going to need some help in spreading the word -- I’m going to need some help in spreading the word.  I need you to spread the word about the law, about its benefits, about its protections, about how folks can sign up.  Tell your friends.  Tell your family.  Do not let the initial problems with the website discourage you because it’s working better now and it’s just going to keep on working better over time.  Every day I check to make sure that it’s working better.  (Laughter.)  And we’ve learned not to make wild promises about how perfectly smooth it’s going to be at all time, but if you really want health insurance through the marketplaces, you’re going to be able to get on and find the information that you need for your families at healthcare.gov.

So if you’ve already got health insurance or you’ve already taken advantage of the Affordable Care Act, you’ve got to tell your friends, you’ve got to tell your family.  Tell your coworkers.  Tell your neighbors.  Let’s help our fellow Americans get covered.  Let’s give every American a fighting chance in today’s economy.

Thank you so much, everybody.  God bless you.  God bless America.  (Applause.)",President,Barack Obama,https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/the-press-office/2013/12/03/remarks-president-affordable-care-act,,DEVELOPMENT

Remarks by the President on Jobs for the Middle Class, 07/30/13","Hello, Chattanooga!  (Applause.)  It is good to be back in Tennessee.  (Applause.)  It’s great to be here at Amazon.  (Applause.) 

I want to thank Lydia for the introduction and sharing her story.  Give Lydia a big round of applause.  (Applause.)  So this is something here.  I just finished getting a tour of just one little corner of this massive facility -- size of 28 football fields.  Last year, during the busiest day of the Christmas rush, customers around the world ordered more than 300 items from Amazon every second, and a lot of those traveled through this building.  So this is kind of like the North Pole of the south right here.  (Applause.)  Got a bunch of good-looking elves here.     

Before we start, I want to recognize your general manager, Mike Thomas.  (Applause.)  My tour guide and your vice president, Dave Clark.  (Applause.)  You've got the Mayor of Chattanooga, Andy Berke.  (Applause.)  And you've got one of the finest gentlemen I know, your Congressman, Jim Cooper.  (Applause.)  So thank you all for being here.

So I’ve come here today to talk a little more about something I was discussing last week, and that’s what we need to do as a country to secure a better bargain for the middle class -– a national strategy to make sure that every single person who's willing to work hard in this country has a chance to succeed in the 21st century economy.  (Applause.) 

Now, you heard from Lydia, so you know -- because many of you went through it -- over the past four and a half years, we’ve been fighting our way back from the worst recession since the Great Depression, and it cost millions of Americans their jobs and their homes and their savings.  And part of what it did is it laid bare the long-term erosion that’s been happening when it comes to middle-class security.  

But because the American people are resilient, we bounced back.  Together, we've righted the ship.  We took on a broken health care system.  We invested in new American technologies to reverse our addiction to foreign oil.  Changed a tax code that had become tilted too much in favor of the wealthy at the expense of working families.  Saved the auto industry, and thanks to GM and the UAW working together, we're bringing jobs back here to America, including 1,800 autoworkers in Spring Hill.  (Applause.)  1,800 workers in Spring Hill are on the job today where a plant was once closed. 

Today, our businesses have created 7.2 million new jobs over the last 40 months.  This year, we’re off to our best private-sector jobs growth since 1999.  We now sell more products made in America to the rest of the world than ever before.  (Applause.)  We produce more renewable energy than ever.  We produce more natural gas than anybody else in the world.  (Applause.)  Health care costs are growing at the slowest rate in 50 years.  Our deficits are falling at the fastest rate in 60 years.  (Applause.)

So thanks to hardworking folks like you, thanks to the grit and resilience of the American people, we’ve been able to clear away some of the rubble from the financial crisis.  We've started to lay a new foundation for a stronger, more durable America -- the kind of economic growth that’s broad-based, the foundation required to make this century another American century. 

But as I said last week, and as any middle-class family will tell you, we’re not there yet.  Even before the financial crisis hit, we were going through a decade where a few at the top were doing better and better, but most families were working harder and harder just to get by.  And reversing that trend should be Washington’s highest priority.  (Applause.)  It’s my highest priority. 

But so far, for most of this year, we’ve seen an endless parade of distractions and political posturing and phony scandals.  And we keep on shifting our way -- shifting our attention away from what we should be focused on, which is how do we strengthen the middle class and grow the economy for everybody.  (Applause.)  And as Washington heads towards yet another budget debate, the stakes couldn’t be higher. 

And that’s why I’m visiting cities and towns like this -– to lay out my ideas for how we can build on the cornerstone of what it means to be middle class in America.  A good job with good wages.  A good education.  (Applause.)  A home to call your own.  (Applause.)  Affordable health care that’s there for you when you get sick.  (Applause.)  A secure retirement even if you’re not rich.  (Applause.)  More chances for folks to earn their way into the middle class as long as they’re willing to work for it.  And, most importantly, the chance to pass on a better future for our kids.  (Applause.)

So I’m doing a series of speeches over the next several weeks, but I came to Chattanooga today to talk about the first and most important cornerstone of middle-class security, and that's a good job in a durable, growing industry.  (Applause.)

It’s hard to get the other stuff going if you don't have a good job.  And the truth is everything I’m going to be talking about over the next several weeks really is about jobs.  Because preparing our children and our workers for the global competition they’ll face, that’s about jobs.  A housing finance system that makes it easier and safer to buy and build new homes, that’s about jobs in the construction industry.  Health care that frees you from the fear of losing everything after you’ve worked so hard, and then having the freedom to maybe start your own business because you know you’ll be able to get health care, that’s about jobs.  And, obviously, retirement benefits speak to the quality of our jobs.

And let me say this, it’s something everybody here understands:  Jobs are about more than just paying the bills.  Jobs are about more than just statistics.  We’ve never just defined having a job as having a paycheck here in America.  A job is a source of pride, is a source of dignity.  It’s the way you look after your family.  (Applause.)  It’s proof that you’re doing the right things and meeting your responsibilities and contributing to the fabric of your community and helping to build the country.  That's what a job is all about.  It’s not just about a paycheck.  It’s not just about paying the bills.  It’s also about knowing that what you’re doing is important, that it counts. 

So we should be doing everything we can as a country to create more good jobs that pay good wages.  Period.  (Applause.)

Now, here’s the thing, Chattanooga, the problem is not that  we don't have ideas about how we could create even more jobs.  We’ve got a lot of ideas out there.  There are plenty of independent economists, plenty of business owners, people from both parties agree on some of the ingredients that we need for creating good jobs.  And you’ve heard them debated again and again over these past few years.  I proposed a lot of these ideas myself.  Just two years ago, I announced the American Jobs Act -- full of ideas that every independent economist said would create more jobs.  Some were passed by Congress.  But I got to admit, most of them weren’t.  Sometimes there were ideas that historically had Republican support and for some reason suddenly Republicans didn’t want to support them anymore.

Putting people back to work rebuilding America’s infrastructure.  Equipping our kids and our workers with the best skills.  Leading the world in scientific research that helps to pave the way for new jobs in new industries.  Accelerating our clean energy and natural gas revolutions.  Fixing a broken immigration system so that American workers aren’t undercut, undermined because some businesses are unscrupulous and hiring folks and not paying them decent wages.  (Applause.) 

Independent economists say immigration reform would boost our economy by more than a trillion dollars.  So we’ve got ideas out there we know can work.  And if we don’t make these investments, if we don’t make these reforms, then we might as well be waving the white flag to the rest of the world, because they’re moving forward.  They’re not slowing down.  China, Germany, India -- they’re going.  And we can’t just sit by and do nothing.  Doing nothing doesn’t help the middle class.  (Applause.) 

So today, I came here to offer a framework that might help break through some of the political logjam in Washington and try to get Congress to start moving on some of these proven ideas.  But let me briefly outline some of the areas I think we need to focus on if we want to create good jobs, with good wages, in durable industries -– areas that will fuel our future growth.

Number one -- jobs in American manufacturing.  (Applause.)  Over the past four years, for the first time since the 1990s, the number of manufacturing jobs in America hasn’t gone down, it’s actually gone up.  (Applause.)  So the trend lines are good; now we’ve got to build on that progress.  I want to offer new incentives for manufacturers not to ship jobs overseas, but to bring them back here to America.  (Applause.)  I want new tax credits so communities hit hardest by plant closures can attract new investment.  (Applause.) 

In my State of the Union address, I asked Congress to build on a successful pilot program we’ve set up.  We want to create not just 15 manufacturing innovation institutes that connect businesses and universities and federal agencies to help communities left behind by global competition to become centers of high-tech jobs.  Today, I’m asking Congress to build on this bipartisan support and triple that number from 15 to 45 -- these hubs -- where we’re getting businesses, universities, communities all to work together to develop centers of high-tech industries all throughout the United States that allow us to be at the forefront of the next revolution of manufacturing.  I want it made here in the United States of America.  I don't want that happening overseas.  (Applause.)

Number two -- I talked about this last week -- jobs rebuilding our infrastructure.  I look at this amazing facility and you guys, you don't miss a beat.  I mean, you've got these packages coming out.  You've got dog food and Kindles and beard trimmers.  (Laughter.)  I mean, there's all kinds of stuff around here.  But once it's packed up, it's got to get to the customer.  And how quickly and how dependably it gets to the customer depends on do we have good roads, do we have good bridges, do we have state-of-the-art airports. 

We've got about $2 trillion of deferred maintenance here in this country.  So let’s put more construction workers back on the job doing the work America needs done.  (Applause.)  These are vital projects that Amazon needs, businesses all across the country need, like widening Route 27 here in Chattanooga -- (applause) -- deepening the Jacksonville Port that I visited last week.  These are projects vital to our national pride.

We're going to be breaking ground this week at the St. Louis Arch.  Congress should pass what I've called my “Fix-It-First” plan to put people to work immediately on our most urgent repairs, like the 100,000 bridges that are old enough to qualify for Medicare.  That will create good middle-class jobs right now.  (Applause.)  And we should partner with the private sector to upgrade what businesses like Amazon need most.  We should have a modern air traffic control system to keep planes running on time.  We should have modern power grids and pipelines to survive a storm.  We should have modern schools to prepare our kids for the jobs of tomorrow.  (Applause.)  

Number three, we need to keep creating good jobs in energy -- in wind and solar and natural gas.  Those new energy sources are reducing energy costs.  They're reducing dangerous carbon pollution.  They're reducing our dependence on foreign oil.  So now is not the time to gut investments in American technology.  Now is the time to double down on renewable energy and biofuels and electric vehicles, and to put money into the research that will shift our cars and trucks off oil for good.  (Applause.) 

And let me tell you, cheaper costs of natural gas is a huge boost to our businesses here in America, so we should develop it even more.  We've got to do it in a way that protects our air and our water for our children and future generations.  But we can do that.  We've got the technology to do it. 

Number four, we've got to export more.  We want to send American goods all around the world.  (Applause.)  A year ago, I signed a new trade agreement with Korea, because they were selling a lot of Hyundais here, but we weren't selling a lot of GM cars over there.  Since we signed that deal, our Big Three automakers are selling 18 percent more cars in Korea than they were.  (Applause.) 

So now we've got to help more of our businesses do the same thing.  I’m asking Congress for the authority to negotiate the best trade deals possible for our workers, and combine it with robust training and assistance measures to make sure our workers have the support and the skills they need for this new global competition.  And we're going to have to sharpen our competitive edge in the global job marketplace. 

Two years ago, we created something called SelectUSA.  This is a coordinated effort to attract foreign companies looking to invest and create jobs here in the United States.  And today I’m directing my Cabinet to expand these efforts.  And this October, I’m going to bring business leaders from around the world, and I'm going to connect them to state leaders and local leaders like your mayor who are ready to prove there’s no better place to do business than right here in the United States of America.  (Applause.)

Number five -- let's do more to help the more than 4 million long-term unemployed Americans that are out there.  (Applause.)  One of the problems is a lot of folks, they lose their jobs during this really bad recession through no fault of their own.  They've got what it takes to fill that job opening, but because they’ve been out of work so long employers won’t even give their application a fair look.  (Applause.) 

So I’m challenging CEOs to do more to get these Americans back on their feet.  And I'm going to bring together the CEOs and companies that are putting in place some of the best practices for recruiting and training and hiring workers who have been out of work for a long time, but want the chance to show that they're ready to go back to work.  (Applause.) 

And at the same time, I'm calling on our businesses to do more for their workers.  (Applause.)  Amazon is a great example of what's possible.  What you're doing here at Amazon with your Career Choice Program pays 95 percent of the tuition for employees who want to earn skills in fields with high demand -- not just, by the way, jobs here at Amazon, but jobs anywhere --  computer-aided design or nursing.  I talked to Jeff Bezos yesterday, and he was so proud of the fact that he wants to see every employee at Amazon continually upgrade their skills and improve.  And if they've got a dream they want to pursue, Amazon wants to help them pursue it.  (Applause.) 

That’s the kind of approach that we need from America's businesses.  Offering training programs, health care, retirement plans, paying better wages -- that’s not just the right thing to do, it’s actually good for your bottom line.  A recent study shows that when a company makes the list of the “100 Best Companies to Work for in America,” its share price outperforms its competitors, because the stock market and investors, they know if a company has employees that are motivated and happy, that business is more likely to succeed.  (Applause.)  That business is more likely to succeed.

And because nobody who works full-time in America should have to live in poverty, I'm going to keep on making the case and fighting for the fact that we need to raise our minimum wage, because right now it's in lower terms than it was when Ronald Reagan took office.  (Applause.)  When folks have more money in their pockets, that’s good for Amazon; it means your customers have a little more money.  They can order a little more of that protein powder.  (Laughter.)  I noticed a lot of folks were ordering protein power.  Everybody is trying to get bulked up.  (Laughter.) 

So here's -- those are some of the ideas that we're out there, we're promoting.  We're not lacking for ideas, we're just lacking action, especially out of Washington.  (Applause.)

For most of the past two years, Washington has just taken its eye off the ball when it comes to the middle class.  And I'll tell you -- look, there are a growing number of -- the good news is there are a growing number of Republican senators who are trying to work with Democrats to get some stuff done.  (Applause.)  That’s good news. 

The bad news is that rather than keep our focus on what should be our priority -- which is growing our economy and creating good middle-class jobs -- we’ve seen a certain faction of Republicans in Congress hurt a fragile recovery by saying that they wouldn’t pay the very bills that Congress racked up in the first place, threatening to shut down the people’s government if they can’t get rid of Obamacare.  Instead of reducing our deficits with a scalpel to get rid of programs we don’t need, but keep vital investments that we do, this same group has kept in place this meat cleaver called the sequester that is just slashing all kinds of important investments in education and research and our military.  All the things that are needed to make this country a magnet for good middle-class jobs, those things are being cut. 

And these moves don’t just hurt our economy in the long term; they hurt our middle class right now.  The independent Congressional Budget Office estimates that the cuts that are being made right now in Washington will cost our economy 750,000 jobs this year; 900,000 fewer jobs next year.  And a lot of the jobs at risk are at small businesses that contract with our military or our federal agencies.

Over the past four years, another 700,000 workers at the federal, state, and local levels of government have lost their jobs.  These are cops and firefighters, and about half of them are people who work in our schools.  Those are real jobs.  It doesn’t help a company like Amazon when a teacher or a cop or a firefighter loses their job.  They don't have money to place an order.  That's hundreds of thousands of customers who have less money to spend. 

If those layoffs had not happened, if public sector employees grew like they did in the past two recessions, the unemployment rate would be 6.5 percent instead of 7.5 percent.  Our economy would be much better off, and the deficit would still be going down because we’d be getting more tax revenue.

So the point is, if Washington spent as much time and energy these past two years figuring out how to grow our economy and grow our middle class as it’s spent manufacturing crises in pursuit of a cut-at-all-costs approach to deficits, we’d be much better off.  We’d be much better off.  (Applause.)

And it’s not like we don't have to cut our deficits.  As a share of the economy, we’ve cut our deficits by nearly half since I took office.  Half.  And they're projected to go down even further, but there’s a right way to do it and a wrong way to do it.  And we should do it in a way that actually helps middle-class families instead of hurts them.  (Applause.)

I’ve told Republicans that if they’re serious about a balanced, long-term fiscal plan that replaces harmful budget cuts that would get serious about a long-term plan that prevents those 900,000 jobs from being lost, that helps grow the economy, that helps the middle class, I am ready to go.  But we can't lose sight of our North Star.  We can’t allow an impasse over long-term fiscal challenges to distract us from what the middle class needs right now.

So here’s the bottom line:  If folks in Washington really want a grand bargain, how about a grand bargain for middle-class jobs?  (Applause.)  How about a grand bargain for middle-class jobs?  

I don't  want to go through the same old arguments where I propose an idea and the Republicans just say, no, because it’s my idea.  (Applause.)  So I’m going to try offering something that serious people in both parties should be able to support:  a deal that simplifies the tax code for our businesses and creates good jobs with good wages for middle-class folks who work at those businesses. 

Right now, everybody knows this -- our tax code is so riddled with loopholes and special interest tax breaks that a lot of companies who are doing the right thing and investing in America pay 35 percent in their taxes; corporations who have got fancy accountants and stash their money overseas, they pay little or nothing in taxes.  That’s not fair, and it's not good for the economy here. 

So I'm willing to simplify our tax code -- closes those loopholes, ends incentives to ship jobs overseas, lowers the rate for businesses that are creating jobs right here in America, provides tax incentives for manufacturers that bring jobs home to the United States.  Let's simplify taxes for small business owners, give them incentives to invest so they can spend less time filling out complicated forms, more time expanding and hiring. 

I'm willing to do all that that should help businesses and help them grow.  But if we’re going to give businesses a better deal, then we're also going to have to give workers a better deal, too.  (Applause.)  I want to use some of the money that we save by closing these loopholes to create more good construction jobs with infrastructure initiatives that I already talked about.  We can build a broader network of high-tech manufacturing hubs that leaders from both parties can support.  We can help our community colleges arm our workers with the skills that a global economy demands.  All these things would benefit the middle class right now and benefit our economy in the years to come.

So, again, here’s the bottom line:  I’m willing to work with Republicans on reforming our corporate tax code, as long as we use the money from transitioning to a simpler tax system for a significant investment in creating middle-class jobs.  That’s the deal.  (Applause.) 

And I'm just going to keep on throwing ideas out there to see if something takes.  (Laughter.)  I'm going to lay out my ideas to give the middle class a better shot.  But now it's time for Republicans to lay out their ideas. 

If they’ve got a better plan to bring back more manufacturing jobs here to Tennessee and around the country, then let them know -- let me know.  I want to hear them.  If they've got a better plan to create jobs rebuilding our infrastructure or to help workers earn the high-tech skills that they need, then they should offer up these ideas. 

But I've got to tell you, just gutting our environmental protection, that’s not a jobs plan.  Gutting investments in education, that’s not a jobs plan.  They keep on talking about this -- an oil pipeline coming down from Canada that’s estimated to create about 50 permanent jobs -- that’s not a jobs plan.  Wasting the country’s time by taking something like 40 meaningless votes to repeal Obamacare is not a jobs plan.  That’s not a jobs plan.  (Applause.) 

So let's get serious.  Look, I want to tell everybody here the truth.  And you know, look, I know that the politics for Obama aren't always great in Tennessee.  I understand that.  But I want everybody to just hear the honest truth.  I've run my last campaign, so I don't need to spin.  (Applause.) 

And here's the truth -- there are no gimmicks that create jobs.  There are no simple tricks to grow the economy.  Growing the economy, making sure that the middle class is strong is like getting in shape.  You can't just go on the muffin and doughnut diet and the latest fad and lose weight.  You've got to work out and you've got to eat better.  Well, the same is true for our economy.  The same is true for helping the middle class.

We've got to have a serious, steady, long-term American strategy to reverse the long-term erosion of middle-class security and give everybody a fair shot.  (Applause.)  And we know what we have to do.  It involves education.  It involves infrastructure.  It involves research.  It involves good energy policy.  And we just have to stay at it -- more good jobs that pay decent wages, a better bargain for the middle class, an economy that grows from the middle out.  That's got to be our focus. 

We can't be getting into a whole bunch of fads and pretend like you roll back Obamacare and suddenly all these jobs are going to be created, because the middle class was struggling before I came into office.  (Applause.)  The middle class was losing ground before I came into office.  (Applause.)  Jobs were getting shipped overseas before Obamacare was in place.  So we've got to be honest.  We've got to be honest about the challenges we face, but also the opportunities that are out there. 

And that's what I'm going to be focused on not just for the next few months.  I'm going to be focused for every one of the 1,270 days I've got left in my presidency on how to make sure that we've got more opportunity and more security for everybody who is willing to work hard in this country.  That's where I believe America needs to go.  (Applause.)  And we can do it if we work together, Chattanooga.  Let's get to work. 

Thank you very much, everybody.  God bless you.  God bless the United States of America.  ",President,Barack Obama,https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/the-press-office/2013/07/30/remarks-president-jobs-middle-class-073013,,DEVELOPMENT

STATEMENTS AND RELEASES
February 10, 2021

Dear Madam Speaker: (Dear Madam President:)

Pursuant to the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701 et seq.) (IEEPA), I hereby report that I have issued an Executive Order (the “order”) declaring a national emergency with respect to the unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States posed by the situation in Burma.  The order responds to the February 1, 2021, coup in Burma by targeting the military and its leaders, their business interests, and their close family members.  The order holds to account those responsible for unjustly arresting and detaining government leaders, politicians, human rights defenders, journalists, and religious leaders; rejecting the will of the people of Burma as expressed in elections held in November 2020; and undermining the country’s democratic transition and the rule of law.

The order would authorize the blocking of property and interests in property of any foreign person determined by the Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the Secretary of State:

to operate in the defense sector of the Burmese economy or any other sector of the Burmese economy as may be determined by the Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the Secretary of State;
to be responsible for or complicit in, or to have directly or indirectly engaged or attempted to engage in, any of the following:
actions or policies that undermine democratic processes or institutions in Burma;
actions or policies that threaten the peace, security, or stability of Burma;
actions or policies that prohibit, limit, or penalize the exercise of freedom of expression or assembly by people in Burma, or that limit access to print, online, or broadcast media in Burma; or
the arbitrary detention or torture of any person in Burma or other serious human rights abuse in Burma;
to be or have been a leader or official of:
the military or security forces of Burma, or any successor entity to any of the foregoing;
the Government of Burma on or after February 2, 2021;
an entity that has, or whose members have, engaged in any activity described in subsection (a)(ii) of the order relating to the leader’s or official’s tenure; or
an entity whose property and interests in property are blocked pursuant to the order as a result of activities related to the leader’s or official’s tenure;
to be a political subdivision, agency, or instrumentality of the Government of Burma;
to be a spouse or adult child of any person whose property and interests in property are blocked pursuant to the order;
to have materially assisted, sponsored, or provided financial, material, or technological support for, or goods or services to or in support of any person whose property and interests in property are blocked pursuant to the order; or
to be owned or controlled by, or to have acted or purported to act for or on behalf of, directly or indirectly, the military or security forces of Burma or any person whose property and interests in property are blocked pursuant to the order.
In addition, the order suspends entry into the United States of any noncitizen determined to meet one or more of the above criteria.

I have delegated to the Secretary of the Treasury the authority, in consultation with the Secretary of State, to take such actions, including the promulgation of rules and regulations, and to employ all powers granted to the President by IEEPA as may be necessary to carry out the purposes of the order.  I have delegated to the Secretary of State, in consultation with the Secretary of Homeland Security, the authority to implement the order as it applies to visas.  I have delegated to the Secretary of Homeland Security, in consultation with the Secretary of State, the authority to implement the order as it applies to the entry into the United States of noncitizens.  All executive departments and agencies are directed to take all appropriate measures within their authority to carry out the provisions of the order.

I am enclosing a copy of the Executive Order I have issued.",President,Joe Biden,https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/02/11/a-letter-to-the-speaker-of-the-house-of-representatives-and-the-president-of-the-senate/,,OTHERS
USA,31-08-2013,Barack Obama,"
Weekly Address: Commemorating Labor Day"," Hi, everybody.  This Labor Day weekend, as we gather with family and friends, we’ll also come together as a nation to honor some of our own – the working men and women of America who, across the generations, built this country up and helped make us who we are today. 

On Monday, we’ll celebrate that proud history.  We’ll pay tribute to the values working Americans embody – hard work; responsibility; sacrifice; looking out for one another.  And we’ll recommit ourselves to their cause; to securing for them a better bargain so that everyone who works hard in America has a chance to get ahead.

See, over the past four and a half years, we’ve fought our way back from the worst recession of our lifetimes.  And thanks to the grit and resilience of the American people, we’ve begun to lay a foundation for stronger, more durable economic growth.  But as any working family will tell you, we’re not where we need to be.   

For over a decade, working Americans have seen their wages and incomes stagnate, even as corporate profits soar and the pay of a fortunate few explodes.  For even longer than that, inequality has steadily risen; the journey of upward mobility has become harder.  And in too many communities across this country, the shadow of poverty continues to cast a pall over our fellow citizens.

Reversing that trend needs to be Washington’s highest priority.  It’s certainly mine.  That’s why, over the past month, I’ve traveled all across America, laying out my ideas for how we can build on the cornerstones of what it means to be middle class.  A good job that pays a good wage.  A good education.  A home of your own.  Health care when you get sick.  A secure retirement even if you’re not rich.  And more chances for folks to earn their way into the middle class as long as they’re willing to work for it.   

The truth is, it’s not going to be easy to reverse the forces that have conspired – for decades – against working Americans.  But if we take a few bold steps – and if Washington is able to come together with common purpose and common resolve – we’ll get there.  Our economy will keep getting stronger and more Americans will be able to join the ranks of the middle-class. 

So this Labor Day, while you’re out there grilling in the backyard, or taking that final trip for the summer, I hope you’ll also take a moment to reflect on the many contributions of our working men and women.  For generations, it was the great American middle class that made our economy the envy of the world.  And as long as I’m President, I’m going to keep fighting to make sure that happens again.

Thanks, and have a great weekend.",President,Barack Obama,https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/the-press-office/2013/08/31/weekly-address-commemorating-labor-day,,OTHERS
United Kingdom,07-Dec-16,Theresa May,Prime Minister's speech to the Gulf Co-operation Council 2016,"I am delighted to be here in Manama, following in the footsteps of His Royal Highness the Prince of Wales in celebrating 2 centuries of relations between Bahrain and the United Kingdom. And I am very grateful to His Majesty King Hamad for bestowing on me this special honour – to be invited to address the leaders of the Gulf Co-operation Council. We meet at a time of great change in the world. Political change, economic change, social change; in almost every sphere we are confronted with change and uncertainty. The risks to our shared security are growing and evolving, as terrorists operate across national borders to plot attacks against our people; as new threats emerge from the malevolent use of the internet, and as certain states continue to act in ways that undermine stability in your region – undermining, in turn, our own security in the West and further reinforcing the need for all of us to work together. We, in the West, face the challenge of trying to manage those forces of globalisation that have in recent times left some of our people behind. Here in the Gulf you, too, are facing the challenges of securing jobs and opportunities for your peoples and building what I call an economy that works for everyone. In this uncertain world, people are searching for direction and leadership and we have a responsibility to provide it. I believe it is more than a responsibility. For if we work together, it is also an unparalleled opportunity to show that we understand the scale of the change people need; understand truly what lies behind it; and most importantly of all; that we as leaders are trusted to deliver. One of the prevailing sentiments in all my conversations with GCC leaders over the last 5 months since I became Prime Minister has been this sense that in challenging times, you turn to your oldest and most dependable friends. That is the spirit in which I come here today. We have a rich history on which to build. From the very first treaties, in the mid-17th century, which saw the East India Company reach agreements on British trade and a military presence in Oman, to our deep partnership as Cold War allies, the UK has been proudly at the forefront of a relationship between the Gulf and the West that has been the bedrock of our shared prosperity and security. And as the United Kingdom leaves the European Union, I am determined that we should seize the opportunity to get out into the world and to shape an even bigger global role for my country: yes, to build new alliances but more importantly, to go even further in working with old friends, like our allies here in the Gulf, who have stood alongside us for centuries. There has never been a more important, or more challenging time to do so. In the face of growing extremism and radicalisation, not unique to this region but here in its most egregious form; in the face of threats to the rules-based order which has underpinned not just our shared security but also the foundations for our shared prosperity, the UK stands here today seeking not just to reaffirm a relationship that is of great historic value but to renew a partnership that is absolutely fundamental to our shared future. So in accepting the honour of addressing GCC leaders, I seek not just to offer a message of continuity, but to begin to build a bold new chapter in our co-operation; not to develop a transactional relationship but rather to forge a strategic relationship, a relationship based on true partnership and an enduring commitment between our countries and our peoples; a relationship through which together we can meet these great challenges to our shared security and prosperity, and grab this opportunity to build an exciting future for the generations that follow us. So let me set out some of the ways in which the UK will step up its relationship with the GCC. And let me start with security. Gulf security is our security Gulf security is our security. Extremists plotting terror attacks here in this region are not only targeting the Gulf but, as we have seen, targeting the streets of Europe too. Whether we are confronting the terrorism of Al Qaeda or the murderous barbarity of Daesh, no country is a more committed partner for you in this fight than the United Kingdom. Today UK servicemen and women are putting their lives on the line at the heart of the international mission against Daesh in Iraq and Syria. We are making progress. And as we are seeing with the current operations in Mosul, the days of Daesh as an occupying force are numbered. Through our close co-operation on counter-terrorism we are succeeding in foiling terrorist plots and a range of threats against citizens in all our countries. For example, intelligence we have received in the past from Saudi Arabia has saved potentially hundreds of lives in the UK. And by focusing not just on violent extremism, but on the whole spectrum of extremism, violent and non-violent, at home and abroad, we are not just going after the terrorists but working to address the causes of this terrorist threat by targeting the ideology of extremism and all those who seek to spread it. As we address new threats to our security, so we must also continue to confront state actors whose influence fuels instability in the region. So I want to assure you that I am clear-eyed about the threat that Iran poses to the Gulf and the wider Middle East. The UK is fully committed to our strategic partnership with the Gulf and working with you to counter that threat. We secured a deal which has neutralised the possibility of Iran acquiring nuclear weapons for over a decade. It has already seen Iran remove 13,000 centrifuges together with associated infrastructure and eliminate its stock of 20% enriched uranium. That was vitally important for regional security. But we must also work together to push back against Iran’s aggressive regional actions, whether in Lebanon, Iraq, Yemen, Syria or in the Gulf itself. We must also continue to work together to achieve a just and comprehensive settlement to the Israeli-Palestinian issue, building on efforts such as the Arab Peace Initiative and harnessing the influence of all of us around this table to bring together those with a stake in a lasting peace, built around a 2-state solution. This remains fundamental to the long-term security and prosperity of the whole Middle East. In recent years we have retained the ability to defend our mutual interests when threatened by deploying UK assets to the region, as we did when Saddam Hussein invaded Kuwait, and as we are continuing to do with HMS Ocean – which I visited yesterday – as it begins its deployment here in Bahrain. But as part of the renewed relationship that I want to forge with you, the United Kingdom will make a more permanent and more enduring commitment to the long-term security of the Gulf. We will invest in hard power, with over £3 billion of defence spending in the region over the next decade, spending more on defence in the Gulf than in any other region of the world. Through the construction of HMS Jufair, and thanks to the generosity of the Kingdom of Bahrain, we will create a permanent presence in the region, the first such facility east of Suez since 1971, with more British warships, aircraft and personnel deployed on operations in the Gulf than in any other part of the world. At the same time, a regional land training hub in Oman is establishing a permanent British army presence in the region. And I am delighted to announce that Saif Sareea 3 will take place in Oman in 2018 – the largest UK-Omani exercise for 15 years. We will also go further in deepening our defence co-operation through a new Strategic Partnership between the UK and the GCC, supporting the development of your defence capacity and capability, including for humanitarian operations and crisis response planning. As part of this we will establish a new British Defence Staff in Dubai to co-ordinate our regional activities and, here in Bahrain, we will embed a dedicated military officer with the Ministry of Interior bomb disposal unit to provide bomb scene management support and training. We will establish a new Joint Working Group on Counter-Terrorism and Border Security and a new National Security Dialogue at GCC level to protect critical national infrastructure, facilitate faster intelligence sharing on suspected foreign terrorist fighters and implement traveller screening systems to detect terrorists attempting to pass through any GCC airport. And because we know that our enemies are increasingly using the internet against us, we will use our expertise in cyber security technologies to build our resilience, and that of our international partners. So we are appointing world-leading cyber experts with extensive backgrounds in delivering cyber security in the UK to provide focused advice to Gulf States on developing your own capacity – as well as a new Cyber Industry Representative based in the region who will build links between cyber sectors in the UK and the Gulf. In all of these ways, I am determined that the UK will be at the forefront of a wider Western effort to step up our defence and security partnership. Not just to provide greater stability and security to the region but also to protect the rules-based order that has been so fundamental to our shared prosperity. When I think of the growth of this region over the past 50 years, from the transformation of Dubai to the position of the Gulf as the UK’s third largest export market, I never forget that the bedrock of this prosperity and stability has been the relationship between the Gulf and the West. Now, in this period of uncertainty, is the time to recommit to this relationship. That is why I am here – to signal my commitment to this relationship and to build on the foundations of our continued partnership in security and prosperity for decades to come. Your prosperity is our prosperity For just as Gulf security is our security, so your prosperity is also our prosperity. Already the Gulf is a special market for the United Kingdom. Last year alone, trade between the UK and GCC was worth more than £30 billion. At the same time Gulf investment in the UK is helping to regenerate cities from Aberdeen to Teeside, and from Manchester to London. I am determined that we should do everything possible to build on this and elevate our trade and investment to an even more ambitious level. So I will continue the work that the UK has been leading over the past 3 years to make London one of the great capitals of Islamic finance anywhere in the world. And as Britain leaves the European Union so we intend to take a leap forward, to look outwards and seek to become the most committed and most passionate advocate of free trade in the world. For free trade makes us all richer. It creates jobs. It increases investment. It improves productivity. It transforms living standards and creates opportunities for all of our citizens. And nowhere is that more important than here with our friends and allies in the Gulf. So first, I am delighted that we agreed yesterday to set up a new Joint Working Group to examine how we can unblock remaining barriers to trade and take steps to further liberalise our economies for the benefit of our mutual prosperity. For example, we have just reached a new agreement with Saudi Arabia to allow British businesses to obtain 5-year multiple entry visas for the first time, creating new opportunities for more bilateral business. And we have agreed that in March next year, the UK will host an event on Gulf national transformation and economic diversification plans at the Mansion House – for centuries, a home of finance and trade at the heart of the City of London. These steps are exactly the sort of measures that we can pursue together to advance everything that is possible from business and trade for the benefit of all of our economies and therefore all of our citizens. Second, I can confirm that the UK will take part in Dubai’s Expo 2020 continuing the tradition started in Britain with The Great Exhibition of the Works of Industry of All Nations in Hyde Park in 1851. Dubai 2020 will offer an enormous commercial opportunity. There will be over 180 nations taking part with more than 25 million visitors expected – from the world’s top business leaders to its biggest investors. It is an opportunity which I am determined we should seize together. And third, I want these talks at official level to pave the way for an ambitious trade arrangement for when the UK has left the EU. And I want us to be imaginative about the scale and reach of this. I want us to explore whether in this dynamic and diverse market, we could forge a new trade arrangement for the whole of the Gulf area. I want to leave no-one in any doubt about the scale of my ambition or the extent of my determination to establish the strongest possible trading relationships between the UK and the Gulf. Building societies that work for all Just as we take every possible step to break down the barriers that are restricting our trade and prosperity; it is also important that we continue the work to bring our peoples together and to ensure that the benefits of greater prosperity are shared by all. In Britain I have talked about the need to create a country that works for everyone. In doing so, I have set out Britain’s great global opportunity to lead the way in managing the unintended negative forces of globalisation so that large segments of our society are not left behind; and so we restore trust between citizens and institutions. Just as we face some major economic and social challenges in the West, so in your own economies you also face the challenge of helping to secure jobs and opportunities for your peoples. We all recognise that there is some way to go before we can say that these economies really work for everyone. But I have been encouraged by recent economic and social reforms you have taken forward and by the bold vision set out by all of the Gulf States for more fundamental and lasting change, most recently with Saudi Arabia’s vision for 2030. We in the UK are determined to continue to be your partner of choice as you embed international norms and see through the reforms which are so essential for all of your people. And this is only possible because the strength of the relationship between our countries, and the respect that we have for each other, enables us to speak frankly and honestly as friends. Together we can meet the challenges of these changing times and secure greater prosperity and security. But to do so will require more than an occasional meeting or a visit every few years. It will require a strengthening of relationships between our countries at every level. So I look forward to the next chapter of the Manama Dialogue run by the UK’s International Institute for Strategic Studies which the Foreign Secretary will attend later this week. This vital strategic relationship between the UK and the Gulf – a partnership steeped in so much history and so full of potential for our future – now demands even more concentrated efforts. That is why I want to continue the hugely positive discussions we are having this week in this first ever UK-GCC dialogue at leader level. I am delighted that you have agreed to make this an annual event. And I look forward to welcoming you to London next year. Conclusion In the face of some of the greatest challenges to our security and our prosperity, we will succeed together. We will succeed through our continued commitment to the rules-based order on which our prosperity has been built. And we will succeed by deepening our security co-operation, expanding our trade and working harder than ever to build economies and societies that work for everyone. I believe there has never been a more important moment for us to get this right. And under my leadership, Britain will play its full part in delivering on that vision.

USA,16-07-2014,Barack Obama,"
Remarks by the President on Foreign Policy"," Good afternoon, everybody.  I want to briefly discuss the important actions we’re taking today in support of Ukraine.  Before I do, I want to take a few minutes to update the American people on some pressing foreign policy challenges that I reviewed with Secretary Kerry this afternoon.

First of all, I thanked Secretary Kerry and our outstanding civilian and military leaders in Afghanistan for their success in helping to break the impasse over the presidential election there.  Thanks to their efforts and, of course, thanks to the Afghans and the courage of the two candidates, both of whom I spoke to last week, the candidates have agreed to abide by the results of a comprehensive and internationally supervised audit that will review all the ballots, and to form a unity government.  If they keep their commitments, Afghanistan will witness the first democratic transfer of power in the history of that nation. 

This progress will honor both candidates who have put the interests of a united Afghanistan first, the millions of Afghans who defied threats in order to vote, and the service of our troops and civilians who have sacrificed so much.  This progress reminds us that even as our combat mission in Afghanistan ends this year, America’s commitment to a sovereign, united, and democratic Afghanistan will endure –- along with our determination that Americans are never again threatened by terrorists inside of Afghanistan.

Second, John updated me on the negotiations with Iran over its nuclear program.  Over the last six months, Iran has met its commitments under the interim deal we reached last year -- halting the progress of its nuclear program, allowing more inspections and rolling back its more dangerous stockpile of nuclear material.  Meanwhile, we are working with our P5-plus-1 partners and Iran to reach a comprehensive agreement that assures us that Iran’s program will, in fact, be peaceful and that they won’t obtain a nuclear weapon. 

Based on consultations with Secretary Kerry and my national security team, it’s clear to me that we have made real progress in several areas and that we have a credible way forward.  But as we approach a deadline of July 20th under the interim deal, there are still some significant gaps between the international community and Iran, and we have more work to do.  So over the next few days, we’ll continue consulting with Congress -- and our team will continue discussions with Iran and our partners –- as we determine whether additional time is necessary to extend our negotiations.

Third, we continue to support diplomatic efforts to end the violence between Israel and Hamas.  As I’ve said repeatedly, Israel has a right to defend itself from rocket attacks that terrorize the Israeli people.  There is no country on Earth that can be expected to live under a daily barrage of rockets.  And I’m proud that the Iron Dome system that Americans helped Israel develop and fund has saved many Israeli lives.

But over the past two weeks, we’ve all been heartbroken by the violence, especially the death and injury of so many innocent civilians in Gaza —- men, women and children who were caught in the crossfire.  That’s why we have been working with our partners in the region to pursue a cease-fire -- to protect civilians on both sides.  Yesterday, Israel did agree to a cease-fire.  Unfortunately, Hamas continued to fire rockets at civilians, thereby prolonging the conflict.

But the Israeli people and the Palestinian people don’t want to live like this.  They deserve to live in peace and security, free from fear.  And that’s why we are going to continue to encourage diplomatic efforts to restore the cease-fire, and we support Egypt’s continued efforts to bring this about.  Over the next 24 hours we’ll continue to stay in close contact with our friends and parties in the region, and we will use all of our diplomatic resources and relationships to support efforts of closing a deal on a cease-fire.  In the meantime, we’re going to continue to stress the need to protect civilians -- in Gaza and in Israel –- and to avoid further escalation.

Finally, given its continued provocations in Ukraine, today I have approved a new set of sanctions on some of Russia’s largest companies and financial institutions. Along with our allies, with whom I’ve been coordinating closely the last several days and weeks, I’ve repeatedly made it clear that Russia must halt the flow of weapons and fighters across the border into Ukraine; that Russia must urge separatists to release their hostages and support a cease-fire; that Russia needs to pursue internationally-mediated talks and agree to meaningful monitors on the border.  I’ve made this clear directly to Mr. Putin.  Many of our European partners have made this clear directly to Mr. Putin.  We have emphasized our preference to resolve this issue diplomatically but that we have to see concrete actions and not just words that Russia, in fact, is committed to trying to end this conflict along the Russia-Ukraine border.  So far, Russia has failed to take any of the steps that I mentioned.  In fact, Russia’s support for the separatists and violations of Ukraine’s sovereignty has continued.

On top of the sanctions we have already imposed, we are therefore designating selected sectors of the Russian economy as eligible for sanctions.  We are freezing the assets of several Russian defense companies.  And we are blocking new financing of some of Russia’s most important banks and energy companies.  These sanctions are significant, but they are also targeted -- designed to have the maximum impact on Russia while limiting any spillover effects on American companies or those of our allies. 

Now, we are taking these actions in close consultation with our European allies, who are meeting in Brussels to agree on their next steps.  And what we are expecting is that the Russian leadership will see, once again, that its actions in Ukraine have consequences, including a weakening Russian economy and increasing diplomatic isolation. 

Meanwhile, we’re going to continue to stand with the Ukrainian people as they seek to determine their own future.  Even in the midst of this crisis, they have made remarkable progress these past few months.  They held democratic elections, they elected a new president, they’re pursuing important reforms, and they signed a new association agreement with the European Union.  And the United States will continue to offer our strong support to Ukraine to help stabilize its economy and defend its territorial integrity because -- like any people -- Ukrainians deserve the right to forge their own destiny.  

So in closing, I’ll point out the obvious.  We live in a complex world and at a challenging time.  And none of these challenges lend themselves to quick or easy solutions, but all of them require American leadership.  And as Commander-in-Chief, I’m confident that if we stay patient and determined, that we will, in fact, meet these challenges. 

Thanks very much.",President,Barack Obama,https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/the-press-office/2014/07/16/remarks-president-foreign-policy,,INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS

Remarks by the President in Address to European Youth","Thank you so much.  Thank you.  (Applause.)  Please, please have a seat.  Good evening.  Goede avond.  Bonsoir.  Guten abend.  (Applause.)  Thank you, Laura, for that remarkable introduction.  Before she came out she told me not to be nervous.  (Laughter.)  And I can only imagine -- I think her father is in the audience, and I can only imagine how proud he is of her.  We're grateful for her work, but she’s also reminding us that our future will be defined by young people like her.

Your Majesties, Mr. Prime Minister, and the people of Belgium -- on behalf of the American people, we are grateful for your friendship.  We stand together as inseparable allies, and I thank you for your wonderful hospitality.  I have to admit it is easy to love a country famous for chocolate and beer.  (Laughter.)   

Leaders and dignitaries of the European Union; representatives of our NATO Alliance; distinguished guests:  We meet here at a moment of testing for Europe and the United States, and for the international order that we have worked for generations to build.

Throughout human history, societies have grappled with fundamental questions of how to organize themselves, the proper relationship between the individual and the state, the best means to resolve inevitable conflicts between states.  And it was here in Europe, through centuries of struggle -- through war and Enlightenment, repression and revolution -- that a particular set of ideals began to emerge:  The belief that through conscience and free will, each of us has the right to live as we choose.  The belief that power is derived from the consent of the governed, and that laws and institutions should be established to protect that understanding.  And those ideas eventually inspired a band of colonialists across an ocean, and they wrote them into the founding documents that still guide America today, including the simple truth that all men -- and women -- are created equal.

But those ideals have also been tested -- here in Europe and around the world.  Those ideals have often been threatened by an older, more traditional view of power.  This alternative vision argues that ordinary men and women are too small-minded to govern their own affairs, that order and progress can only come when individuals surrender their rights to an all-powerful sovereign. Often, this alternative vision roots itself in the notion that by virtue of race or faith or ethnicity, some are inherently superior to others, and that individual identity must be defined by “us” versus “them,” or that national greatness must flow not by what a people stand for, but by what they are against.

In many ways, the history of Europe in the 20th century represented the ongoing clash of these two sets of ideas, both within nations and among nations.  The advance of industry and technology outpaced our ability to resolve our differences peacefully, and even among the most civilized of societies, on the surface we saw a descent into barbarism. 

This morning at Flanders Field, I was reminded of how war between peoples sent a generation to their deaths in the trenches and gas of the First World War.  And just two decades later, extreme nationalism plunged this continent into war once again -- with populations enslaved, and great cities reduced to rubble, and tens of millions slaughtered, including those lost in the Holocaust.

It is in response to this tragic history that, in the aftermath of World War II, America joined with Europe to reject the darker forces of the past and build a new architecture of peace.  Workers and engineers gave life to the Marshall Plan. Sentinels stood vigilant in a NATO Alliance that would become the strongest the world has ever known.  And across the Atlantic, we embraced a shared vision of Europe -- a vision based on representative democracy, individual rights, and a belief that nations can meet the interests of their citizens through trade and open markets; a social safety net and respect for those of different faiths and backgrounds. 

For decades, this vision stood in sharp contrast to life on the other side of an Iron Curtain.  For decades, a contest was waged, and ultimately that contest was won -- not by tanks or missiles, but because our ideals stirred the hearts of Hungarians who sparked a revolution; Poles in their shipyards who stood in Solidarity; Czechs who waged a Velvet Revolution without firing a shot; and East Berliners who marched past the guards and finally tore down that wall. 

Today, what would have seemed impossible in the trenches of Flanders, the rubble of Berlin, or a dissident’s prison cell -- that reality is taken for granted.  A Germany unified.  The nations of Central and Eastern Europe welcomed into the family of democracies.  Here in this country, once the battleground of Europe, we meet in the hub of a Union that brings together age-old adversaries in peace and cooperation.  The people of Europe, hundreds of millions of citizens -- east, west, north, south -- are more secure and more prosperous because we stood together for the ideals we share.

And this story of human progress was by no means limited to Europe.  Indeed, the ideals that came to define our alliance also inspired movements across the globe among those very people, ironically, who had too often been denied their full rights by Western powers.  After the Second World War, people from Africa to India threw off the yoke of colonialism to secure their independence.  In the United States, citizens took freedom rides and endured beatings to put an end to segregation and to secure their civil rights.  As the Iron Curtain fell here in Europe, the iron fist of apartheid was unclenched, and Nelson Mandela emerged upright, proud, from prison to lead a multiracial democracy.  Latin American nations rejected dictatorship and built new democracies, and Asian nations showed that development and democracy could go hand in hand.

Young people in the audience today, young people like Laura, were born in a place and a time where there is less conflict, more prosperity and more freedom than any time in human history. But that’s not because man’s darkest impulses have vanished.  Even here, in Europe, we’ve seen ethnic cleansing in the Balkans that shocked the conscience.

The difficulties of integration and globalization, recently amplified by the worst economic crisis of our lifetimes, strained the European project and stirred the rise of a politics that too often targets immigrants or gays or those who seem somehow different. 

While technology has opened up vast opportunities for trade and innovation and cultural understanding, it’s also allowed terrorists to kill on a horrifying scale.  Around the world, sectarian warfare and ethnic conflicts continue to claim thousands of lives.  And once again, we are confronted with the belief among some that bigger nations can bully smaller ones to get their way -- that recycled maxim that might somehow makes right.

So I come here today to insist that we must never take for granted the progress that has been won here in Europe and advanced around the world, because the contest of ideas continues for your generation.  And that’s what’s at stake in Ukraine today.  Russia’s leadership is challenging truths that only a few weeks ago seemed self-evident -- that in the 21st century, the borders of Europe cannot be redrawn with force, that international law matters, that people and nations can make their own decisions about their future.

To be honest, if we defined our interests narrowly, if we applied a cold-hearted calculus, we might decide to look the other way.  Our economy is not deeply integrated with Ukraine’s. Our people and our homeland face no direct threat from the invasion of Crimea.  Our own borders are not threatened by Russia’s annexation.  But that kind of casual indifference would ignore the lessons that are written in the cemeteries of this continent.  It would allow the old way of doing things to regain a foothold in this young century.  And that message would be heard not just in Europe, but in Asia and the Americas, in Africa and the Middle East. 

And the consequences that would arise from complacency are not abstractions.  The impact that they have on the lives of real people -- men and women just like us -- have to enter into our imaginations.  Just look at the young people of Ukraine who were determined to take back their future from a government rotted by corruption -- the portraits of the fallen shot by snipers, the visitors who pay their respects at the Maidan.  There was the university student, wrapped in the Ukrainian flag, expressing her hope that “every country should live by the law.”  A postgraduate student, speaking of her fellow protestors, saying, “I want these people who are here to have dignity.”  Imagine that you are the young woman who said, “there are some things that fear, police sticks and tear gas cannot destroy.”

We’ve never met these people, but we know them.  Their voices echo calls for human dignity that rang out in European streets and squares for generations.  Their voices echo those around the world who at this very moment fight for their dignity. These Ukrainians rejected a government that was stealing from the people instead of serving them, and are reaching for the same ideals that allow us to be here today.

None of us can know for certain what the coming days will bring in Ukraine, but I am confident that eventually those voices -- those voices for human dignity and opportunity and individual rights and rule of law -- those voices ultimately will triumph.  I believe that over the long haul, as nations that are free, as free people, the future is ours.  I believe this not because I’m naïve, and I believe this not because of the strength of our arms or the size of our economies, I believe this because these ideals that we affirm are true; these ideals are universal.

Yes, we believe in democracy -- with elections that are free and fair; and independent judiciaries and opposition parties; civil society and uncensored information so that individuals can make their own choices.  Yes, we believe in open economies based on free markets and innovation, and individual initiative and entrepreneurship, and trade and investment that creates a broader prosperity.  And, yes, we believe in human dignity -- that every person is created equal, no matter who you are, or what you look like, or who you love, or where you come from.  That is what we believe.  That’s what makes us strong.

And our enduring strength is also reflected in our respect for an international system that protects the rights of both nations and people -- a United Nations and a Universal Declaration of Human Rights; international law and the means to enforce those laws.  But we also know that those rules are not self-executing; they depend on people and nations of goodwill continually affirming them.  And that’s why Russia’s violation of international law -- its assault on Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity -- must be met with condemnation.  Not because we’re trying to keep Russia down, but because the principles that have meant so much to Europe and the world must be lifted up. 

Over the last several days, the United States, Europe, and our partners around the world have been united in defense of these ideals, and united in support of the Ukrainian people. Together, we’ve condemned Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, and rejected the legitimacy of the Crimean referendum.  Together, we have isolated Russia politically, suspending it from the G8 nations and downgrading our bilateral ties.  Together, we are imposing costs through sanctions that have left a mark on Russia and those accountable for its actions.  And if the Russian leadership stays on its current course, together we will ensure that this isolation deepens.  Sanctions will expand.  And the toll on Russia’s economy, as well as its standing in the world, will only increase.

And meanwhile, the United States and our allies will continue to support the government of Ukraine as they chart a democratic course.  Together, we are going to provide a significant package of assistance that can help stabilize the Ukrainian economy, and meet the basic needs of the people.  Make no mistake:  Neither the United States, nor Europe has any interest in controlling Ukraine.  We have sent no troops there.  What we want is for the Ukrainian people to make their own decisions, just like other free people around the world.

Understand, as well, this is not another Cold War that we’re entering into.  After all, unlike the Soviet Union, Russia leads no bloc of nations, no global ideology.  The United States and NATO do not seek any conflict with Russia.  In fact, for more than 60 years, we have come together in NATO -- not to claim other lands, but to keep nations free.  What we will do -- always -- is uphold our solemn obligation, our Article 5 duty to defend the sovereignty and territorial integrity of our allies.  And in that promise we will never waver; NATO nations never stand alone.

Today, NATO planes patrol the skies over the Baltics, and we’ve reinforced our presence in Poland.  And we’re prepared to do more.  Going forward, every NATO member state must step up and carry its share of the burden by showing the political will to invest in our collective defense, and by developing the capabilities to serve as a source of international peace and security.

Of course, Ukraine is not a member of NATO -- in part because of its close and complex history with Russia.  Nor will Russia be dislodged from Crimea or deterred from further escalation by military force.  But with time, so long as we remain united, the Russian people will recognize that they cannot achieve security, prosperity and the status that they seek through brute force.  And that’s why, throughout this crisis, we will combine our substantial pressure on Russia with an open door for diplomacy.  I believe that for both Ukraine and Russia, a stable peace will come through de-escalation -- direct dialogue between Russia and the government of Ukraine and the international community; monitors who can ensure that the rights of all Ukrainians are protected; a process of constitutional reform within Ukraine; and free and fair elections this spring.

So far, Russia has resisted diplomatic overtures, annexing Crimea and massing large forces along Ukraine’s border.  Russia has justified these actions as an effort to prevent problems on its own borders and to protect ethnic Russians inside Ukraine.  Of course, there is no evidence, and never has been, of systemic violence against ethnic Russians inside of Ukraine.  Moreover, many countries around the world face similar questions about their borders and ethnic minorities abroad, about sovereignty and self-determination.  These are tensions that have led in other places to debate and democratic referendums, conflicts and uneasy co-existence.  These are difficult issues, and it is precisely because these questions are hard that they must be addressed through constitutional means and international laws so that majorities cannot simply suppress minorities, and big countries cannot simply bully the small.

In defending its actions, Russian leaders have further claimed Kosovo as a precedent -- an example they say of the West interfering in the affairs of a smaller country, just as they’re doing now.  But NATO only intervened after the people of Kosovo were systematically brutalized and killed for years.  And Kosovo only left Serbia after a referendum was organized not outside the boundaries of international law, but in careful cooperation with the United Nations and with Kosovo’s neighbors.  None of that even came close to happening in Crimea.

Moreover, Russia has pointed to America’s decision to go into Iraq as an example of Western hypocrisy.  Now, it is true that the Iraq War was a subject of vigorous debate not just around the world, but in the United States as well.  I participated in that debate and I opposed our military intervention there.  But even in Iraq, America sought to work within the international system.  We did not claim or annex Iraq’s territory.  We did not grab its resources for our own gain.  Instead, we ended our war and left Iraq to its people and a fully sovereign Iraqi state that could make decisions about its own future.

Of course, neither the United States nor Europe are perfect in adherence to our ideals, nor do we claim to be the sole arbiter of what is right or wrong in the world.  We are human, after all, and we face difficult choices about how to exercise our power.  But part of what makes us different is that we welcome criticism, just as we welcome the responsibilities that come with global leadership. 

We look to the East and the South and see nations poised to play a growing role on the world stage, and we consider that a good thing.  It reflects the same diversity that makes us stronger as a nation and the forces of integration and cooperation that Europe has advanced for decades.  And in a world of challenges that are increasingly global, all of us have an interest in nations stepping forward to play their part -- to bear their share of the burden and to uphold international norms.

So our approach stands in stark contrast to the arguments coming out of Russia these days.  It is absurd to suggest -- as a steady drumbeat of Russian voices do -- that America is somehow conspiring with fascists inside of Ukraine or failing to respect the Russian people.  My grandfather served in Patton’s Army, just as many of your fathers and grandfathers fought against fascism. We Americans remember well the unimaginable sacrifices made by the Russian people in World War II, and we have honored those sacrifices.

Since the end of the Cold War, we have worked with Russia under successive administrations to build ties of culture and commerce and international community not as a favor to Russia, but because it was in our national interests.  And together, we’ve secured nuclear materials from terrorists.  We welcomed Russia into the G8 and the World Trade Organization.  From the reduction of nuclear arms to the elimination of Syria’s chemical weapons, we believe the world has benefited when Russia chooses to cooperate on the basis of mutual interests and mutual respect. 

So America, and the world and Europe, has an interest in a strong and responsible Russia, not a weak one.  We want the Russian people to live in security, prosperity and dignity like everyone else -- proud of their own history.  But that does not mean that Russia can run roughshod over its neighbors.  Just because Russia has a deep history with Ukraine does not mean it should be able to dictate Ukraine’s future.  No amount of propaganda can make right something that the world knows is wrong.

In the end, every society must chart its own course. America’s path or Europe’s path is not the only ways to reach freedom and justice.  But on the fundamental principle that is at stake here -- the ability of nations and peoples to make their own choices -- there can be no going back.  It’s not America that filled the Maidan with protesters -- it was Ukrainians.  No foreign forces compelled the citizens of Tunis and Tripoli to rise up -- they did so on their own.  From the Burmese parliamentarian pursuing reform to the young leaders fighting corruption and intolerance in Africa, we see something irreducible that all of us share as human beings -- a truth that will persevere in the face of violence and repression and will ultimately overcome.

For the young people here today, I know it may seem easy to see these events as removed from our lives, remote from our daily routines, distant from concerns closer to home.  I recognize that both in the United States and in much of Europe there’s more than enough to worry about in the affairs of our own countries.  There will always be voices who say that what happens in the wider world is not our concern, nor our responsibility.  But we must never forget that we are heirs to a struggle for freedom.  Our democracy, our individual opportunity only exists because those who came before us had the wisdom and the courage to recognize that our ideals will only endure if we see our self-interest in the success of other peoples and other nations. 

Now is not the time for bluster.  The situation in Ukraine, like crises in many parts of the world, does not have easy answers nor a military solution.  But at this moment, we must meet the challenge to our ideals -- to our very international order -- with strength and conviction.

And it is you, the young people of Europe, young people like Laura, who will help decide which way the currents of our history will flow.  Do not think for a moment that your own freedom, your own prosperity, that your own moral imagination is bound by the limits of your community, your ethnicity, or even your country.  You’re bigger than that.  You can help us to choose a better history.  That’s what Europe tells us.  That’s what the American experience is all about.

I say this as the President of a country that looked to Europe for the values that are written into our founding documents, and which spilled blood to ensure that those values could endure on these shores.  I also say this as the son of a Kenyan whose grandfather was a cook for the British, and as a person who once lived in Indonesia as it emerged from colonialism.  The ideals that unite us matter equally to the young people of Boston or Brussels, or Jakarta or Nairobi, or Krakow or Kyiv.

In the end, the success of our ideals comes down to us -- including the example of our own lives, our own societies.  We know that there will always be intolerance.  But instead of fearing the immigrant, we can welcome him.  We can insist on policies that benefit the many, not just the few; that an age of globalization and dizzying change opens the door of opportunity to the marginalized, and not just a privileged few.  Instead of targeting our gay and lesbian brothers and sisters, we can use our laws to protect their rights.  Instead of defining ourselves in opposition to others, we can affirm the aspirations that we hold in common.  That’s what will make America strong.  That’s what will make Europe strong.  That’s what makes us who we are.

And just as we meet our responsibilities as individuals, we must be prepared to meet them as nations.  Because we live in a world in which our ideals are going to be challenged again and again by forces that would drag us back into conflict or corruption.  We can’t count on others to rise to meet those tests.  The policies of your government, the principles of your European Union, will make a critical difference in whether or not the international order that so many generations before you have strived to create continues to move forward, or whether it retreats.

And that’s the question we all must answer -- what kind of Europe, what kind of America, what kind of world will we leave behind.  And I believe that if we hold firm to our principles, and are willing to back our beliefs with courage and resolve, then hope will ultimately overcome fear, and freedom will continue to triumph over tyranny -- because that is what forever stirs in the human heart.

Thank you very much.  (Applause.)",President,Barack Obama,https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/the-press-office/2014/03/26/remarks-president-address-european-youth,,INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS
Russia,27-11-2000,Vladimir Putin,Excerpts from a Speech at the 5th National Congress of Judges,"You are about to discuss some acute and truly pressing problems. They include complicated legal problems and the practical problems of the judiciary system. Most of them are relevant to the improvement of the court system.

The court is not just the sphere of your professional activity. It is a state institution whose work directly affects the fate of millions of people.

The judiciary is one of the three constitutional branches of power. The Constitution says in black and white that the courts in the Russian Federation, like the President, the Federal Assembly and the Government, exercise state power in the country. And we have to be able to make effective use of this huge power. Use it in a way that enhances the authority of the Government and trust on the part of the people. And in general, to the judiciary must enhance the prestige of the country.

Serious shifts and important changes have taken place in recent years in the sphere of state development and the emergence of democratic institutions and in the economy. Changes have taken place in the judiciary system. Our task today is to look at the new qualities that system has acquired and what still hinders its development. Without it we cannot move forward. It is not surprising that the problems of the judiciary attract keen public interest and attention.

The courts influence all aspects of the life of society. Their competence covers all the affairs of the state without exception, everything that has to do with the rights, freedoms and interests of the ordinary citizen.

Any person may sooner or later face a court ruling, and what is more, a court ruling that may change his or her life. So we all want our courts to deliver justice that is “swift, right and fair”.

Today many Russian citizens turn to the courts. We know what they are letting themselves in for. You know it better than any of us. Is justice ever swift? Everybody knows that many cases drag on for years. And as our predecessors used to say, very often justice “languishes in court”.

Besides, court proceedings cost money, often a lot of money. I am concerned about citizens above all. They are required to pay. So, not everyone can afford to seek redress in court. The time has come to envisage budget financing of legal defence services to help those who cannot afford to pay their lawyers. In any case, that duty should cover a larger number of people.

Obviously, your workload is not light. The courts handle more than 5 million civilian, more than a million criminal and nearly 2 million administrative offence cases every year. Arbitration courts are just as heavily loaded.

The workload of judges has increased by three times in the last six years. It exceeds all norms and sometimes is the cause of judicial errors and superficial or careless handling of cases.

Failure to meet the deadlines for considering cases is the most acute issue, as I have already said. At present, 3,226 people have been in pre-trial detention for between one and two years awaiting a ruling. Four hundred people have been in pre-trial detention for two to three years and 41 people have been awaiting trial for more than three years. Explanations of course can be found. But that does not make it any easier for the people awaiting a verdict.

The institution of justices of the peace may go some way to solve this problem. But the justices of the peace at present exist only in 33 regions in the country. And they are understaffed, they have only 19.5% of the statutory staff. And in the metropolises that process has not even started. It is odd and lamentable because there are more opportunities there and the load on judges is too heavy.

Obviously, there are not enough judges in our country, their number falls short of the needs of the state. But you know as well as I do that there are many vacancies. Most lawyers, unfortunately, are not exactly eager to become judges.

And this is not only because of the low salaries or “bad laws”. The prestige of the profession is not yet high enough. And yet quite recently, when I was finishing university, we were all eager to become judges, it was a very prestigious profession.

Of course, financing of the courts is a challenge for the Government and we are well aware of it. This year, the programme of financing the judiciary system has practically been fulfilled. Many acute issues that interfered with the judges’ work have been solved.

Salaries are paid regularly. At any rate, they are regularly sent by the Finance Ministry to the corresponding agencies. We try to increase salaries. A couple of days ago a decree was signed to raise the salaries of judges and prosecutors by 1.2 times.

Next year, we will continue to strengthen the financial base of the judiciary system, to improve the financial position of judges. The financing target should be increased by a third.

But if one considers the reform of the judiciary only in terms of the material outlays, it will remain stalled for a long time.

Speaking about the main result of the reform of the judiciary, I would like to stress that in spite of any problems, including those I mentioned earlier, an independent judiciary exists in Russia. We can and must record this fact. The basic parameters of the concept of the judiciary reform have been met.

Russia has a Constitutional Court and statutory courts in the regions of the Federation, general jurisdiction courts, military and arbitration courts. Just recently we marked the third anniversary of the recreation of the institution of court bailiffs. We have trial by jury, if only in several regions. We have 1,066 justices of the peace who administer justice.

We have started restoring the judiciary system in the Chechen Republic. That is a very important step. And I very much hope that it will help to normalise the situation in that region of Russia.

Of course, our judiciary system still has many flaws, both chronic and newly acquired. But this is no reason for proposing “another sweeping and radical” restructuring of the system. I think it is more useful – from the practical and the national points of view – to complete what we have set out to do and to achieve effective work of what is already established and working. I think it is a more helpful approach than smashing the entire system.

But one can hardly overlook the fact that the aggressiveness and determination that marked the start of the reform have faded and have partly become routine, and the effort is already getting bogged down in bickering between departments.

<…>

It should also be recognised that people, ordinary citizens and society as a whole, often have a very low opinion of the work of the courts. Many factors contribute to this. There are long queues in reception areas, poor standard of office work and elementary lack of organisation. That situation cannot be tolerated. We should all foster respect for the courts and their rulings.

<…>

The shortcomings and mistakes of our court system fuel mistrust of the law. Opinion polls have revealed that people increasingly try to avoid complicated court proceedings. They are afraid of being “railroaded into jail”. The most dangerous thing is that they lose respect for the law.

We should improve not only the procedure of selecting candidates for judges, but also the procedure of appointing and dismissing them. A normal system based on competition should select the best candidates.

Clearly, the judiciary branch does not yet have a complete and modern legal basis. Lack of modern procedural legislation is the main problem. Work on procedural legislation has lasted for years and current legislation is hopelessly outdated. Some articles are known to contravene the Constitution. All that undoubtedly complicates your work.

Along with procedural legislation, many other laws are long overdue. For example, the law on insolvency and bankruptcy is sometimes used to bankrupt essentially healthy companies. A lack of proper regulations in these spheres is used by narrow corporate interest groups to pursue their selfish ends. That, it has to be admitted, is a brake on the country’s economic development. And more and more often the forums of various levels and quality, along with economic restructuring problems raise the issues of improving the judiciary, a key element of the country’s economic development.

<…>

Today, we face a much more formidable challenge than a simple reform of the judiciary system. We have to reverse the kind of attitude to the law courts that we have just discussed. We must prove that the court is the place to go to seek justice. People should come to believe the courts as a branch of power, an absolutely just branch of power.

Thank you. ",President,Vladimir Putin,http://en.kremlin.ru/events/president/transcripts/statements/21125,,DEVELOPMENT
USA,26-02-2021 00:00,Joe Biden,Remarks by President Biden at a FEMA COVID-⁠19 Vaccination Facility,"THE PRESIDENT:  You’re all being very polite.  You’ve been with me all day, and it’s dinner time.  (Laughs.) 

Good afternoon — or almost.  Actually, it’s evening.  And I want to thank you, Governor and Mrs. Abbott, for your hospitality and your friendship.  And Representative — Senator Cornyn, I think he had to go back; I think he’s getting on a plane.  He told me last — he came in to see me last event.  And Representatives Sheila Jackson Lee, Al Green, Sylvia Garcia, Lizzie Pannilli [sic] — excuse me, Pannill [Fletcher] — and — what am I doing here?  I’m going to lose track here.  And Mayor Turner, Judge Hidalgo.  Thank you all for welcoming us. 

And Jill and I wanted to visit Texas today for a couple of reasons: First and foremost, to let the people of Texas know our prayers are with you in the aftermath of this winter storm.  And secondly, to let you know what I told Governor Abbott and Mayor Turner and Judge Hidalgo and the congressional delegation: that we will be true partners to help you recover and rebuild from the storms and this pandemic and the economic crisis.  We’re in for the long haul.  (Applause.) 

Earlier today, we received an update on the storm relief efforts from — from Harris County, at the Harris County Emergency Operations Center.  The folks there are doing God’s work, as my mother would say.  It was an important update on how the federal government and the states are working together through the major disaster declaration and the emergency declarations that I made after the storm hit when the governor contacted me. 

The Federal Emergency Management, FEMA, is providing millions of gallons of water and millions of meals, direct assistance, to uninsured homeowners to repair the damage burst pipes caused to millions of homes across this state.  And the public assistance that comes with a disaster declaration ensures that mayors and county officials can find shelter for folks in need and keep them safe and warm.  This in addition to the more than 125,000 blankets FEMA has also made available to storm victims so children and families don’t go to sleep cold. 

FEMA, working with the Defense Logistics Agency and the Army Corps of Engineers from the Defense Department, has made generators and diesel fuel available to hospitals and nursing homes and other critical facilities to keep the lights on and speed power restoration along the way.  Many local military bases are helping efforts to distribute water and food, fuel, and blankets all across this state. 

And I especially want to thank the service members for helping your fellow Americans in time of need.  When we have a problem, we always call on the military — domestic or foreign — no matter what.  You’re the best in the world.  (Applause.) 

And I know millions of Texans have been impacted by the disruption of community water systems as a result of the power outages.  The Environmental Protection Agency has deployed mobile drinking water labs in Houston, San Antonio, and Fort Worth to test water so we can get the — so you can get boil water advisories lifted and get safe drinking water flowing through those faucets again. 

There’s more, but let me say this: We’re not here today as Democrats or Republicans.  We’re here today as Americans.  The American leaders, with responsibility — all of us here in this parking lot — responsibility to all the people we serve.  When a crisis hits our states, like the one that hit Texas, it’s not a Republican or Democrat who’s hurting; it’s our fellow Americans who are hurting.  And it’s our job to help everyone in need.  Look out for one another.  Leave nobody behind. 

That’s what we’ve seen today on our visit.  After our briefing on the storm relief, we stopped by the Houston Food Bank that’s also doing God’s work — incredible operation — just like everyone else here in this — in the vaccination center.  They’ve done thousands of people.  Thousands of people.  It’s making — making a fundamental difference in the safety and security of people.

The more people get vaccinated, the faster we will beat this pandemic.  That’s why one of my first steps and my first goals as President was to announce that I was going to get 100 million COVID vaccine shots administered in my first 100 days.  And because of the people behind me and others, America would be the — is going to be the first in the country — perhaps the first in the world — to get that done.  (Applause.)  

And I’m proud to say we’re halfway there: 50 million shots.  Actually, I — I was telling the congressman earlier, I carry a little card with me.  And it lists, every day, the number of — the actual number of vaccines that have been administered.  As of today, five- — as of last night, 503,587 — every single one matters — in just 37 days.  (Applause.)  Weeks ahead of schedule.  We’re weeks ahead of schedule.  Even with setbacks from the winter storm, we’re moving in the right direction. 

Look, in the last six weeks, we’ve gone from 6 million shots right before we took office, in total, to 12 million shots per week now.  We’ve increased vaccine distribution by 70 percent.  Sixty percent of the people over the age of six- — sixty percent of the people over the age of 75 have received at least one shot.  Close to 50 percent of the people over the age of 65 got at least one shot.  And you say, why am I focused on that?  Well, it’s especially important because people over the age of 65 account for 80 percent of all the COVID deaths.   Eighty percent. 

Roughly 75 percent of the people who live in long-term care facilities now have gotten their first dose, and those cases are at the lowest level since reporting began in May.  We’re making this progress because of all of you.  The federal government and the states are working together along with public and private partners. 

It starts with supply.  We worked with vaccine manufacturers — Pfizer and Moderna — to ensure we have enough supply to supply all adults in America by the end of July.  And we discovered that vaccine manufacturers, though, weren’t getting prioritized when it came to securing supplies they needed to fix their problem of not being able to go more rapidly.  So I used the Defense Production Act to speed up the supply chain for key equipment that’s already helped increase vaccine production. 

Last week, I toured the Pfizer vaccine manufacturing facility in Kalamazoo, Michigan.  It’s incredible — the precision, the safety, the pride, the sense of purpose — everyone involved at that facility. 

And we’ve all seen the news about the Johnson & Johnson vaccine today.  It’s just the third safe, effective vaccine.  And it’s out.  They’ve approved it today.  We’re going to use every conceivable way to expand manufacturing of the vaccine — the third vaccine — to make even more rapid progress at getting shots in people’s arms.

Here’s what else we’re doing: We’re increasing the number of vaccinators.  The people putting the — it’s one thing to have the vaccine; it’s another thing to get it in people’s arms.  We’ve brought back retired doctors and nurses by executive order, allowing that to happen.  We’ve already deployed more than 1,500 professionals — medical professionals — you see during natural disasters from FEMA, our Commissioned Corps from the Department of Health and Human Services, and the Defense Department, including the National Guard.  And we’re lining up thousands more.

We’re also setting up more places to get vaccinated.  And today — as of today, we provided $3.8 billion to states, territories, and tribes — (applause) — to create hundreds of new vaccination centers and ramp up existing ones.  We’re providing personnel and equipment, and we’re covering the costs for states, including the use of their National Guards. 

Here in Texas, it’s meant millions of dollars and hundreds of vaccinators working at community vaccination centers and three mass vaccination centers in Arlington, Dallas, and right here in Houston, on the other side here, that vaccinate thousands of Texans a day.  Tens of thousands overall. 

I want to show the American people the extraordinary effort being made and undertaken in the most difficult operational challenge this nation has ever faced logistically.  It’s remarkable.  About 6,000 doses a day here.

Folks who are eligible can call by phone, sign up online for an appointment, drive in, stay in their cars, and get a shot.  In and out in a very short amount of time.  It requires massive logistical coordination and critical federal support from FEMA and the National Guard to work with cities and states, and the Houston Texans, to stand up this kind of site. 

Vice President Harris and I did a virtual tour of a similar vaccination center in Arizona.  One nurse — one nurse there said — she talked about the shots, talking how many they were getting in people’s arms, and she said she felt like she was administering — and get this — a “dose of hope.”  A dose of hope. 

We’re working with governors across the country to stand up and lend federal support to hundreds of vaccination centers — from stadiums, like here, to community centers, to houses of worship, large parking lots, delivery places.  Doses of hope we can get in people’s arms as quickly as possible. 

I’ve also sent millions of vaccines to thousands of local pharmacies — over 7,000 — to make it easier for folks to get the COVID-19 vaccine shot like they would a flu shot, because people are comfortable going to their local pharmacy.  They go there for their flu shot and everything else.  They trust the pharmacist, and they’re likely to go.

Here in Texas, that includes 500 pharmacies across this state, like Walmart and CVS, including 50 pharmacies here in Houston.  And for the folks who didn’t live near a vaccination center or a pharmacy, we’re deploying mobile clinics to go out to those neighborhoods in rural areas where people are unable to get to the centers.  These are special vehicles with pop-up clinics that meet folks where they live and where they don’t have the transportation to get the shots, which they’ll be launching very soon here in Houston — that mobile — those mobile units — as well as Dallas, Arlington, and across the state. 

We’ve also started to send vaccines directly to community health centers to help the hard-to-reach folks in cities, small towns, and rural communities in black, Latino, and Native American communities that have higher rates of COVID-19 infections and deaths than any other group. 

Here in Texas, we’re already partnering with 12 community health centers in 10 cities, which have combined sites at over 100 locations across the entire state.  We’re going to save people’s lives.

As a result of these round-the-clock efforts, in five weeks, America has administered the most shots of any country in the world.  That’s great progress.  And it’s also true that while COVID-19 vaccinations are up, COVID-19 cases and hospitalizations are down. 

But I need to be honest with you.  I said from the beginning — like Roosevelt who said, I’ll shoot you “straight from the shoulder” — you can handle anything as long as you’re told the truth.  Cases and hospitalizations could go back up with new — as new variants emerge.  And it’s not the time to relax.  We have to keep washing our hands, staying socially distanced.  And for God’s sake, wear your mask.  (Applause.)  Wear your mask.  It’s not a political statement; it’s a patriotic thing to do. 

Some of our progress in this fight is because so many Americans are stepping up and doing these things.  And the worst thing we could do now would be let our guard down. 

And here’s another critical point: We’re going to hit a phase in this effort, maybe late April or early May, when many predict there will be ramped-up vaccine supply and we’ll have administered shots to most of the people who really are eager to get them and those who have been able to get there.  But at the same time, the warning is: There’ll be people who live in hard-to-reach areas who can’t get the shots, and there are folks who are hesitant to take the shots. 

We all know there’s a history in this country of subjugating certain communities to terrible medical and scientific abuse.  But if there’s one message that needs to cut through all of this: The vaccines are safe.  I promise you.  They are safe and effective.  Listen to Dr. Fauci.  Listen to the scientists who developed them through extensive and rigorous review.  I did.  And I took my shot publicly to demonstrate to the American people it’s safe and effective. 

To address this challenge, we’re going to launch a massive campaign to educate people about the vaccines — that they are safe and effective, and that they can go and get those shots and be good. 

I’m going to close with this: This past year has been one of the most painful years in American history.  As I said, we’ve lost over 500,000 lives to the virus.  Five hundred thousand moms and dads, husbands and wives, sons and daughters staring at an empty chair at that dining room table or the kitchen table; friends, neighbors, co-workers, and over the country — all over the country where the loved ones who are gone — they’re gone.  Empty.  Empty feeling in your chest, like you’re being sucked into a black hole in your chest.  But all over the country, where loved ones once sat, there’s an empty chair.

And, folks, look, there’s so much we can do.  As you see the broken hearts in the families that have been left behind, there’s nothing partisan about this virus.  It’s too long we have allowed the virus to divide us. 

I met today with Governor Abbott, Senator Cornyn — conservative Republicans.  I’m a Democratic President.  We disagree on plenty of things, and there’s nothing wrong with that.  But there are plenty of things we can work on together, and one of them is represented right here today: the effort to speed up vaccinations.  We’re not giving shots to Democrats or Republicans.  I say it again: We’re giving shots to Americans. 

All across the country, we’ve got members of the Armed Forces, FEMA, volunteers, retirees, fellow Americans working around the clock to give these shots.  And they’re building on the work of scientists, researchers, doctors, and nurses.  And my team at the White House, which is coordinating all of this, is first rate. 

None of this has a partisan tinge or a partisan element to it.  This can be a great American achievement — being the only country in the world to reach 100 million shots in 100 days.  This could unite us as a country — to vaccinate America, to protect America, to heal America.  And I know we can do this.  Why?  Because I know America can do great things when we do it together. 

I know my family spent a lot of time here in Houston, by the way, at — hey, John Eddie.  How are you, buddy?  I didn’t see you there.  At Houston, at MD Anderson, when our son Beau was being treated for glioblastoma before he passed away. 

Just yesterday, I saw MD Anderson announce its joint — he joined four — they joined four other major cancer hospitals to help break down the silos that make real progress in this effort difficult.  Now they’re sharing data and information.  That wasn’t going on four or five years ago.  We’re going to beat cancer.  I know we will. 

I’ve said it before and I’ll say it again: If there is just one thing — one thing — I could be known for as President, it would be to end — the President who, during his era, ended cancer as we know it.

But then, last week — (applause) — guess what? — we also landed a rover on Mars.  (Applause.)  We — led by a NASA team in Pasadena, California.  A rover carries instruments developed by a team here in Houston that will be used in the mission of our time and our dreams.  Imagine.  We tell — everybody has been so down the last number of years about what America — what can we do?  Who are — we can do anything!  America can do anything.  (Applause.)  And now we see the images that are truly stunning: battling COVID, beating cancer, going to Mars. 

If there’s one thing I know about America, it’s this: Americans never give up.  They never give in.  They never cry uncle.  They just struggle, innovate, and they preserve — and persevere.  (Applause.)  We’re going to get through all of this, I promise you.  And we’re going to do it together.  Together. 

God bless you all.  And may God protect our troops.  You’re the best.  We can do all of this, guys.  I promise you.  We can do this.  Nobody in the world can compete with us when we’re together.  Thank you all so very much.  (Applause.)

Russia,14-11-2002,Vladimir Putin,Opening Remarks at a Meeting with the Leaders of Parties and Deputies in the State Duma,"Good afternoon.

We met with you not long ago in connection with the tragic events in Moscow. Today we are holding a working meeting on which we had agreed previously. It is very important for the country because today we will discuss a conceptual issue connected with state building.

You know that a year and a half ago, in July, I think, I signed a decree and a commission was created to work on delimitation of the powers between the municipalities, regional and federal governments. All these problems had come to a head. And before introducing them at the State Duma, I would like to hear your opinions on these problems and know your vision of the proposals contained in the draft law. It has been discussed by the broad public, in the media and at the State Council. I am aware that hearings on the issue have been held in Parliament. In short, a major national debate on these problems has taken place in the country.

On the basis of such a profound and all-round discussion the commission has prepared corresponding bills. I must say that the commission has done a huge amount of work and analysed more than 250 laws. That work was conducted jointly with the regions, representatives of the regional authorities and municipalities. And anticipating our conversation I would like to dwell on the key provisions of the bills.

The most important thing is that the bills would significantly decentralise power where it is necessary, on the issues which cannot be effectively solved from Moscow or even from the level of regional governments. It is necessary to put in place reliable legal mechanisms that ensure the independence and responsibility of the regional and local authorities.

Independence and responsibility within clearly circumscribed powers. On the one hand, we should draw a line between the obligations of the regions and local government to the citizens and the state. On the other hand, we must ensure a uniform approach to the settlement of relations between the regional and local authorities and between them and the federal government.

I think it is a fundamental and fair requirement that the rules of relations between regional and local governments be based on the same principles as the relations between the federal centre and the regional government.

The core of these bills is to seal the rules and mechanisms that determine the rights, duties and responsibilities of the federal centre, the regional and local governments.

The rules boil down to the following. The so-called autonomous powers of the regional and local authorities will be determined exclusively by the Constitution and the two bills that are before you. These powers must be financed exclusively from regional and local budgets.

In order to fulfil their mandates, the regional and local budgets must envisage corresponding sources of revenue. That would probably require additions to the Tax and Budget codes. I know that the State Duma deputies have their own ideas and fears about this lest these changes in the Tax and Budget codes come too late. And they would like to synchronise work on these documents as regards the delimitation of powers and financial support of the exercise of the rights and performance of obligations.

The second problem is the delegation of responsibilities. Those who have worked in the regions know what it is. I know from my own experience when, during the course of the year while implementing the budget, problems start being palmed off on you from above, and regional governments or local governments are saddled with tasks they had not suspected would fall to them, with nothing being said about how the fulfilment of these tasks will be funded.

The bills that are before you establish that delegated responsibilities must be funded only by targeted subventions from the higher-level budget. If the higher level of government has encumbered the lower level with some problems, it should make sure to finance the solution of these problems.

Now a few words about the development of local government. In spite of the constitutional provisions there are still regions where local government is absent as an institution. In some it proceeds against the law. Some regions have already established genuinely positive models, positive models of local government. Such examples can be cited.

In order not to repeat mistakes we had to take into account both the positive and the negative experiences and minimise the conflicts that flare up all the time and that harm people. The authorities that are closest to the people are local authorities. The municipalities bear the brunt of many difficult social and economic problems.

I believe that the overall principles of territorial organisation of municipal government must be established by the federal law. Determining the boundaries of municipalities, merging or separating concrete municipal entities must be the prerogative of the constituent entities of the Russian Federation and the citizens who live in the cities and communities. Likewise, it is up to regional governments to take into account regional features, historical traditions and cultural features.

These are some of the issues I wanted to touch upon. I am sure that many more issues will be raised during the discussion today.

The question we are to discuss today is extremely important for the nation. It is in fact about the building of the state. You, the people elected directly in the regions often visit your regions and surely know these problems. The solution of these issues ultimately rests with you. And, as in the case of the package of laws on judicial reform, I would like to hear your opinions and take them into account, and if you have any remarks I would like to hear them before the bills are introduced to the State Duma.",President,Vladimir Putin,http://en.kremlin.ru/events/president/transcripts/statements/21779,,OTHERS
USA,23-05-2017 00:00,Donald Trump,Remarks by President Trump at Yad Vashem,"PRESIDENT TRUMP:  Thank you, Prime Minister Netanyahu, Sara Netanyahu, Chairman Avner Shalev, and Rabbi Israel Meir Lau for hosting us for this moving wreath-laying ceremony.

We are here at Yad Vashem to honor the memory of six million Jews murdered in the Holocaust.  Two-thirds of the Jews in Europe were sent to their deaths.  Words can never describe the bottomless depths of that evil, or the scope of the anguish and destruction.

It was history’s darkest hour.  Millions of innocent, wonderful and beautiful lives — men, women and children — were extinguished as part of a systematic attempt to eliminate the Jewish people.  It was the most savage crime against God and his children.  And it is our solemn duty to remember, to mourn, to grieve and to honor every single life that was so cruelly and viciously taken.

As Elie Wiesel said: “For the dead and the living, we must bear witness.”  These words should be carved into the conscience of humanity forever.  Only when we remember the families who were torn apart from everyone they loved, who suffered that terrible darkness and evil, who endured the unbearable horror of the Holocaust — only then can we prevent this agony from ever repeating.

This place, and this entire nation, are a testament to the unbreakable spirit of the Jewish people — and the hope that light can shine the path beyond the darkness.  Through persecution, oppression, death, and destruction, the Jewish people have persevered.  They have thrived.  They’ve become so successful in so many places.  And they have enlightened the world.  The State of Israel is a strong and soaring monument to the solemn pledge we repeat and affirm:  Never again.

From the depths of the suffering, the Jewish people have built a mighty nation — and the Star of David waves proudly above this cherished land.

As long as we refuse to be silent in the face of evil, as long as we refuse to dim the light of truth in the midst of darkness, as long as we refuse to become bystanders to barbarity, then we know that goodness, peace and justice will ultimately prevail.

With sadness for the lives and dreams that were stolen from this Earth, with determination to always keep the memories of the victims alive, and with resolve to confront evil wherever it threatens, we ask God to give us the strength, wisdom and courage to chart the righteous path.
Thank you.  God bless the memory of the perished.  God bless the survivors.  God bless the Jewish people.  And God bless the State of Israel.  Thank you for having me.  Thank you.",President,Donald Trump,https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefings-statements/remarks-president-trump-yad-vashem-2/,,INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS
Russia,12-05-2013 00:00,Vladimir Putin,Russian Popular Front conference,"Good afternoon, dear friends. I am glad to be able to welcome you to the Russian Popular Front conference.

I just heard in detail about how discussions went in different forums, discussions about the economy in general, the social sphere, healthcare and pension reform. I know that these discussions were quite energetic, tough, meaningful, and that a lot of suggestions were made.

I consider it very important that events like today’s and yesterday’s are being held at precisely this time, because as you know we are preparing the Presidential Address to the Federal Assembly. And it is very important to hear what you are devoting attention to, what worries the Russian Popular Front and those who work in these forums, and what suggestions you have.

Actually, a fundamental idea behind the Russian Popular Front was to create the conditions for citizens and various social and professional groups to participate directly in setting a national agenda. The idea was that people should have the opportunity to set the authorities various tasks, and to ensure their implementation.

What did I want to note at the beginning of our conversation? Six months ago, at our founding congress, we created a broad social movement: the Popular Front for Russia. This movement is ready to take responsibility for solving the most difficult problems and, indeed, the discussions I just mentioned bear witness to this. The Front is ready to take responsibility for implementing our general programme using the mechanisms of direct democracy and by ensuring that citizens participate in our country’s life. I am grateful to you, dear friends and colleagues, for taking on this work without hesitation. Certainly, this position generates a positive response from our citizens.

I would also like to thank my authorised representatives, who are present in this room. I know that many of you are involved in developing the Russian Popular Front federal and regional structures, and some simply interact with the movement in different instances.

The main thing is not formalities, but that the Front and authorised representatives continue to act as a team, because naturally we all share the same goal. I should add that initiatives of Russian Popular Front members, their insistence and persistence, have forced all levels of authority to move forward, to get active, and to operate faster and more efficiently. Not simply to pretend, but actually to listen to public opinion. This is an extremely important thing, and I can assure you that it is being felt in the so-called corridors of power.

In this regard it is revelatory that the process of taking administrative and economic decisions has become more open. And the public discussion of many important issues, something initiated and organised by the Russian Popular Front, played an important role in this respect.

I would single out the work of our representatives within the State Duma. Deputies from the Russian Popular Front have already achieved [the adoption of] legislative amendments, amendments that are important for millions of our citizens. And to do this they sometimes had to argue with the authorities – I know this very well – with colleagues not only from opposition parties but also from the majority faction. If you are convinced you are right, you must continue, as happens today, to firmly defend your position.

The assets of the Russian Popular Front include a number of public initiatives with far-reaching effects, including the Internet project, For Fair Procurements. This project did not take a populist turn, but rather became a working mechanism for social oversight of state procurement orders and the fight against corruption.

I know that you plan to establish effective public oversight in a field such as road repairs. This is an extremely important thing! Strictly speaking, the initiators of this movement joined the Russian Popular Front after they had already garnered some practical experience in this area.

What I would like to emphasise? For a broad social movement such as the Front there are no minor problems. Because behind every seemingly private matter, behind each of these issues there is concrete human life, the fate of entire regions, and real situations in particular towns or villages. And of course indifference to this is absolutely unacceptable.

Therefore, the Russian Popular Front must continue to use all possibilities and measures to restore justice if it has been infringed, and to protect people’s interests and rights. You must act as an example of citizens who actively participate in our country’s life, and serve as an example for our entire society.

Dear friends, I am sure that the Russian Popular Front will evolve, and more of our representatives will actively assert themselves not only through public activities, but also within government structures. I would point out that our political system has become more open and competitive, that opportunities for new, bright people to enter politics are expanding, and that demands on candidates themselves to participate in all levels of government are increasing.

The importance of elections in single-member constituencies is rising. Here people can see who votes honestly, who expresses their position openly, and who achieves what they promised during the election campaign. And we must prove that we have the right to represent citizens’ interests by remaining in direct contact with them.

You need to be with people and take on their interests. Of course, it is possible to do this through the instruments of the Russian Popular Front. I am sure that all those who have meaningful ideas, who intend to solve problems in towns, cities, regions, and in the entire country, will be able to adequately express themselves during election campaigns, and become real people’s deputies.

Again I would urge you to communicate as much as possible with citizens, to obtain feedback on how our plans are being implemented, and what is preventing them from being implemented, especially on location.

Precisely here there is a great space for citizens’ initiatives, for their participation in the lives of their cities and towns. And we need to develop and support these initiatives. I am referring to the realisation of social volunteer projects and other forms of civic participation. And of course, we have to involve in our work talented, professionally trained people, activists who have proven their worth at the level of local government.

It is important that Russia’s human capital increases, and for as many as possible bright, energetic people to participate in the development of their regions and the entire country. And, as I already said, to participate in implementing our overall programme, which reflects the interests and aspirations of the majority of our citizens.

Thank you very much for your attention.

We can discuss the topics which prompted our gathering; I know that yesterday you already did so very actively with various levels of authority, and especially with the Government.

Thank you.

<…>

Vladimir Putin: Let’s begin with a very sensitive and important subject – last year’s presidential executive orders and their implementation. The executive orders are not just some papers that were prepared during the election campaign. They concern a number of issues whose resolution has been long overdue. These documents serve as a roadmap and an objective for all executive authorities, both federal and regional.

We know that the tasks set forth in those executive orders are very serious in practically all areas. They are difficult to fulfil even under the best conditions, with booming economy and high economic growth rates.

Unfortunately, today we see that our economy largely reflects what has already been happening for several years in the global economy and, worst of all, in the European economy, since Europe is our main market. More than 50% of our trade turnover is with EU nations.

So the on-going recession, which has already lasted several years and continues, is now affecting us as well. Our growth level is higher than in many EU nations, but it is insufficient, and the rate of growth is not enough to reach all of our objectives.

What does this mean? It does not mean we should use this as an excuse to put aside the 2012 executive orders we are discussing right now and say we cannot implement them. I am sure we can and must do it.

The question is what sources will be used to implement these objectives. In previous years, oil and gas revenues served as the primary source of funding; but today, tomorrow and in the next few years, the source of funding should come from restructuring of our economy, social sphere, and making a qualitative step forward in their improving effectiveness and competitiveness.

Can we do it? Of course, we can. Incidentally, regardless of the oil and gas revenue level, this is still our only future. And the events currently occurring in the global and European economy, the fact that they affect our own economy, should mobilise us. They should not make us complacent; on the contrary, they should serve as a booster for us. But we must all understand that this is not an easy path.

What does it mean when I talk about restructuring the economy and the social sphere? It means that we must eliminate everything that has been functioning ineffectively, which is costly and does not yield the necessary results for our citizens or the nation overall.

But by choosing this path, including with involvement of platforms like this, which are becoming exceedingly important, we must strive for national consensus and an understanding of what is ineffective and what needs to be done in order to increase the competitiveness of individual sectors and the entire economy overall. We must identify action steps to minimise possible social consequences during this restructuring process, to bring them down to zero, identify how to concentrate government resources in order to reach new technological levels in our economy without putting the social sphere on the back burner. This is what we need to think about.

This is what we must consider in advance and work purposefully. That way, we will not only achieve the goals set forth in my 2012 executive orders, but also achieve our main goal: we will make our economy and society more effective, modern, and future-oriented.

And this will allow us to improve our people’s living standards on an entirely new basis, and achieve the goal I spoke about – 25 million jobs, and so on. These are only figures, but they should be followed by real changes.

Finally, do we need to work on the issue of monitoring implementation? Of course we do! And it is imperative for this monitoring to be public. Under no circumstances should we allow the May 2012 executive orders to turn into a series of run-arounds. Before we discontinue any such monitoring, we need to examine it on a broad public platform such as the Russian Popular Front.

But I don’t want to make any enemies. The work I have spoken about is very difficult. And it often elicits a certain kind of reaction if we do not explain what is and will be done in a clear, timely manner. This is difficult work. But colleagues from executive authorities must understand that they will be carrying out this workunder public supervision. There is no top secret involved that needs to be hidden from our people.

I fully share your position and will give direct instructions to the Control Directorate to continue supervisionuntil this work is completed.

<…>

As far as ‘Open Government’ is concerned, it would seem that our colleagues have not got used yet to working so openly. Let’s see it as growing pains. Of course they are going to have to get used to it and keep going. It’s absolutely not enough to just discuss a few international issues through the Open Government system, discuss matters, join or not join this or that international legal agreement. We need far more than this. 

If what we want is for our executive government bodies to be open, then they have to be open in practice, in real life. I can therefore assure you that we will continue with this work, step by step, but in rapid time, and we will definitely achieve our objective, especially if we carry out your proposal on monitoring implementation of executive orders.

<…>

Let’s hold a separate meeting on education. I’m not opposed to the idea, on the contrary, I’m all for it. This is an important area, probably one of the most important spheres of our life. If there really are things that are not very clear and require further clarification or perhaps some adjustment, this is normal enough. We just need to discuss it and take the necessary measures in good time. Let’s plan a meeting and examine the issues through this platform.

On the subject of using museums, in the past they were certainly widely used in the education process. I know this very well because I lived in Leningrad – St Petersburg – and we went often to the Hermitage, the Russian Museum, and the Ethnographic Museum. I remember it well. I can say from my own experience that it really was very useful. It was a part of my general education, just as for the other kids who studied with me in school and then at university. It was very important for us.

<…>

I agree completely with you on the subject of developing domestic tourism. This is extremely important, especially for the more remote parts of our country. In Kaliningrad say, there is a whole generation now, many teenagers and young people, who have been numerous times to Poland or Germany, but have never visited anywhere in Russia outside Kaliningrad Region. This is obviously something we need to think about. We need to take action, work in interactive format, and this means using our federal programme for developing local and domestic tourism.

<…>

On the subject of agriculture, we allocated somewhere around 200 billion rubles for supporting the agriculture sector this year, I think. That is a lot of money. Perhaps even this is not enough, but you know that we also made decisions on extending earlier loans and lowering interest rates and loan payments under agro-leasing schemes. You also know about the decision to subsidise each hectare of cultivated land. All of this amounts to quite substantial and large-scale support.

Of course we will not abandon the agricultural producers, who have ended up in difficulties due to droughts and to the floods in the Far East, and also – let’s be frank – due to Russia’s entry into the World Trade Organisation, which has put some agriculture sectors in a difficult position and increased competition on our domestic market. Import volumes have gone up.

We have done a lot in poultry farming say, but I know that there are still problems in that sector too. Seven years ago, we were importing 1.4 million tons of poultry. From there, the figure has dropped to almost nothing. It went down to 600,000 tons, then to 200,000 tons, then to 150,000 tons. But the poultry sector still has problems. True, through the WTO we now have protective measures.

I already spoke about this, but for those who do not remember all the details, let me remind you: we have the right to give $9 billion in subsidies to our economy through to 2013 inclusive. Then it must come down to 4 or 5 billion and we will have to gradually lower it. But this is a good and solid safety cushion. Problems still remain even so, including with agricultural engineering. This is something we need to examine of course. The Government and the Agriculture Ministry will have to calculate how much extra funding is needed. I promise that I will send this signal to the Government.

<…>

Regarding healthcare modernisation and the modernisation programme, yes, funding for that programme ended this year. How much did we have, 460 billion over two years?

Reply: Yes.

Vladimir Putin: Funding for this programme has ended, but this absolutely does not mean that the whole modernisation programme has ended. Of course this is not the case. This particular programme was only a part of the overall modernisation plan, which is to ensure that we at the federal level do what is impossible or difficult to do at the regional or even more so at the local level. The aim is to build up the technical base in the healthcare sector in the regions so that they will then be able to work on the areas that come under their direct responsibility.

Whether at the federal or the regional level, the healthcare modernisation programme is planned to be carried out over a period of decades, and it does not end when funding of 460 billion ends for a particular part of the overall programme. Of course this is not so. Additional funds will be allocated at regional and at federal level. We need to monitor this very closely.

<…>

On the subject of pensions, this is an extremely important issue in both social and economic terms. From the economic point of view, this is one of the biggest fundamental development issues that we face. We have 34 million pensioners and a third or more of them will take early retirement. This creates a burden for the budget and the Pension Fund.

The Pension Fund is currently running a deficit. We are covering the deficit with money from the budget or from the National Welfare Fund, which is formed by oil and gas revenues. I want this to be clear. I have already spoken about this many times. We often hear: “Oil and gas are expensive here. How is that affecting our people?” It is precisely this oil and gas revenue, which we put into the Reserve Fund, that we are using to cover the pension system’s deficit. 

But ultimately, there should be no deficit in the pension system at all. We have already discussed many times the idea of raising the retirement age, as many European countries and our neighbours too have already done. Incidentally, Ukraine raised its retirement age too. We are not taking this step.

But we do need to ensure our pension system’s sustainability and make it an effective part of the Russian economy as a whole. It must ensure social justice and guarantee that pensions will be comparable to the average incomes we have had over recent years. In other words, we need to guarantee the replacement coefficient – how pensions compare to wages. What’s more, we need to strive for the same kind of level that the developed world economies are able to provide. Is this possible? Yes!

<…>

Interethnic relations are an extremely sensitive, crucial area of our lives. Over 80% of our population consists of ethnic Russians, and they are certainly the group that drives our nation’s development, both culturally and demographically.

But Russia’s strength lies in the fact that it is a multi-ethnic and multi-faith nation. If we want to preserve this, we must give this matter our utmost attention. And there is just one correctapproach: all citizens of the Russian Federation are equal regardless of their faith or ethnicity. This means everyone must respect our laws equally, and everyone must be held equally responsible if they violate those laws, also regardless of national, ethnic or religious affiliation. And nobody should hide behind their exceptionalityand demand any sort of special rights for themselves. That is what’s most important.

The fight against corruption, particularly in law enforcement, and the fight against ethnic crime are exceedingly important issues, and it is vital to react to such crimes swiftly. So I am once again appealing to all participants and members of the Russian Popular Front. Sometimes, it is hard to counter them at a local level; that means we should take these matters to a higher level of the Popular Front, so that they reach the executive authorities more quickly and help us all react promptly and firmly to these problems. We will not let this issue fall by the wayside.

<…>

I would like to point out that we now have the best birth rates in over 20 years, and this is not only due to maternity capital, although that is part of it. It has to do with the entire system of measures the government has been taking over the last seven to eight years. And what’s most important is that people are planning further into the futureand there is an increased sense of stability. That, I think, is the most important factor, when you can plan a family and are not afraid to have children, as well as maternity capital and other forms of support.

It is true that we had a sharp drop in birth rates in the 1990s – probably the greatest drop since World War II. I think it may even have been worse than during the war. You see, the 1990s were a catastrophic period for our nation. What does this mean? It means that the generation born at the start of the 1990s will now be joining the workforce and starting families. It is a small group, relatively speaking, and we will once again experience a decline.

Therefore, we must bear this in mind when we make plans to build social institutions. And what should we do in the regions? We must combine the construction of preschools and schools. Why? Because when there are enough preschools, we will be able to use those buildings as schools as well. My colleagues in the regions and I have been discussing this, so they know about it.

<…>

As for developing transport infrastructure and rail operations, it’s true that this sector has certain problems, and they are also related to budgetary financing, including support for Russian Railways. The situation is really very difficult, but it is extremely important and necessary to maintain support for Russian Railways, especially as far as passenger trains are concerned. First and foremost, I am talking about commuter trains; therefore, it is essential to provide financial support to the regions where this kind of commuter transport is particularly important.

The Government is working on this, and in spite of all the budgetary limitations, a decision has been made to provide this support. I do not think our attention to this matter will lag, although we certainly have problems, and they need to be resolved.

I won’t go into details now; this is a vitally important and very difficult area. The fact that you have once again pointed it out is very good, so thank you very much.

You said that Russia is located between the East and the West. In fact, it is the East and West that are located to the left and right of Russia. Nevertheless, the transit potential should certainly be used much more effectively than we have been doing up until now.

Incidentally, we have a great deal of competition at the international level. There are various attempts to organise projects bypassing our territory. But I can tell you that Russian Railways is working very actively in this area. I am sure you have heard about the project to connect the Trans-Korean Mainline and Trans-Siberian Railway.

In spite of all the political complications and risks, Russian Railways has renovated 54 kilometres of railways in North Korea in fairly challenging conditions, and this was not a cheap project. I recently visited South Korea, where I was told that if we connect the two railways, the flow of freight from the industrially developed regions of South Korea through our territory will increase significantly.

There are many other domestic projects aimed at the development of Siberia and the Urals, particularly focused on facilities pertaining to the prospective extraction of mineral resources: the Polar Urals project – I’m sure you’ve heard of it.

Some of these projects have to do with reaching the Arctic seas and building new ports in the south of the country – I am referring to the cluster of ports in the Black Sea Basin, the Sea of Azov and the Caucasus, as well as other ports in the north, such as the Sabetta Port and the development of the Murmansk transport hub. We have enormous projects in this sector, and they will certainly be implemented.

<…>

What I am especially glad to see is that our discussion has been very lively and substantive. I know that the same kind of direct communication took place at round tables yesterday with members of the Russian Federation’s Cabinet and regional authorities. I must tell you: this fills me with certainty that the Russian Popular Front will become an instrument that will truly connect society with the government and help make our entire government apparatus more effective and consistent in its efforts. As a result, our joint work will be truly useful to the citizens of the Russian Federation.

Thank you very much. Please do not be offended that I must end this meeting. There are many questions. I would like to thank you and wish all of us success.

Remarks by the President to First Responders and Volunteers in Boston, MA","Thank you.  Thank you, everybody.  Well, listen, we just had a wonderful interfaith service, and I want to thank Governor Patrick for helping to organize that.  I want to thank both the Governor and your extraordinary Mayor, Tom Menino -- (applause) -- for the incredible leadership and cool under pressure, the organization, the mobilization and the courage that they have shown reflective of this great city and reflective of this great Commonwealth of Massachusetts.

Now, I’m not going to speak long.  I’m just -- he started calling me Reverend Obama, so I know -- (laughter) -- I know I was -- I don't want to go on any longer than I need to.  The main message, in addition to just giving -- having a chance to shake some hands and give some hugs, is just to say how proud the whole country is of you -- (applause) -- how grateful we are -- how grateful we are that in the face of chaos and tragedy, all of you displayed the very best of the American spirit. 

You displayed grit.  You displayed compassion.  You displayed civic duty.  You displayed courage.  And when we see that kind of spirit, there’s something about that that's infectious.  It makes us all want to be better people.  You’ve inspired the entire country.  You’ve inspired the world.  And for that, you should be profoundly proud.

But as Deval and I were talking as we were driving in from the airport, the key is that we hang on to a little bit of that, because it’s right there under the surface every day.  And it expresses itself, obviously, in the Marathon.  It expresses itself in Patriot’s Day.  It expresses itself in all the small interactions, the gestures of kindness and generosity and tolerance and compassion that make up the fabric of our lives.  And we don't always pay attention to it, and we don't always celebrate, and it’s certainly not usually on a television screen, it’s not always reported on.  But that's who we are.

And if there’s anything that was a theme in that interfaith service it’s that out of these ashes, out of the blood that's spilled and the injuries borne, out of that, we get a chance to see and highlight and appreciate that spirit.  And we’ve got to sustain it, because in all of our lives at some point there are going to be some troubles, and there’s evil in the world, and there’s hardship.  But if that spirit is evident and manifest, and that's what we’re teaching our kids and that's what we’re embodying in our own lives, then who can stop us?  Who can touch us?  (Applause.)

So thank you, everybody.  I’m proud of you.  I’m proud of Boston.  And as I just said, I’m looking forward to the 118th Boston Marathon.  God bless you.

Russia,10-10-2007 00:00,Vladimir Putin,Opening Remarks at Meeting with Members of the Executive Committee of the European Jewish Congress,"Good morning, ladies and gentlemen!

I am very happy to welcome to Moscow representatives of one of Europe’s most prominent and influential international organizations, the European Jewish Congress.

In Russia we are well aware of the great contribution that your Congress has made to the development of inter-faith dialogue. You do a lot to preserve the memory of the victims of Nazism by making popular educational programmes.

Your organization has participant status in the Council of Europe and is part of the Conference of International NGOs sponsored by the Council. This also provides additional opportunities for our interaction.

At the meeting of the Executive Committee of the European Jewish Congress that just concluded in Moscow, preparations for a pan-European programme of action against extremism, xenophobia and anti-Semitism was discussed.

We support the initiatives of the European Jewish Congress in this area, and believe that your work is an important complement to all the efforts of international organisations and institutions, aimed at enhancing mutual understanding and tolerance.

We are ready to study the results and put them into practice in the future. I note as well that issues of inter-cultural and inter-faith dialogue and the protection of the rights of national minorities were among the priorities of Russia's presidency of the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe, when we served in that capacity in 2006.

I particularly want to emphasise that Russia’s principal denominations have been proactive in the development of inter-faith dialogue, an important instrument in the modern world. And I want to draw to your attention the fact that, according to Russian law, Judaism is one of Russia’s traditional denominations.

Displays of chauvinism, xenophobia and aggressive nationalism now confront virtually all countries, including states with deep historical democratic traditions. Unfortunately there have been isolated incidents of anti-Semitism and extremist groups in Russia. Some marginal political forces are trying to exploit nationalist slogans. We understand perfectly the threat that the propaganda of nationalism and chauvinism represents for our multi-ethnic and multi-confessional society. And therefore the fight against any manifestations of xenophobia and the prevention of conflicts based on ethnicity are particularly important to us. Russian law enforcement agencies conduct a thorough investigation of all incidents caused by nationalism and racism.

We are paying very close attention to the creation of favourable conditions for the free development of all nations and ethnic groups, national cultures and languages. In 2006, Russia established an Advisory Council in support of regions with cultural and ethnic autonomy. It includes many of the leaders of our country’s ethnic communities, including those representing Jewish Cultural autonomy region. In addition, there is an interdepartmental commission for cooperation among ethnic minorities public associations. Within these structures a dialogue with minorities groups and the expatriate communities is taking place on the major aspects of national policy. I want to emphasize that funding for public policy relating to minorities groups occupies a separate category in the federal budget, which is quite unique for our budgetary process.

I would like to turn to another important topic. Russia has the greatest respect for the work of the Jewish communities to preserve the historical truth of the Holocaust and other Nazi crimes, and of course for the glorious deeds of the soldiers who died freeing Europe from the “brown plague”.

History has shown many times that when nationalism and anti-semitism run rampant, it is the result of neglecting the lessons of the past, of the attempts to rewrite history and to sow the seeds of revanchism. And consequently one cannot but be alarmed by appearances in Europe (including in the EU countries) of a tendency to rewrite history in this area, attempts to cast doubts on the liberating role of the anti-Hitler coalition armies, including the Soviet army during the Second World War, and attempts to whitewash the crimes of Nazism.

For example, some of the facts with which we have been confronted in some countries of Eastern Europe have frankly provoked astonishment and incomprehension. We know that Holocaust denial is a crime in a number of European countries. At the same time, the Latvian and Estonian authorities have openly condoned the glorification of Nazis and their accomplices. And these facts have gone unnoticed by the European Union countries. In Estonia, after the declaration of independence there, not a single Nazi offender was punished. In Latvia, every year on March 16, with the permission of the authorities, neo-Nazis meet on the anniversary of the creation of the Latvian Legion Waffen SS.

We also see the strange position, bordering on hypocrisy, of some European institutions concerning the transfer of the Soldier Liberator monument in Tallinn. I want to note with gratitude the position of Jewish organisations in the Baltic States, which directly, openly and honestly stated their position on this issue. I would like to express our appreciation and gratitude for this.

Here is another example. Certain political forces in Ukraine are trying to whitewash the members of the Organisation of Ukrainian Nationalists and the Ukrainian Rebel Army responsible for the mass extermination of Jews in Ukraine. I think this is totally unacceptable.

Again, such moves are fraught with great danger, the growth of mistrust and intolerance on our continent. Therefore, we expect that states and public organizations, including the European Jewish Congress, will not ignore them or neglect to respond they way they should.

I am glad that you were able to meet in Russia, in Moscow. And please accept once again my most heartfelt welcome.",President,Vladimir Putin,http://en.kremlin.ru/events/president/transcripts/statements/24586,,OTHERS
Russia,29-07-2002,Vladimir Putin,Excepts from a Speech to Senior Officers on the Occasion of Their Promotion to Higher Positions and Higher (Special) Ranks,"Good afternoon,

I congratulate you on your promotions to high military positions and to higher ranks.

Strengthening the country’s officer corps is a key national task. The level of your skills, and your personal responsibility for your job go a long way to determining the overall success of military reform and the effective work of the military and security agencies. I therefore urge you to see your new appointments both as recognition of your professionalism and as being entrusted with tackling the most complicated and ambitious tasks the country faces at the present time.

Among the priorities of military development, I would like to single out the enhancement of the structure of the Armed Forces and the strengthening of their combat readiness. We are shortly to tackle a key practical task: the creation of permanent combat-ready units in all the armed services.

They must be well-equipped, well-trained and effectively controlled. Only then will the accumulated experience be relevant to the modernisation of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation as a whole.

Particular attention must be paid to the training and education of junior officers. The necessary conditions must be created for their professional development and growth.

They are the future of our army.

The security of the state begins with the inviolability of its borders. While we promote cooperation and border contacts with our partners, we must also remember something else. The Russian border must become an insuperable barrier to trans-national crime, smugglers, and drug traffickers. The protection of Russia’s economic interests and our bio-resources demands serious attention.

The fight against international terror remains a key area of the work of all the military and security agencies. The Federal Security Service (FSB) has a very special role to play here. I would like to recognise the growing effectiveness of the FSB units in the North Caucasus. The liquidation of insurgent groups and their leaders, and successful operational support of the anti-terrorist operation is only the visible part of the immense work currently conducted by the Federal Security Service.

Protection of property rights merits special attention. It is important to protect businessmen against pressure from the criminal world. That is a necessary pre-condition for creating a civilised business environment, attracting investment and ensuring sustained economic development. Much will depend on the professionalism and integrity of the tax police.

Once again I congratulate you on your promotions.

USA,31-05-2021 00:00,Joe Biden,Remarks by President Biden at the 153rd National Memorial Day Observance,"THE PRESIDENT:  Madam Vice President, Secretary Austin, Secretary McDonough, General Milley, Gold Star families, my fellow Americans — we’re gathered at this sacred place in this solemn hour to engage in the most fundamental of undertakings: the rite of remembrance.
 
We remember those who gave their all in the service of America, in the service of freedom, in the service of justice.  We remember their sacrifice, their valor, and their grace.  We remember their smiles; their loves; their laughter; their essential, vibrant, and transcendent humanity.
 
For while we stand amid monuments of stone, we must never forget that each of these markers, for those known and unknown, here at Arlington and far beyond represent a precious life: a son, a daughter, a mother, a spouse, a brother, a sister, a friend, a neighbor.
 
To those who mourn a loved one today: Jill and I have some idea how you’re feeling.  Our losses are not the same, but that black hole you feel in your chest — as if it’s going to suck you into it — we get.
 
I know the incredible pride you felt seeing your loved one wear the uniform of our country, and the pride they felt wearing it.
 
Our son Beau’s service in the Delaware Army National Guard unit, the year he spent deployed in Iraq, was one of the things that he was most proud of in life. 
 
Yesterday marked the anniversary of his death.  And it’s a hard time — a hard time of year for me and our family, just like it is for so many of you.  It can hurt to remember, but the hurt is how we feel and how we heal. 
 
I always feel Beau close to me on Memorial Day.  I know exactly where I need to be: right here, honoring our fallen heroes.  Because through pain and anguish of his loss, I remember the pride on his face the day I pinned those bars on his shoulders. 
 
To all of you who are fighting with the fresh pain of loss, as hard as it is to believe, I promise you this: The day will come when the image of your loved one will bring a smile to your lips before it brings a tear to your eyes. 
 
The Bible teaches, “Blessed are they that mourn, for they shall be comforted.”  That comfort, that reassurance can be a long time in coming, but it will come — I promise you.  And my prayer for all of you is that that day will come sooner rather than later. 
 
We all know Memorial Day origins lie in the wake of the Civil War — a war for the freedom of all.  A war for union.  A war for liberty and for the preservation of the Constitution. 
 
In calling for such today, General John Logan, commander of the Grand Army of the Republic, issued General Order Number 11.  He directed the nation set aside a day to honor, and I quote, “those who died in defense of their country during the late rebellion and whose bodies now lie in almost every city, village, and hamlet churchyard throughout the land.” 
 
And so we have and so we do again today, in our time, where the children of sacrifice made by a long line of American servicemembers, each a link in that chain of honor.  We live by the light of the flame of liberty they kept burning.  We’re free because they were brave. 
 
Here on these gentle, rolling green hills and across America and around the globe lie buried the heroes of the greatest experiment the world has ever known, ever seen.  The experiment bears the noble name: The United States of America.
 
Women and men, all those we honor today, gave their lives for their country, but they live forever in our hearts — forever proud, forever honorable, forever American. 
 
They are — they are the sentinels of liberty, defenders of the downtrodden, liberators of nations.  And still today, Americans stand watch around the world, often at their great personal peril.
 
War and conflict, death and loss are not relics of our American history; they’re a part of Americans’ story.  Here in Arlington lie heroes who gave what President Lincoln called “the last full measure of devotion.”
 
They did not only die at Gettysburg or in Flanders Field or on the beaches of Normandy, but in the mountains of Afghanistan, the deserts of Iraq in the last 20 years. 
 
Section 60 — when I walk through it, it reminds me of the cost of war.  Hundreds of graves — hundreds of graves are here from recent conflicts.  Hundreds of patriots gave their all, each — each of them of the leaving behind a family who live with their pain and their absence every single day. 
 
I want to assure each of those families: We will never forget what you gave to our country.  We will never fail to honor your sacrifice. 
 
Each day — starting when I was Vice President of the United States — I carry in my pocket a number of troops killed during the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq.  Not an approximation, not rounded-off numbers — they each leave behind an entire community and family.   And today, that number is 7,036 — 7,036 fallen angels who have lost their lives in these conflicts.
 
And on this Memorial Day, we honor their legacy and their sacrifice.  Duty, honor, country — they lived for it, they died for it.  And we, as a nation, are eternally grateful. 
 
You know, America has been forged in the battle and the fires of war.  Our freedom and the freedom of innumerable others has been secured by young men and women who answered the call of history and gave everything in the service of an idea: the idea of America.
 
It’s the greatest idea in the long history of humankind.  An idea that we’re all created equal in the image of Almighty God.  That we’re all entitled to dignity, as my father would say, and respect, decency, and honor.  Love of neighbor.  They’re not empty words, but the vital, beating heart of our nation. 
 
And that democracy must be defended at all costs, for democracy makes all this possible.  Democracy — that’s the soul of America, and I believe it’s a soul worth fighting for, and so do you; a soul worth dying for.  Heroes who lie in eternal peace in this beautiful place, this sacred place, they believed that too. 
 
The soul of America is animated by the perennial battle between our worst instincts — which we’ve seen of late — and our better angels.  Between “Me first” and “We the People.”  Between greed and generosity, cruelty and kindness, captivity and freedom. 
 
The Americans of Lexington and Concord, of New Orleans, Gettysburg, the Argonne, Iwo Jima and Normandy, Korea and Vietnam, Afghanistan and Iraq, and thousands of places in between — these Americans weren’t fighting for dictators; they were fighting for democracy. 
 
They weren’t fighting to exclude or to enslave; they were fighting to build and broaden and liberate.  They weren’t fighting for self; they were fighting for the soul of the nation, for liberty and simple fair play — simple fair play and decency. 
 
Today, as we remember their sacrifice, we remind ourselves of our duty to their memory, to the future they fought for.  We owe the honored dead a debt we can never fully repay.  We owe them our whole souls.  We owe them our full best efforts to perfect the Union for which they died. 
 
We owe them the work of our hands and our hearts, to make real the promise of a nation founded on the proposition that all of us — all of us — all of us are created equal and deserve to be treated that way throughout our lives. 
 
Democracy is more than a form of government.  It’s a way of being; it’s a way of seeing the world.  Democracy means the rule of the people — the rule of the people.  Not the rule of monarchs, not the rule of the moneyed, not the rule of the mighty — literally, the rule of the people. 
 
The lives of billions, from antiquity to our own hour, have been shaped by the battle between aspirations of the many and the greed of the few.  Between people’s right to self-determination and the self-seeking of the dictator.  Between dreams of democracy and appetites for autocracy, which we’re seeing around the world. 
 
Our troops have fought this battle on fields around the world, but also the battle of our time.  And the mission falls to each of us, each and every day.  Democracy itself is in peril, here at home and around the world. 
 
What we do now — what we do now, how we honor the memory of the fallen, will determine whether or not democracy will long endure.  We all take it for granted.  We think we learned in school.  You have to — every generation has to fight for it. 
 
But, look, it’s the biggest question: Whether a system that prizes the individual, that bends towards liberty, that gives everybody a chance at prosperity — whether that system can and will prevail against powerful forces that wish it harm. 
 
All that we do in our common life as a nation is part of that struggle.  The struggle for democracy is taking place around the world — democracy and autocracy.  The struggle for decency and dignity — just simple decency.  The struggle for posterity — prosperity and progress.  And, yes, the struggle for the soul of America itself. 
 
Folks, you all know it: Democracy thrives when the infrastructure of democracy is strong; when people have the right to vote freely and fairly and conveniently; when a free and independent press pursues the truth, founded on facts, not propaganda; when the rule of law applies equally and fairly to every citizen, regardless of where they come from or what they look like. 
 
(Coughs.)  Excuse me.
 
Wherever Americans are, there — there is democracy: churches and synagogues and mosques, neighborhoods and coffee shops and diners, bleachers at kids’ baseball or soccer games, libraries and parks.  Democracy begins and grows in the open heart and the impetus to come together for a common cause. 
 
And I might note, parenthetically: Thank you, TAPS.  That’s what you do.
 
And that’s where it will be preserved.  For empathy is the fuel of democracy.  Let me say that again: Empathy — empathy is the fuel of democracy, a willingness to see each other — not as enemies, neighbors.  Even when we disagree, to understand what the other is going through. 
 
To state the obvious: Our democracy is imperfect.  It always has been.  But Americans of all backgrounds, races, creeds, gender identities, sexual orientations, have long spilled their blood to defend our democracy.  The diversity of our country and our arm- — and of our armed services is and always has been an incredible strength. 
 
And generation after generation of American heroes have signed up to be part of the fight because they understand the truth that lives in every American heart: that liberation, opportunity, justice are far more likely to come to pass in a democracy than an autocracy. 
 
If every person is sacred, then every person’s rights are sacred.  Individual dignity; individual worth; individual sanctity; the right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.  We say those words so often, but think of it: the right to vote, the right to rise in a world as far as your talent can take you, unlimited by unfair barriers of privilege and power — such are the principles of democracy. 
 
So how would you put these noble principles into practice?  How do we do that?  How do we make the idea real, or as close to real as we can make it? 
 
This nation was built on an idea — the only nation in the world built on an idea.  Every other nation was built on ethnicity, geography, religion, et cetera. 
 
We were built on an idea: the idea of liberty and opportunity for all.  We have never fully realized that aspiration of our founding, but every generation has opened the door a little wider, and every generation has opened it wider and wider to be more inclusive, to include those who have been excluded before.  It’s a mission handed down generation to generation: the work of perfecting our union. 
 
In 1830, when we were a young nation, dis-unionists put their sectional interests ahead of the common good.  A great senator, Daniel Webster, rose in the Capitol to defend the Union.  To him, we were not just a collection of competing forces, but a coherent whole. 
 
His cry, first uttered just across the Potomac in the Capitol, resonates even now.  He stood on the floor and he said, “Liberty and Union, now on forever, one and inseparable.”  Liberty and Union. 
 
More than 142 years later, when I first came to the United States Senate — at a time when our country was so deeply divided over Vietnam, the struggle of civil rights, the fight over women’s rights — I had the notion that my first task, as I stood to make my first speech on the floor of the Senate — it all of a sudden hit me: I’m standing where Daniel Webster had stood; his desk was next to mine. 
 
And I was struck by the weight of history, as corny as it sounds, by the legacy of the work we’re charged to carry forward: liberty and union, now and forever. 
 
Now as then, unity is essential to life; liberty and the pursuit of happiness.  And so we remember those who gave their all in the cause of unity, in the cause of a nation that endures because of them. 
 
We must honor their sacrifice by sustaining the best of America, while honestly confronting all that we must do to make our nation fuller, freer, and more just.  We must remember that we may find the light and the wisdom and, yes, the courage to move forward — in the words of that great hymn, fight as they “nobly fought of old.”
 
For in remembrance lies not just our history, but our hope.  Not just our solemn remembrance, but our renewed purpose.  Not just our solace, but our strength. 
 
This Memorial Day, remember that not all of us are called to make the ultimate sacrifice.  We all are called, by God and by history and by conscience, to make our nation free and fair, just and strong, noble and whole.
 
To this battle, may we now dedicate our souls, that our work may prove worthy of the blood of our fallen.  For this work — the work of democracy — is the work of our time, and for all time.  And if we do our duty, then ages still to come will look back on us and say that we too kept the faith.  And there’s nothing more important, nothing more sacred, nothing more American than keeping the faith. 
 
May God bless the United States of America.  And may the light perpetually shine upon the fallen.  May God bring comfort to their families.  And may God protect our troops, today and always.  God bless you all.",President,Joe Biden,https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/speeches-remarks/2021/05/31/remarks-by-president-biden-at-the-153rd-national-memorial-day-observance/,,NATIONALISM
Russia,30-11-2007,Vladimir Putin,"Opening Address at the Session of the Council for Science, Technology and Education","Good afternoon, dear Council members!

Today's agenda contains one very important issue. I am referring to the 2008–2012 programme for fundamental scientific research. This is the first time that we are adopting a separate programme for this issue and, in large part, this is thanks to the initiative of the Academy of Sciences. And for the first time in many years a significant amount of funding will be allocated to fundamental science. We will guarantee its regular and stable financing throughout the next five years.

I would also to point out that total budgetary spending on science in 2007 amounted to over 200 billion rubles. This is nearly five times more than what we spent in 2000. Five times more! And the total expenditures on science will double again by 2010. If we take into account what Russian business plans to spend in this sector – about 600 billion rubles – then the amount will double again in the next two years. Along with this, I would, nevertheless, like to draw your attention to certain disturbing trends.

The cabinet members and I discussed certain provisions concerning today's meeting and they noticed the following: the more budgetary resources come into the system, the less business invests in this sector. In fact, business gets squeezed out. They are not needed. And why is that? Because everything is stable and secure. And this is wrong: we need to create incentives to attract money from businesses.

As you can imagine, all of this — all of the issues associated with the increase in funding –are important resources that should help encourage the development of science in Russia. There are not only representatives from the Russian Academy of Sciences here, there are also leaders from all public academies. And we are, of course, perfectly aware that fundamental research is a crucial part of science. We believe that this is the basis of its development and, last but not least, the starting point of the entire cycle of innovation.

In connection with this the rapid development of fundamental science will become a necessary condition for the modernization of the entire Russian economy, and for assuming a leading position in the global division of labour. For that reason the programme's priorities, as well as the tools for its implementation, should be directed towards ensuring that academic scientific research has a tangible result for state and society.

You know that in recent years we were able to do more than simply retain science's intellectual base; we were also able to provide significant support to a number of new and promising fields, including nanotechnology, nuclear energy, optoelectronics, bioinformatics, bioengineering and other directions.

We have significantly strengthened science's legal base, we have adopted an up-to-date law on science, and science and technology policy that contains the elements of the programme we are discussing today.

As you are well aware, just a few years ago the Russian cabinet approved a new charter for the Russian Academy of Sciences that consolidates the legal status of the main Academy as well as expands its possibilities, autonomy and spheres of responsibility.

Along with this I would like to draw your attention to the fact that increased autonomy goes together with increased responsibility. We need to think about optimizing the network: there are 600 enterprises of which only 400 are involved directly in scientific research. The remaining 200 are not.

I would like to draw your attention to the fact that the Academy of Sciences is not a commercial organisation. Its main purpose is research, not commercial activities for profit. This also applies to the 200 institutions that are not engaged in scientific research activities. I would like to draw your attention to this.

We already have the results of a pilot project to improve the wages paid within the Russian Academy of Sciences. Just recently it was hard to believe that we would be able to achieve quick and passable results in this sector. And, in general, the Academy of Sciences and its leadership was able to achieve them. Researchers' average salaries have more than doubled and, of course, they will continue to increase.

I regret to have to point out that the cabinet is not fully aware of what is happening in this sphere. In general, we have an agreement with the Academy of Sciences, but what is actually happening is another matter. And the cabinet certainly should pay special attention to this in the near future. We finally need to determine whether additional payments for the degrees and academic stipends are the same thing or not. All members of the Academy of Sciences receive degree payments. And another academic stipend on top of that? Or could the academic stipend simply absorb this additional degree payments? This is not not the most important thing for researchers to work on, but the state and the cabinet – and of course together with the Academy's leadership – must be aware of precisely what is going on in this sphere.

We have to instill order here, and this is quite obvious.

Today academic science's main task is to take advantage of new opportunities. I repeat that these opportunities will increase, and there is no doubt about that. The cabinet will pay all necessary attention to this and the possibilities, including financial ones, will increase. You need to take advantage of these new opportunities and invest in the relevant, promoting competitive advantage knowledge, technology and finished products.

I shall note that adopting such a programme requires further substantial changes in the way that research projects are organised, especially the way they are planned and the priorities they set. The basic capacities of our fundamental science programmes in the coming years depends not only on the success of strategic and and defense industries, but also on developing various social processes in the Russian Federation.

For example, in the humanities creating an up-to-date research methodology remains a priority. This is particularly required in disciplines such as the social sciences, history, sociology and philosophy. And, of course, we need to engage in more profound analyses of the development of contemporary Russian society, and take into account how new global trends influence our country.

With regards to the economic sphere we clearly need strategic scenarios and projections for the social and economic development of both the domestic economy as a whole, and that of separate territories and individual sectors. I repeat that the very future of fundamental sciences depends directly on its ability to ensure that innovative growth takes place in Russia. In turn, this refers to the effectiveness with which they can integrate academic science with the production and professional education. And in this respect I would agree with the recent conclusion made by the Public Chamber. Namely that, unfortunately, these three aspects are proceeding in separate ways and developing in isolation.

The academic sector must also create an innovative environment and work closely together with other research centres and the existing state institutions for development. The future of science – and here I would exclude purely fundamental research – includes active participation in establishing technically innovative zones, technological parks, other innovative business structures and, of course, productive ways of integrating science and education. And I just signed the corresponding federal law on strengthening and developing these last two sectors. I am referring to how to expand the possibilities of academic research, attract young academics from universities, and attract students. And at the same time we need to give universities the possibility to use the equipment that is available for academic institutions.

I think that the Academy of Sciences should engage in the very closest cooperation with the corresponding university departments. They are certainly able and should become a meaningful part of Russia's fundamental science.

I will touch on one other of the programme's main provisions, namely on involving youth in fundamental research. And I think that you will agree with me that youth is in particular need to first and foremost see clear prospects for their academic future, to be interested and engaged in interesting and topical fields, and to have the opportunity to participate directly in international academic exchanges and research.

I am convinced that the academic environment itself is in many ways capable of resolving this problem, especially since material incentives for talented youth are developing, albeit slowly, and that respect for the work and profession of academic is once again increasing in our society.

In addition, at the Council's initiative a federal programme for educating academics and keeping them in the profession to teach and do research has been prepared. It takes into account the years to come and is now being reviewed by the government cabinet. I would draw the cabinet's attention to the fact that this programme should be adopted as soon as possible. As is often the case, it is once again a question of funding – funds need to be allocated to this issue. This is a crucial field in which we cooperate. Adopting this document will allow us to ensure not only the continuity of our scientific traditions but also ensure the necessary renewal of our national fundamental schools.

And there is one more question that I would ask you to think about, to get involved in, and to formulate the corresponding order to the government of the Russian Federation in light of the results of our work today. You need to prepare a programme for the future technological renewal of the fundamental sciences and to strengthen science's technical and technological bases.

However, I would like to draw your attention to one important thing. I agree with cabinet members that this programme should not be narrowly confined to one department, rather it must be broad and all-encompassing. We need to determine what our priorities are, where and what to do. Everything should be worked out in such a format, and adopted and financed in dialogue with the cabinet.

Dear Colleagues! We are in a historic place, in a building that has belonged to the Russian Academy of Sciences for over 70 years. More than one decisions of great importance for national science has been taken in this meeting room. The very establishment of the Academy by Peter the Great was originally intended to be a crucial step towards the creation of powerful intellectual resources in Russia that could significantly strengthen the Russian state and its position in the world. For almost three centuries now, all major academic endeavors have preserved this ideal of serving the public. I expect that academic science, all your colleagues, and all of us will do whatever is necessary to support strategic decisions to ensure Russia's long-term development objectives.",President,Vladimir Putin,http://en.kremlin.ru/events/president/transcripts/statements/24697,,DEVELOPMENT
USA,11-10-2014,Barack Obama,"
Weekly Address: America Is a Place Where Hard Work Should Be Rewarded"," Hi, everybody.  For the first time in more than 6 years, the unemployment rate is below 6%.  Over the past four and a half years, our businesses have created more than 10 million new jobs.  That’s the longest uninterrupted stretch of private sector job creation in our history. 

But while our businesses are creating jobs at the fastest pace since the ‘90s, the typical family hasn’t seen a raise since the ‘90s also.  Folks are feeling as squeezed as ever.  That’s why I’m going to keep pushing policies that will create more jobs faster and raise wages faster – policies like rebuilding our infrastructure, making sure women are paid fairly, and making it easier for young people to pay off their student loans.

But one of the simplest and fastest ways to start helping folks get ahead is by raising the minimum wage.

Ask yourself: could you live on $14,500 a year?  That’s what someone working full-time on the minimum wage makes.  If they’re raising kids, that’s below the poverty line.  And that’s not right.  A hard day’s work deserves a fair day’s pay.

Right now, a worker on the federal minimum wage earns $7.25 an hour.  It’s time to raise that to $10.10 an hour.

Raising the federal minimum wage to ten dollars and ten cents an hour, or ten-ten, would benefit 28 million American workers.  28 million.  And these aren’t just high schoolers on their first job.  The average worker who would benefit is 35 years old.  Most low-wage workers are women.  And that extra money would help them pay the bills and provide for their families.  It also means they’ll have more money to spend at local businesses – which grows the economy for everyone.

But Congress hasn’t voted to raise the minimum wage in seven years.  Seven years.  And when it got a vote earlier this year, Republicans flat-out voted “no.”  That’s why, since the first time I asked Congress to give America a raise, 13 states, 21 cities and D.C. have gone around Congress to raise their workers’ wages.  Five more states have minimum wage initiatives on the ballot next month.  More companies are choosing to raise their workers’ wages.  A recent survey shows that a majority of small business owners support a gradual increase to ten-ten an hour, too.  And I’ve done what I can on my own by requiring federal contractors to pay their workers at least ten-ten an hour. 

On Friday, a coalition of citizens – including business leaders, working moms, labor unions, and more than 65 mayors – told Republicans in Congress to stop blocking a raise for millions of hard-working Americans. Because we believe that in America, nobody who works full-time should ever have to raise a family in poverty.  And I’m going to keep up this fight until we win.  Because America deserves a raise right now.  And America should forever be a place where your hard work is rewarded. 

Thanks, and have a great weekend.",President,Barack Obama,https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/the-press-office/2014/10/11/weekly-address-america-place-where-hard-work-should-be-rewarded,,DEVELOPMENT

Your Excellencies Heads of State and Government,
Your Excellency Dr. Zuma, Chairperson of the African Union Commission,
Dear Colleagues,
Distinguished Guests,
Ladies and Gentlemen,
Dear Friends,

It gives me great pleasure to meet so many African brothers and sisters, who are both old and new friends of mine, in the beautiful Rainbow Nation of South Africa. As co-chair of the Summit, I wish to express my warm welcome to you for attending the Johannesburg Summit of the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation (FOCAC). I also wish to express my sincere appreciation to South Africa, host of the Summit, for the meticulous preparations and thoughtful arrangements it has made for this meeting.

This is my seventh visit to the African continent and also my second visit to Africa after taking office as the Chinese President. Every time I visit Africa, I see new progress and new changes on this continent.

Today's Africa is a continent of encouraging and dynamic development. Africa has actively explored a path of development suited to its conditions and adhered to the principle of solving African issues in the African way. Such a momentum of independent development is unstoppable. Africa has actively advanced industrialization and pursued sustainable self-development. Such a momentum of rapid growth is unstoppable. Africa has accelerated its integration process and speaks in one voice on the international stage. Such a momentum of pursuing strength through unity is unstoppable.

The late President Nelson Mandela of South Africa once said, ""We stand at the dawn of an African century, a century where Africa will take its rightful place among the nations of the world."" I couldn't agree more with this statement, and I am convinced that African countries and people are embracing a new era that is truly theirs.

We in China, both the government and people, heartily rejoice over and are proud of Africa's achievements. We sincerely wish African countries and people greater achievements and an even brighter future in pursuing development and progress.

Dear Colleagues,
Ladies and Gentlemen,

China and Africa share a common future. We Chinese and Africans have forged profound friendship through our common historical experience and in our common struggles.

We have always supported each other in trying times. The Tazara Railway and the Convention Center of the African Union built with Chinese assistance are landmarks of China-Africa friendship. The Chinese government and people took the lead in helping Africa fight Ebola and led the international community in its efforts to assist Africa to combat the epidemic, demonstrating the bond of brotherhood between China and Africa in time of difficulty. On our part, we deeply appreciate the African countries' selfless support to China's return to the United Nations and their donations made to China when China's Wenchuan and Yushu areas were hit by massive earthquakes.

What has made China-Africa friendship durable and vigorous is that our two sides have always been guided by the principle of treating each other as equals, promoting win-win progress and common development and enhancing sincere friendship and cooperation. China and Africa will forever remain good friends, good partners and good brothers.

China and Africa both shoulder the mission of developing our respective countries and improving the livelihood of our peoples. Africa enjoys abundant natural and human resources and has reached the stage of taking off in industrialization. China, after reform and opening-up of over 30 years, now has the technology, equipment, professional and skilled personnel and capital needed to help Africa realize sustainable self-development. In particular, China has the strong political commitment to supporting Africa in achieving development and prosperity. China and Africa share mutual needs and complementarities and face a rare historic opportunity in pursuing development through cooperation.

In the new era, we should carry forward the traditional China-Africa friendship and translate the strengths of our traditional friendship into driving forces to boost solidarity, cooperation and development, so that we will deliver more tangible benefits to our peoples and make greater contribution to the development of the world in a more balanced, just and inclusive manner and to the building of a new model of international partnership based on win-win cooperation.

Dear Colleagues,
Ladies and Gentlemen,

The world is undergoing profound changes. Economic globalization and IT application have tremendously unleashed and advanced social productive forces. We are facing unprecedented opportunities of development. On the other hand, hegemony, terrorism, financial turbulence and environmental crisis have become more pronounced, posing unprecedented challenges to us.

In conducting China's relations with Africa, we adhere to the principles of sincerity, practical results, affinity and good faith and uphold the values of friendship, justice and shared interests, and we will work with our African friends to embrace a new era of win-win cooperation and common development. With this in mind, I propose that the new type of China-Africa strategic partnership be upgraded to a comprehensive strategic and cooperative partnership. To forge this partnership, we should strengthen the following ""five major pillars"".

First, we should remain committed to political equality and mutual trust. A high degree of political mutual trust is the foundation of China-Africa friendship. We should respect each other's choice of development path and not impose one's own will on the other. On issues involving core interests and major concerns of each side, we should show mutual understanding, support each other and jointly uphold equity and justice. China strongly believes that Africa belongs to the African people and that African affairs should be decided by the African people.

Second, we should remain committed to promoting win-win economic cooperation. We Chinese value both friendship and justice as well as shared interests and place more importance on the former. Friendship and justice, which defines China-Africa relations, require us to facilitate Africa's development endeavor with China's development and ultimately deliver win-win progress and common development through mutually beneficial cooperation. We should fully leverage the strengths of political mutual trust and economic complementarities between China and Africa, and focus on industrial capacity cooperation as well as the three networks and industrialization. By doing so, we can deepen China-Africa cooperation in all areas and bring its benefits to our peoples.

Third, we should remain committed to mutually enriching cultural exchanges. Diversity makes the world beautiful. We are proud that both China and Africa have time-honored and splendid civilizations. We should strengthen cultural exchanges and mutual learning between China and Africa, facilitate more exchanges between the youths, women, think tanks, media, universities and other sectors of the two sides, promote cultural interactions, policy coordination and people-to-people exchanges to advance common progress and ensure the sustained growth of China-Africa friendship from generation to generation.

Fourth, we should remain committed to mutual assistance in security. Poverty is the root cause of chaos while peace is the guarantee for development. Development holds the key to solving all problems. China supports the settlement of African issues by Africans in the African way. We are of the view that in resolving security issues, both the symptoms and the root causes must be addressed in a holistic way. China stands ready to take an active part in Africa's efforts in capacity-building for maintaining and strengthening peace and security and support Africa in its endeavors to speed up development, eradicate poverty and realize durable peace.

Fifth, we should remain committed to solidarity and coordination in international affairs. China and Africa share common position on and interests in a wide range of international issues. We should strengthen consultation and coordination so as to make the global governance system more just and equitable and uphold our common interests. China will continue to stand up and speak for Africa at the United Nations and other fora to support Africa in playing a greater role on the world stage.

Dear Colleagues,
Ladies and Gentlemen,

To build China-Africa comprehensive strategic and cooperative partnership, China will implement ten cooperation plans with Africa in the next three years. Guided by the principle of government guidance, businesses being the major actors, market operation and win-win cooperation, these plans aim at addressing three bottleneck issues holding back Africa's development, namely, inadequate infrastructure, lack of professional and skilled personnel, and funding shortage, accelerating Africa's industrialization and agricultural modernization, and achieving sustainable self-development.

First, we will implement China-Africa industrialization plan. China will actively promote industry partnering and production capacity cooperation between China and Africa and encourage more Chinese enterprises to make business investment in Africa. China will build or upgrade a number of industrial parks in cooperation with Africa, send senior government experts and advisers to Africa and set up regional vocational education centers and schools for capacity building. China will also train 200,000 technical personnel and provide 40,000 training opportunities for African personnel in China.

Second, we will implement China-Africa agricultural modernization plan. China will share its experience in agricultural development with Africa and transfer readily applicable technologies to it. We encourage Chinese enterprises to engage in large-scale farming, animal husbandry, and grain storage and processing in Africa to create more local jobs and increase farmers' income. China will carry out agricultural development projects in 100 African villages to raise rural living standards, send 30 teams of agricultural experts to Africa, and establish a ""10+10"" cooperation mechanism between Chinese and African agricultural research institutes. China is greatly concerned about the poor harvest caused by El Nino in many African countries and will provide RMB one billion of emergency food aid to the affected countries.

Third, we will implement China-Africa infrastructure plan. China will step up mutually beneficial cooperation with Africa in infrastructure planning, design, construction, operation, and maintenance. We support Chinese enterprises' active participation in Africa's infrastructural development, particularly in sectors such as railways, roads, regional aviation, ports, electricity and telecommunications, to enhance Africa's capacity for sustainable development. We will also support African countries in establishing five transportation universities.

Fourth, we will implement China-Africa financial plan. China will expand its RMB settlement and currency swap operations with African countries, encourage Chinese financial institutions to set up more branches in Africa, and increase its investment and financing cooperation with Africa in multiple ways to provide financial support and services for Africa's industrialization and modernization drive.

Fifth, we will implement China-Africa green development plan. China will support Africa in bolstering its capacity for green, low-carbon and sustainable development and support Africa in launching 100 projects to develop clean energy, protect wildlife, promote environment-friendly agriculture and build smart cities. China-Africa cooperation will never be pursued at the expense of Africa's eco-system and long-term interests.

Sixth, we will implement China-Africa trade and investment facilitation plan. China will carry out 50 aid-for-trade programs to improve Africa's capacity, both ""software"" and ""hardware"", for conducting internal and external trade and investment. China is ready to negotiate with countries and regional organizations in Africa comprehensive free trade agreements covering trade in goods and services and investment cooperation and it will increase import of African products. China will support African countries in enhancing law enforcement capacity in areas such as customs, quality inspection and taxation. We will also engage in cooperation with Africa in standardization, certification and accreditation and e-commerce.

Seventh, we will implement China-Africa poverty reduction plan. While intensifying its own poverty reduction efforts, China will increase its aid to Africa. We will carry out in Africa 200 ""Happy Life"" projects and poverty reduction programs focusing on women and children. We will cancel outstanding debts in the form of bilateral governmental zero-interest loans borrowed by the relevant least developed African countries that mature at the end of 2015.

Eighth, we will implement China-Africa public health plan. China will help Africa strengthen its public health prevention and control system as well as its capacity building by participating in the building of the African Center for Disease Control. We will support pacesetting cooperation between 20 Chinese hospitals and 20 African hospitals, and upgrade hospital departments. We will continue to send medical teams to Africa and provide medical assistance such as the ""Brightness Action"" program for cataract patients and maternal and child care. We will provide more anti-malaria compound artemisinin to Africa, and encourage and support local drug production by Chinese enterprises in Africa to increase Africans' access to medicine.

Ninth, we will implement China-Africa cultural and people-to-people plan. China will build five cultural centers in Africa and provide satellite TV reception to 10,000 African villages. We will provide to Africa 2,000 educational opportunities with diplomas or degrees and 30,000 government scholarships. Every year, we will sponsor visits by 200 African scholars and study trips by 500 young Africans to China, and train 1,000 media professionals from Africa. We support the opening of more direct flights between China and Africa to boost our tourism cooperation.

Tenth, we will implement China-Africa peace and security plan. China will provide US$60 million of grant to support the building and operation of the African Standby Force and the African Capacity for the Immediate Response to Crisis. China will continue to participate in UN peacekeeping missions in Africa and support African countries' capacity building in areas such as defense, counter-terrorism, riot prevention, customs and immigration control.

To ensure the successful implementation of these ten cooperation plans, China decides to provide a total of US$60 billion of funding support. It includes US$5 billion of grant and zero-interest loans; US$35 billion of loans of concessional nature on more favorable terms and export credit line; an increase of US$5 billion to the China-Africa Development Fund and the Special Loan for the Development of African SMEs respectively; and the China-Africa Fund for Production Capacity Cooperation with an initial contribution of US$10 billion.

Dear Colleagues,
Ladies and Gentlemen,

This year marks the 15th anniversary of FOCAC. The past 15 years have seen fruitful progress in China-Africa practical cooperation across the board. Two-way trade and China's total non-financial investment in Africa in 2014 were 22 times and 60 times that of 2000 respectively, which shows China's contribution to Africa's economic development has risen significantly. FOCAC has become a pacesetter in China-Africa cooperation, an example in South-South cooperation, and a champion for greater international attention to and input in Africa.

China-Africa relations have today reached a stage of growth unmatched in history. We should scale the heights, look afar and take bold steps. Let us join hands, pool the vision and strength of the 2.4 billion Chinese and Africans and open a new era of China-Africa win-win cooperation and common development.

Thank you!",President,Xi Jinping,https://www.fmprc.gov.cn/mfa_eng/wjdt_665385/zyjh_665391/t1321614.shtml,,INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS
USA,22-04-2021 00:00,Joe Biden,Remarks by President Biden at the Virtual Leaders Summit on Climate Opening Session,"THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you, Madam Vice President.
 
Good morning to all of our colleagues around the world — the world leaders who are taking part in this summit.  I thank you.  You know, your leadership on this issue is a statement to the people of your nation and to the people of every nation, especially our young people, that we’re ready to meet this moment.  And meeting this moment is about more than preserving our planet; it’s also about providing a better future for all of us. 
 
That’s why, when people talk about climate, I think jobs.  Within our climate response lies an extraordinary engine of job creation and economic opportunity ready to be fired up.  That’s why I’ve proposed a huge investment in American infrastructure and American innovation to tap the economic opportunity that climate change presents our workers and our communities, especially those too often that have — left out and left behind. 
 
I’d like to buil- — I want to build a — a critical infrastructure to produce and deploy clean technology — both those we can harness today and those that we’ll invent tomorrow.
 
I talked to the experts, and I see the potential for a more prosperous and equitable future.  The signs are unmistakable.  The science is undeniable.  But the cost of inaction is — keeps mounting. 
 
The United States isn’t waiting.  We are resolving to take action — not only the — our federal government, but our cities and our states all across our country; small businesses, large businesses, large corporations; American workers in every field. 
 
I see an opportunity to create millions of good-paying, middle-class, union jobs. 
 
I see line workers laying thousands of miles of transmission lines for a clean, modern, resilient grid. 
 
I see workers capping hundreds of thousands of abandoned oil and gas wells that need to be cleaned up, and abandoned coalmines that need to be reclaimed, putting a stop to the methane leaks and protecting the health of our communities. 
 
I see autoworkers building the next generation of electric vehicles, and electricians installing nationwide for 500,000 charging stations along our highways. 
 
I see engine- — the engineers and the construction workers building new carbon capture and green hydrogen plants to forge cleaner steel and cement and produce clean power. 
 
I see farmers deploying cutting-edge tools to make soil of our — of our Heartland the next frontier in carbon innovation. 
 
By maintaining those investments and putting these people to work, the United States sets out on the road to cut greenhouse gases in half — in half by the end of this decade.  That’s where we’re headed as a nation, and that’s what we can do if we take action to build an economy that’s not only more prosperous, but healthier, fairer, and cleaner for the entire planet. 
 
You know, these steps will set America on a path of net-zero emissions economy by no later than 2050.  But the truth is, America represents less than 15 percent of the world’s emissions.  No nation can solve this crisis on our own, as I know you all fully understand.  All of us, all of us — and particularly those of us who represent the world’s largest economies — we have to step up. 
 
You know, those that do take action and make bold investments in their people and clean energy future will win the good jobs of tomorrow, and make their economies more resilient and more competitive. 
 
So let’s run that race; win more — win more sustainable future than we have now; overcome the existential crisis of our times.  We know just how critically important that is because scientists tell us that this is the decisive decade.  This is the decade we must make decisions that will avoid the worst consequences of a climate crisis.  We must try to keep the Earth’s temperature and — to an increase of — to 1.5 degrees Celsius. 
 
You know, the world beyond 1.5 degrees means more frequent and intense fires, floods, droughts, heat waves, and hurricanes tearing through communities, ripping away lives and livelihoods, increasingly dire impacts to our public health.
 
It’s undeniable and undevi- — you know, the idea of accelerating and the reality that will come if we don’t move.  We can’t resign ourselves to that future.  We have to take action, all of us. 
 
And this summit is our first step on the road we’ll travel together — God willing, all of us — to and through Glasgow this November and the U.N. Climate Conference — the Climate Change Conf- — Conference, you know, to set our world on a path to a secure, prosperous, and sustainable future.  The health of communities throughout the world depends on it.  The wellbeing of our workers depends on it.  The strength of our economies depends on it. 
 
The countries that take decisive action now to create the industries of the future will be the ones that reap the economic benefits of the clean energy boom that’s coming.
 
You know, we’re here at this summit to discuss how each of us, each country, can set higher climate ambitions that will in turn create good-paying jobs, advance innovative technologies, and help vulnerable countries adapt to climate impacts.
 
We have to move.  We have to move quickly to meet these challenges.  The steps our countries take between now and Glasgow will set the world up for success to protect livelihoods around the world and keep global warming at a maximum of 1.5 degrees Celsius.  We must get on the path now in order to do that. 
 
If we do, we’ll breathe easier, literally and figuratively; we’ll create good jobs here at home for millions of Americans; and lay a strong foundation for growth for the future.  And — and that — that can be your goal as well.  This is a moral imperative, an economic imperative, a moment of peril but also a moment of extraordinary possibilities. 
 
Time is short, but I believe we can do this.  And I believe that we will do this. 
 
Thank you for being part of the summit.  Thank you for the communities that you — and the commitments you have made, the communities you’re from.  God bless you all. 
 
And I look forward to progress that we can make together today and beyond.  We really have no choice.  We have to get this done.",President,Joe Biden,https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/speeches-remarks/2021/04/22/remarks-by-president-biden-at-the-virtual-leaders-summit-on-climate-opening-session/,,DEVELOPMENT
Russia,27-10-2003,Vladimir Putin,Speech at a Meeting with Members of the Government,"Good afternoon.

Today I introduced to the State Duma some amendments to the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation. These amendments establish a series of norms that will entail strict liability for anyone involved in human trafficking, especially trafficking children, using slave labour and other corresponding violations of the laws.

Human trafficking is a part of international organised crime. It is one of the most serious and pressing problems we face today, and is unfortunately a particularly urgent issue for us here in Russia. A growing number of Russian citizens, above all women and children, are falling victim to these cynical crimes.

Human trafficking is a form of modern slavery that entails the most brutal and cruel violations of human rights. Experts have calculated that organised crime groups make tens of millions of dollars through human trafficking. There can be no doubt that alongside the proceeds of drug and arms trafficking, this money forms the financial basis supporting international terrorism.

Russian criminal legislation does not address this problem with any systemic sort of regulation, which paves the way for such dangerous phenomena as human trafficking to go unpunished. The new amendments will fill this gap in the legislation. I call on the heads of the law enforcement agencies to give this problem their fullest attention and use all means and opportunities the law provides to combat this evil.

First, I would like to point out that these amendments provide for quite tough sanctions of up to 15 years imprisonment, and I especially want to make clear that the law will punish those who make a living from exploiting people, and not those who, after finding themselves in difficult moments in life, end up in the filthy hands of slave traders.

The second thing I wanted to say on the law enforcement theme is that in connection with the arrest of the head of the company Yukos the leadership of the Russian Union of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs and also several political figures have requested a meeting with me.

I hold regular and systematic meetings with the representatives of political parties, with employers’ and trade union leaders and with business community representatives. These meetings are useful and necessary and they will continue in the future. But there will be no meetings and no bargaining over the law enforcement agencies and their activities, so long, of course, as these agencies are acting within the limits of Russian legislation.

It is true that we still have much to do to improve law enforcement work. But the country has adopted a democratic and legally regulated system of taking decisions in the criminal law sphere.

Neither the executive authorities nor even the Prosecutor’s Office can deprive someone of their freedom, even for the period of pre-trial detention. Only the court has this power. If, in this particular case, the court has made this decision, then I assume that it had reasons for doing so. In any case, it is up to those who think someone is guilty to prove so, but in the end, only the court has the power to decide, and before the court, as before the law, all should be equal, from the humblest clerk to the highest state official, as was the case, for example, with a federal government minister, or rather, former minister. Everyone should be equal before the law, whether ordinary citizen or middling entrepreneur or big businessman, and no matter how many billions of dollars they may have in their personal or corporate accounts. Without this equality we will never manage to build an economically effective and socially regulated tax system. We would never be able to teach people to pay their taxes, make them pay their taxes, ensure contributions to the social and pension funds. And we would never be able to break the back of organised crime and corruption.

Some countries have set up special systems to fight corruption, and I think it would be good for us to do likewise. I request the Government and will give the corresponding instructions to the Presidential Executive Office to come up with a corresponding proposal in this area in two weeks.

At the same time, I do understand the business community’s concern because any action taken by the federal authorities often gets turned into some kind of campaign. I must make it clear that the Yukos case should in no way be seen as setting a precedent or giving rise to analogies and generalisations regarding the results of previous privatisations, and I would ask therefore that all speculation and hysteria on this issue come to an end and that the Government not get drawn into this debate.

We will now take up economic matters. I know that the Government is preparing amendments to the Land Code to deal with a situation when the business community and entrepreneurs are unable in time to recategorise their land from perpetual use to lease or ownership in accordance with the land law. I have recently met with the Patriarch, and he said religious organisations had the same problems. I request that the Government bear this in mind when drafting its decisions. That was all I wanted to tell you at the beginning, and now let us exchange information about current problems. I would like to give the floor to Agriculture Minister Alexei Gordeyev.

Weekly Address: Ensuring Americans Feel the Gains of a Growing Economy"," Hi, everybody.  Just in time for the holiday season, we now have another piece of good news about the pace of our economic recovery.

Last month, our businesses created 314,000 new jobs.  And that’s not a fluke – it keeps up the solid pace of job creation we’ve seen all year long.  November was the tenth month in a row we’ve added more than 200,000 jobs.  So far this year, our economy has created 2.65 million new jobs.  That’s the most of any year since the 1990s – even with a full month to go.  All told, our businesses have created 10.9 million new jobs over the past 57 months.  And that’s the longest streak of private-sector job creation on record.

We also know that the upswing in job growth this year has come in industries with higher wages.  Overall wages are on the rise.  And that’s some very welcome news for millions of hardworking Americans.  Because even though corporate profits and the stock market have hit all-time highs, the typical family isn’t bringing home more than they did 15 years ago.  And that still has to change.  And a vibrant jobs market gives us the opportunity to keep up this progress, and begin to undo that decades-long middle-class squeeze. 

But first, we need the outgoing Congress to pass a budget and keep our government open.  A Christmas shutdown is not a good idea.  Then, when the new Congress convenes in January, we need to work together to invest in the things that support faster growth in higher-paying jobs.

Building new roads and bridges creates jobs.  Growing our exports creates jobs.  Reforming our outdated tax system and our broken immigration system creates jobs. Raising the minimum wage would benefit nearly 28 million American workers, giving them more money to spend at local businesses – and that helps those businesses create jobs. 

America, we still have a lot of work to do together.  But we do have real, tangible evidence of our progress.  10.9 million new jobs.  10 million more Americans with health insurance.  Manufacturing has grown.  Our deficits have shrunk.  Our dependence on foreign oil is down.  Clean energy is up.  More young Americans are graduating from high school and earning college degrees than ever before.  Over the last four years, this country has put more people back to work than Europe, Japan, and every advanced economy combined. 

The United States of America continues to outperform much of the world.  And we are going to keep it up until every American feels the gains of a growing economy where it matters most – in your own lives. 

Thanks, and have a great weekend.",President,Barack Obama,https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/the-press-office/2014/12/06/weekly-address-ensuring-americans-feel-gains-growing-economy,,DEVELOPMENT

I had a choice of having a beautiful, very fancy lunch, and I said, no, I want to eat with the troops. And we ate with the troops. And it was good eating. It was good eating. And I tell you, they’ve done a terrific job. Very impressive.

And we have a very strong schedule today and, actually, for the next nine days. As you know, we just got back from Japan where we had a very successful two days. Today will be pretty busy and tomorrow also. And then we head to China. And I look forward to that.

There’s great cooperation. We have a terrific meeting scheduled on trade in a little while with President Moon and his representatives. And we will — hopefully, that will start working out, and working out so that we create lots of jobs in the United States, which is one the reasons — one of the very important reasons I’m here.

In addition to that, we’ll be meeting with the various generals — General Brooks and the various generals — about the situation in North Korea. And I think we’re going to have lots of good answers for you over a period of time, and ultimately it will all work out. Because it always works out — has to work out.

So I want to thank you all for being here. We appreciate it. Thank you very much. We’re going to see you in a little while. And I think about 4:30, we’re going to be separately meeting with you.

But we appreciate it. I hope you had a good flight here. Many of you were on the flight with me, so I know it was pretty good. And I think you’re probably just as impressed as I am. This is a very impressive group of people, beyond facilities — people. These are very impressive people.

USA,05-12-2015,Barack Obama,"
WEEKLY ADDRESS: We Will Not Be Terrorized"," Hi, everybody.  This weekend, our hearts are with the people of San Bernardino—another American community shattered by unspeakable violence.  We salute the first responders—the police, the SWAT teams, the EMTs—who responded so quickly, with such courage, and saved lives.  We pray for the injured as they fight to recover from their wounds.

Most of all, we stand with 14 families whose hearts are broken.  We’re learning more about their loved ones—the men and women, the beautiful lives, that were lost.  They were doing what so many of us do this time of year—enjoying the holidays.  Celebrating with each other.  Rejoicing in the bonds of friendship and community that bind us together, as Americans.  Their deaths are an absolute tragedy, not just for San Bernardino, but for our country.

We’re also learning more about the killers.  And we’re working to get a full picture of their motives—why they committed these revolting acts.  It’s important to let the investigators do their job.  We need to know all the facts.  And at my direction, federal law enforcement is helping in every way that they can.  We’re going to get to the bottom of this.

It is entirely possible that these two attackers were radicalized to commit this act of terror. And if so, it would underscore a threat we’ve been focused on for years—the danger of people succumbing to violent extremist ideologies.  We know that ISIL and other terrorist groups are actively encouraging people—around the world and in our country—to commit terrible acts of violence, often times as lone wolf actors.  And even as we work to prevent attacks, all of us—government, law enforcement, communities, faith leaders—need to work together to prevent people from falling victim to these hateful ideologies.

More broadly, this tragedy reminds us of our obligation to do everything in our power, together, to keep our communities safe.  We know that the killers in San Bernardino used military-style assault weapons—weapons of war—to kill as many people as they could.  It’s another tragic reminder that here in America it’s way too easy for dangerous people to get their hands on a gun.

For example, right now, people on the No-Fly list can walk into a store and buy a gun.  That is insane.  If you’re too dangerous to board a plane, you’re too dangerous, by definition, to buy a gun.  And so I’m calling on Congress to close this loophole, now.  We may not be able to prevent every tragedy, but—at a bare minimum—we shouldn’t be making it so easy for potential terrorists or criminals to get their hands on a gun that they could use against Americans.

Today in San Bernardino, investigators are searching for answers.  Across our country, our law enforcement professionals are tireless.  They’re working around the clock—as always—to protect our communities.  As President, my highest priority is the security and safety of the American people.  This is work that should unite us all—as Americans—so that we’re doing everything in our power to defend our country.  That’s how we can honor the lives we lost in San Bernardino.  That’s how we can send a message to all those who would try to hurt us.  We are Americans.  We will uphold our values—a free and open society.  We are strong.   And we are resilient.  And we will not be terrorized.",President,Barack Obama,https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/the-press-office/2015/12/05/weekly-address-we-will-not-be-terrorized,,EXTREMISM
USA,29-05-2017 00:00,Donald Trump,Remarks by President Trump at Arlington National Cemetery,"THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you so much.  And thank you, General Dunford and Secretary Mattis, for your moving words and for your service to our great nation.  Vice President Pence, Cabinet Secretaries, members of Congress, members of the Armed Forces and veterans — thank you for joining us as we honor the brave warriors who gave their lives for ours, spending their last moments on this Earth in defense of this country and of its people.

Words cannot measure the depth of their devotion, the purity of their love, or the totality of their courage.  We only hope that every day we can prove worthy not only of their sacrifice and service but of the sacrifice made by the families and loved ones they left behind.  Special, special people.

I especially want to extend our gratitude to Secretary John Kelly for joining us today.  Incredible man.  (Applause.)  I always like to call him General.  He understands more than most ever could or ever will the wounds and burdens of war.  Not only did Secretary proudly serve in the military for more than 40 years, enduring many hardships, but he and his incredible wife Karen have borne the single most difficult hardship of them all
— the loss of their son, Robert, in service to our country.  Robert died fighting the enemies of all civilizations in Afghanistan.

To John, Karen, Heather, Kate, Andrea and the entire Kelly family, today 300 million American hearts are joined together with yours.  We grieve with you.  We honor you.  And we pledge to you that we will always remember Robert and what he did for all of us.  Thank you, John.  (Applause.)

The Kelly family represents military families across the country who carry the burden of freedom on their shoulders. Secretary Kelly is joined today by his son-in-law, Jake, a Wounded Warrior.  And the Secretary’s son, Johnnie, will soon leave on his fifth deployment.  It is because of families like yours that all of our families can live in safety and live in peace.

To every Gold Star family who honors us with your presence, you lost sons and daughters, husbands and wives, mothers and fathers.  They each had their own names, their own stories, their own beautiful dreams.  But they were all angels sent to us by God, and they all share one title in common — and that is the title of hero.  (Applause.)  Real heroes.  Though they were here only a brief time before God called them home, their legacy will endure forever.

General Douglas MacArthur once said that “the soldier who is called upon to offer and to give his life for his country is the noblest development of mankind.”  Here at this hallowed shrine, we honor the noblest among us — the men and women who paid the ultimate price for victory and for freedom.  We pay tribute to those brave souls who raced into gunfire, roared into battle, and ran into hell to face down evil.  They made their sacrifice not for fame, or for money, or even for glory — but for country.

We are privileged to be joined today by a man whose life demonstrates the values of service and sacrifice:  Senator Bob Dole, here with his wife, Senator Elizabeth Dole.  (Applause.)   Senator Dole fought bravely in World War II, and was severely wounded by German fire.  In just a few weeks, Bob will be celebrating his 94th birthday.  (Applause.)

And, Bob, I know I speak for millions of grateful Americans when I say thank you.  (Applause.)  Thank you, Bob.  We thank you not only for your service, but for helping us to remember your fallen comrades and the countless American patriots who gave their lives in the Second World War.

Since the first volley of gunfire in the Revolution, brave Americans in every generation have answered the call of duty and won victory for freedom in its hour of need.  Today, a new generation of American patriots are fighting to win the battle against terrorism — risking their lives to protect our citizens from an enemy that uses the murder of innocents to wage war on humanity itself.

We are joined today by the wife of Specialist Christopher Horton, who rests on these so beautiful grounds.  As Jane tells us, Chris “was a man who loved his country with every part of his being.”
In 2008, Chris enlisted in the Oklahoma Army National Guard.  He trained as a sniper, becoming known as one of the best shots anywhere at any time.  He was a talented, tough guy.  While Chris was in the National Guard, he was also a volunteer police officer.  In everything he did, he was thinking about how he could serve God, serve his family and serve his country.

In 2011, he deployed for the first time to Afghanistan. Chris knew his job was one of the most dangerous there was, but he was determined to go after the enemy at any cost to himself.  His missions helped target and kill terrorists who sought to destroy innocent people.  Just three months into his first deployment, Chris was near the Pakistan border, trying to eliminate an enemy cell that was doing so much damage and that was planting deadly roadside bombs against his unit and the units of many others.  Standing watch with his comrades, he died in the ensuing gun battle with enemy forces.  Chris sacrificed his life to protect his fellow soldiers — and to protect all Americans.  He was awarded the Purple Heart and Bronze Star for his courage. At only 26 years old, Chris secured his place in our hearts for eternity.

Jane, America, grieves with you.  Our whole entire nation sends you our support, our strength, and our deep, deep love.  You lost your husband, and America lost a hero.  And together, we will preserve his memory — today, tomorrow, and always.  Thank you, Jane.  (Applause.)  Thank you, Jane.  Thank you, Jane.  (Applause.)  Thank you, Jane.

We are also joined today by David and Rose Byers, the parents of Major Andrew Byers.  As a boy, Andrew dreamed of the chance to attend the United States Military Academy at West Point.  He worked hard, he earned that chance, and he graduated at the top of his class.  He became the commander of a Special HALO team, leading his fellow soldiers out of aircraft, hurtling into dangerous and unknown territory.

About this time last year, Andrew was sent on his third combat deployment.  This time he went to Afghanistan.  On November 3rd, he was one of 10 Special Forces operators to land by helicopter near a Taliban safe haven in northern Afghanistan. They trekked through a mile of waist-deep mud and climbed a steep cliff before finally reaching the village that they wanted to reach.  There, a night-long battle ensued.  Andrew and his team fought off wave after wave after wave of enemy fighters.  A grenade detonated, and as the Taliban began to surround the American and Afghan forces, Andrew ran through the smoke and through the hail of bullets to rescue an Afghan soldier.  In the midst of this torrent of gunfire and danger, Andrew worked heroically to open a gateway and get his men to safety — risking his life to save theirs.  And he did it.  Unbelievably, he did.  But in saving those lives, Andrew was killed right then and there by enemy fire.  Andrew has since been awarded the Silver Star for gallantry in battle.

To his parents, David and Rose, we stand in awe of your son and his courageous sacrifice.  On behalf of the American people, I express to you our everlasting gratitude for what your son did for his country, for his comrades, and for all of us.

Andrew’s father has said that he holds on to the promise of Joshua Chapter 1, Verse 9:  “The Lord your God will be with you wherever you go.”   Thank you.  Thank you.  (Applause.)  Thank you.  Thank you.  (Applause.)  What a man he was.

To every Gold Star family, God is with you, and your loved ones are with Him.  They died in wars so that we could live in peace.  I believe that God has a special place in heaven for those who laid down their lives so that others may live free from fear and this horrible oppression.

Now let us pledge to make the most of that freedom that they so gallantly and brilliantly fought for and they died to protect. Let us also pledge to tell the stories of Robert, Chris, Andrew, and all of America’s fallen warriors today and for the next 1,000 years.  (Applause.)

And while we cannot know the extent of your pain, what we do know is that our gratitude to them and to you is boundless and undying.  Boundless and undying.  We’ll always be there.  Thank you.  (Applause.)  Their stories are now woven into the soul of our nation, into the Stars and Stripes on our flag, and into the beating hearts of our great, great people.

Today we also hold a special vigil for heroes whose story we cannot tell because their names are known to God alone — the unknown soldiers.  We do not know where they came from, who they left behind, or what they hoped to be.  But we do know what they did.  They fought and they died in a great and noble act of loyalty and love to their families and to our country.

The letter written that is now famous — one Civil War soldier captured it all and for all time.  He wrote to his wife, “If I do not return, my dear Sarah, never forget how much I love you, nor that when my last breath escapes me on the battlefield, it will whisper your name.”  That is the love we hear whispering throughout this sacred place and from every tombstone on these hallowed grounds.  It is the love that binds this earth beneath us and it bleeds from the hearts of all of those who died so that we might live free.

We can never replace them.  We can never repay them.  But we can always remember.  And today, that is what we are doing — we remember.  Words cannot wipe away the tears or bring back those smiling faces.  But if Americans just take the time to look into your eyes and tell you how much we thank you and how dearly we pray for you and how truly we love you, then hopefully you can find solace through your pain.  And every time you see the sun rise over this blessed land please know your brave sons and daughters pushed away the night and delivered for us all that great and glorious dawn.

Thank you.  God bless you.  God bless our fallen heroes.  God bless their families.  God bless our military.  And God bless the United States of America.

USA,28-03-2015,Barack Obama,"
Weekly Address: Protecting Working Americans’ Paychecks"," Hi, everybody.  Five years ago, after the worst financial crisis in decades, we passed historic Wall Street reform to end the era of bailouts and too big to fail. 

As part that reform, we created an independent Consumer Financial Protection Bureau with one mission: to protect American consumers from some of the worst practices of the financial industry. 

They’ve already put $5 billion back in the pockets of more than 15 million families.  And this week, they took an important first step towards cracking down on some of the most abusive practices involving payday loans. 

Millions of Americans take out these loans every year.  In Alabama, where I visited this week, there are four times as many payday lending stores as there are McDonald’s.  But while payday loans might seem like easy money, folks often end up trapped in a cycle of debt.  If you take out a $500 loan, it’s easy to wind up paying more than $1,000 in interest and fees. 

The step the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau announced this week is designed to change that.  The idea is pretty common sense: if you’re a payday lender preparing to give a loan, you should make sure that the borrower can afford to pay it back first. 

As Americans, we believe there’s nothing wrong with making a profit.  But there is something wrong with making that profit by trapping hard-working men and women in a vicious cycle of debt.  

Protecting working Americans’ paychecks shouldn’t be a partisan issue.  But the budget Republicans unveiled last week would make it harder, not easier, to crack down on financial fraud and abuse.  And this week, when Republicans rolled out their next economic idea, it had nothing to do with the middle class.  It was a new, more-than-$250 billion tax cut for the top one-tenth of the top one percent of Americans.  That would mean handing out an average tax cut of $4 million a year to just 4,000 Americans per year, and leaving the rest of the country to pay for it. 

I don’t think our top economic priority should be helping a tiny number of Americans who are already doing extraordinarily well, and asking everybody else to foot the bill.  I think our top priority should be helping everybody who works hard get ahead.  This country does best when everyone gets their fair shot, everyone does their fair share, and everyone plays by the same set of rules. 

That’s what middle-class economics is all about, and as long as I’m your President, that’s what I’ll keep on fighting to do.

Thanks, and have a great weekend.",President,Barack Obama,https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/the-press-office/2015/03/28/weekly-address-protecting-working-americans-paychecks,,DEVELOPMENT
USA,19-09-2017 00:00,Donald Trump,Remarks by President Trump to the 72nd Session of the United Nations General Assembly,"PRESIDENT TRUMP:  Mr. Secretary General, Mr. President, world leaders, and distinguished delegates:  Welcome to New York.  It is a profound honor to stand here in my home city, as a representative of the American people, to address the people of the world.

As millions of our citizens continue to suffer the effects of the devastating hurricanes that have struck our country, I want to begin by expressing my appreciation to every leader in this room who has offered assistance and aid.  The American people are strong and resilient, and they will emerge from these hardships more determined than ever before.

Fortunately, the United States has done very well since Election Day last November 8th.  The stock market is at an all-time high — a record.  Unemployment is at its lowest level in 16 years, and because of our regulatory and other reforms, we have more people working in the United States today than ever before.  Companies are moving back, creating job growth the likes of which our country has not seen in a very long time.  And it has just been announced that we will be spending almost $700 billion on our military and defense.

Our military will soon be the strongest it has ever been.  For more than 70 years, in times of war and peace, the leaders of nations, movements, and religions have stood before this assembly.  Like them, I intend to address some of the very serious threats before us today but also the enormous potential waiting to be unleashed.

We live in a time of extraordinary opportunity.  Breakthroughs in science, technology, and medicine are curing illnesses and solving problems that prior generations thought impossible to solve.

But each day also brings news of growing dangers that threaten everything we cherish and value.  Terrorists and extremists have gathered strength and spread to every region of the planet.  Rogue regimes represented in this body not only support terrorists but threaten other nations and their own people with the most destructive weapons known to humanity.

Authority and authoritarian powers seek to collapse the values, the systems, and alliances that prevented conflict and tilted the world toward freedom since World War II.

International criminal networks traffic drugs, weapons, people; force dislocation and mass migration; threaten our borders; and new forms of aggression exploit technology to menace our citizens.

To put it simply, we meet at a time of both of immense promise and great peril.  It is entirely up to us whether we lift the world to new heights, or let it fall into a valley of disrepair.

We have it in our power, should we so choose, to lift millions from poverty, to help our citizens realize their dreams, and to ensure that new generations of children are raised free from violence, hatred, and fear.

This institution was founded in the aftermath of two world wars to help shape this better future.  It was based on the vision that diverse nations could cooperate to protect their sovereignty, preserve their security, and promote their prosperity.

It was in the same period, exactly 70 years ago, that the United States developed the Marshall Plan to help restore Europe.  Those three beautiful pillars — they’re pillars of peace, sovereignty, security, and prosperity.

The Marshall Plan was built on the noble idea that the whole world is safer when nations are strong, independent, and free.  As President Truman said in his message to Congress at that time, “Our support of European recovery is in full accord with our support of the United Nations.  The success of the United Nations depends upon the independent strength of its members.”

To overcome the perils of the present and to achieve the promise of the future, we must begin with the wisdom of the past.  Our success depends on a coalition of strong and independent nations that embrace their sovereignty to promote security, prosperity, and peace for themselves and for the world.

We do not expect diverse countries to share the same cultures, traditions, or even systems of government.  But we do expect all nations to uphold these two core sovereign duties:  to respect the interests of their own people and the rights of every other sovereign nation.  This is the beautiful vision of this institution, and this is foundation for cooperation and success.

Strong, sovereign nations let diverse countries with different values, different cultures, and different dreams not just coexist, but work side by side on the basis of mutual respect.

Strong, sovereign nations let their people take ownership of the future and control their own destiny.  And strong, sovereign nations allow individuals to flourish in the fullness of the life intended by God.

In America, we do not seek to impose our way of life on anyone, but rather to let it shine as an example for everyone to watch.  This week gives our country a special reason to take pride in that example.  We are celebrating the 230th anniversary of our beloved Constitution — the oldest constitution still in use in the world today.

This timeless document has been the foundation of peace, prosperity, and freedom for the Americans and for countless millions around the globe whose own countries have found inspiration in its respect for human nature, human dignity, and the rule of law.

The greatest in the United States Constitution is its first three beautiful words.  They are:  “We the people.”

Generations of Americans have sacrificed to maintain the promise of those words, the promise of our country, and of our great history.  In America, the people govern, the people rule, and the people are sovereign.  I was elected not to take power, but to give power to the American people, where it belongs.

In foreign affairs, we are renewing this founding principle of sovereignty.  Our government’s first duty is to its people, to our citizens — to serve their needs, to ensure their safety, to preserve their rights, and to defend their values.

As President of the United States, I will always put America first, just like you, as the leaders of your countries will always, and should always, put your countries first.  (Applause.)

All responsible leaders have an obligation to serve their own citizens, and the nation-state remains the best vehicle for elevating the human condition.

But making a better life for our people also requires us to work together in close harmony and unity to create a more safe and peaceful future for all people.

The United States will forever be a great friend to the world, and especially to its allies.  But we can no longer be taken advantage of, or enter into a one-sided deal where the United States gets nothing in return.  As long as I hold this office, I will defend America’s interests above all else.

But in fulfilling our obligations to our own nations, we also realize that it’s in everyone’s interest to seek a future where all nations can be sovereign, prosperous, and secure.

America does more than speak for the values expressed in the United Nations Charter.  Our citizens have paid the ultimate price to defend our freedom and the freedom of many nations represented in this great hall.  America’s devotion is measured on the battlefields where our young men and women have fought and sacrificed alongside of our allies, from the beaches of Europe to the deserts of the Middle East to the jungles of Asia.

It is an eternal credit to the American character that even after we and our allies emerged victorious from the bloodiest war in history, we did not seek territorial expansion, or attempt to oppose and impose our way of life on others.  Instead, we helped build institutions such as this one to defend the sovereignty, security, and prosperity for all.

For the diverse nations of the world, this is our hope.  We want harmony and friendship, not conflict and strife.  We are guided by outcomes, not ideology.  We have a policy of principled realism, rooted in shared goals, interests, and values.

That realism forces us to confront a question facing every leader and nation in this room.  It is a question we cannot escape or avoid.  We will slide down the path of complacency, numb to the challenges, threats, and even wars that we face.  Or do we have enough strength and pride to confront those dangers today, so that our citizens can enjoy peace and prosperity tomorrow?

If we desire to lift up our citizens, if we aspire to the approval of history, then we must fulfill our sovereign duties to the people we faithfully represent.  We must protect our nations, their interests, and their futures.  We must reject threats to sovereignty, from the Ukraine to the South China Sea.  We must uphold respect for law, respect for borders, and respect for culture, and the peaceful engagement these allow.  And just as the founders of this body intended, we must work together and confront together those who threaten us with chaos, turmoil, and terror.

The scourge of our planet today is a small group of rogue regimes that violate every principle on which the United Nations is based.  They respect neither their own citizens nor the sovereign rights of their countries.

If the righteous many do not confront the wicked few, then evil will triumph.  When decent people and nations become bystanders to history, the forces of destruction only gather power and strength.

No one has shown more contempt for other nations and for the wellbeing of their own people than the depraved regime in North Korea.  It is responsible for the starvation deaths of millions of North Koreans, and for the imprisonment, torture, killing, and oppression of countless more.

We were all witness to the regime’s deadly abuse when an innocent American college student, Otto Warmbier, was returned to America only to die a few days later.  We saw it in the assassination of the dictator’s brother using banned nerve agents in an international airport.  We know it kidnapped a sweet 13-year-old Japanese girl from a beach in her own country to enslave her as a language tutor for North Korea’s spies.

If this is not twisted enough, now North Korea’s reckless pursuit of nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles threatens the entire world with unthinkable loss of human life.

It is an outrage that some nations would not only trade with such a regime, but would arm, supply, and financially support a country that imperils the world with nuclear conflict.  No nation on earth has an interest in seeing this band of criminals arm itself with nuclear weapons and missiles.

The United States has great strength and patience, but if it is forced to defend itself or its allies, we will have no choice but to totally destroy North Korea.  Rocket Man is on a suicide mission for himself and for his regime.  The United States is ready, willing and able, but hopefully this will not be necessary.  That’s what the United Nations is all about; that’s what the United Nations is for.  Let’s see how they do.

It is time for North Korea to realize that the denuclearization is its only acceptable future.  The United Nations Security Council recently held two unanimous 15-0 votes adopting hard-hitting resolutions against North Korea, and I want to thank China and Russia for joining the vote to impose sanctions, along with all of the other members of the Security Council.  Thank you to all involved.

But we must do much more.  It is time for all nations to work together to isolate the Kim regime until it ceases its hostile behavior.

We face this decision not only in North Korea.  It is far past time for the nations of the world to confront another reckless regime — one that speaks openly of mass murder, vowing death to America, destruction to Israel, and ruin for many leaders and nations in this room.

The Iranian government masks a corrupt dictatorship behind the false guise of a democracy.  It has turned a wealthy country with a rich history and culture into an economically depleted rogue state whose chief exports are violence, bloodshed, and chaos.  The longest-suffering victims of Iran’s leaders are, in fact, its own people.

Rather than use its resources to improve Iranian lives, its oil profits go to fund Hezbollah and other terrorists that kill innocent Muslims and attack their peaceful Arab and Israeli neighbors.  This wealth, which rightly belongs to Iran’s people, also goes to shore up Bashar al-Assad’s dictatorship, fuel Yemen’s civil war, and undermine peace throughout the entire Middle East.

We cannot let a murderous regime continue these destabilizing activities while building dangerous missiles, and we cannot abide by an agreement if it provides cover for the eventual construction of a nuclear program.  (Applause.)  The Iran Deal was one of the worst and most one-sided transactions the United States has ever entered into.  Frankly, that deal is an embarrassment to the United States, and I don’t think you’ve heard the last of it — believe me.

It is time for the entire world to join us in demanding that Iran’s government end its pursuit of death and destruction.  It is time for the regime to free all Americans and citizens of other nations that they have unjustly detained.  And above all, Iran’s government must stop supporting terrorists, begin serving its own people, and respect the sovereign rights of its neighbors.

The entire world understands that the good people of Iran want change, and, other than the vast military power of the United States, that Iran’s people are what their leaders fear the most.  This is what causes the regime to restrict Internet access, tear down satellite dishes, shoot unarmed student protestors, and imprison political reformers.

Oppressive regimes cannot endure forever, and the day will come when the Iranian people will face a choice.  Will they continue down the path of poverty, bloodshed, and terror?  Or will the Iranian people return to the nation’s proud roots as a center of civilization, culture, and wealth where their people can be happy and prosperous once again?

The Iranian regime’s support for terror is in stark contrast to the recent commitments of many of its neighbors to fight terrorism and halt its financing.

In Saudi Arabia early last year, I was greatly honored to address the leaders of more than 50 Arab and Muslim nations.  We agreed that all responsible nations must work together to confront terrorists and the Islamist extremism that inspires them.

We will stop radical Islamic terrorism because we cannot allow it to tear up our nation, and indeed to tear up the entire world.

We must deny the terrorists safe haven, transit, funding, and any form of support for their vile and sinister ideology.  We must drive them out of our nations.  It is time to expose and hold responsible those countries who support and finance terror groups like al Qaeda, Hezbollah, the Taliban and others that slaughter innocent people.

The United States and our allies are working together throughout the Middle East to crush the loser terrorists and stop the reemergence of safe havens they use to launch attacks on all of our people.

Last month, I announced a new strategy for victory in the fight against this evil in Afghanistan.  From now on, our security interests will dictate the length and scope of military operations, not arbitrary benchmarks and timetables set up by politicians.

I have also totally changed the rules of engagement in our fight against the Taliban and other terrorist groups.  In Syria and Iraq, we have made big gains toward lasting defeat of ISIS.  In fact, our country has achieved more against ISIS in the last eight months than it has in many, many years combined.

We seek the de-escalation of the Syrian conflict, and a political solution that honors the will of the Syrian people.  The actions of the criminal regime of Bashar al-Assad, including the use of chemical weapons against his own citizens — even innocent children — shock the conscience of every decent person.  No society can be safe if banned chemical weapons are allowed to spread.  That is why the United States carried out a missile strike on the airbase that launched the attack.

We appreciate the efforts of United Nations agencies that are providing vital humanitarian assistance in areas liberated from ISIS, and we especially thank Jordan, Turkey and Lebanon for their role in hosting refugees from the Syrian conflict.

The United States is a compassionate nation and has spent billions and billions of dollars in helping to support this effort.  We seek an approach to refugee resettlement that is designed to help these horribly treated people, and which enables their eventual return to their home countries, to be part of the rebuilding process.

For the cost of resettling one refugee in the United States, we can assist more than 10 in their home region.  Out of the goodness of our hearts, we offer financial assistance to hosting countries in the region, and we support recent agreements of the G20 nations that will seek to host refugees as close to their home countries as possible.  This is the safe, responsible, and humanitarian approach.

For decades, the United States has dealt with migration challenges here in the Western Hemisphere.  We have learned that, over the long term, uncontrolled migration is deeply unfair to both the sending and the receiving countries.

For the sending countries, it reduces domestic pressure to pursue needed political and economic reform, and drains them of the human capital necessary to motivate and implement those reforms.

For the receiving countries, the substantial costs of uncontrolled migration are borne overwhelmingly by low-income citizens whose concerns are often ignored by both media and government.

I want to salute the work of the United Nations in seeking to address the problems that cause people to flee from their homes.  The United Nations and African Union led peacekeeping missions to have invaluable contributions in stabilizing conflicts in Africa.  The United States continues to lead the world in humanitarian assistance, including famine prevention and relief in South Sudan, Somalia, and northern Nigeria and Yemen.

We have invested in better health and opportunity all over the world through programs like PEPFAR, which funds AIDS relief; the President’s Malaria Initiative; the Global Health Security Agenda; the Global Fund to End Modern Slavery; and the Women Entrepreneurs Finance Initiative, part of our commitment to empowering women all across the globe.

We also thank — (applause) — we also thank the Secretary General for recognizing that the United Nations must reform if it is to be an effective partner in confronting threats to sovereignty, security, and prosperity.  Too often the focus of this organization has not been on results, but on bureaucracy and process.

In some cases, states that seek to subvert this institution’s noble aims have hijacked the very systems that are supposed to advance them.  For example, it is a massive source of embarrassment to the United Nations that some governments with egregious human rights records sit on the U.N. Human Rights Council.

The United States is one out of 193 countries in the United Nations, and yet we pay 22 percent of the entire budget and more.  In fact, we pay far more than anybody realizes.  The United States bears an unfair cost burden, but, to be fair, if it could actually accomplish all of its stated goals, especially the goal of peace, this investment would easily be well worth it.

Major portions of the world are in conflict and some, in fact, are going to hell.  But the powerful people in this room, under the guidance and auspices of the United Nations, can solve many of these vicious and complex problems.

The American people hope that one day soon the United Nations can be a much more accountable and effective advocate for human dignity and freedom around the world.  In the meantime, we believe that no nation should have to bear a disproportionate share of the burden, militarily or financially.  Nations of the world must take a greater role in promoting secure and prosperous societies in their own regions.

That is why in the Western Hemisphere, the United States has stood against the corrupt and destabilizing regime in Cuba and embraced the enduring dream of the Cuban people to live in freedom.  My administration recently announced that we will not lift sanctions on the Cuban government until it makes fundamental reforms.

We have also imposed tough, calibrated sanctions on the socialist Maduro regime in Venezuela, which has brought a once thriving nation to the brink of total collapse.

The socialist dictatorship of Nicolas Maduro has inflicted terrible pain and suffering on the good people of that country.  This corrupt regime destroyed a prosperous nation by imposing a failed ideology that has produced poverty and misery everywhere it has been tried.  To make matters worse, Maduro has defied his own people, stealing power from their elected representatives to preserve his disastrous rule.

The Venezuelan people are starving and their country is collapsing.  Their democratic institutions are being destroyed.  This situation is completely unacceptable and we cannot stand by and watch.

As a responsible neighbor and friend, we and all others have a goal.  That goal is to help them regain their freedom, recover their country, and restore their democracy.  I would like to thank leaders in this room for condemning the regime and providing vital support to the Venezuelan people.

The United States has taken important steps to hold the regime accountable.  We are prepared to take further action if the government of Venezuela persists on its path to impose authoritarian rule on the Venezuelan people.

We are fortunate to have incredibly strong and healthy trade relationships with many of the Latin American countries gathered here today.  Our economic bond forms a critical foundation for advancing peace and prosperity for all of our people and all of our neighbors.

I ask every country represented here today to be prepared to do more to address this very real crisis.  We call for the full restoration of democracy and political freedoms in Venezuela. (Applause.)

The problem in Venezuela is not that socialism has been poorly implemented, but that socialism has been faithfully implemented.  (Applause.)  From the Soviet Union to Cuba to Venezuela, wherever true socialism or communism has been adopted, it has delivered anguish and devastation and failure.  Those who preach the tenets of these discredited ideologies only contribute to the continued suffering of the people who live under these cruel systems.

America stands with every person living under a brutal regime.  Our respect for sovereignty is also a call for action.  All people deserve a government that cares for their safety, their interests, and their wellbeing, including their prosperity.

In America, we seek stronger ties of business and trade with all nations of good will, but this trade must be fair and it must be reciprocal.

For too long, the American people were told that mammoth multinational trade deals, unaccountable international tribunals, and powerful global bureaucracies were the best way to promote their success.  But as those promises flowed, millions of jobs vanished and thousands of factories disappeared.  Others gamed the system and broke the rules.  And our great middle class, once the bedrock of American prosperity, was forgotten and left behind, but they are forgotten no more and they will never be forgotten again.

While America will pursue cooperation and commerce with other nations, we are renewing our commitment to the first duty of every government:  the duty of our citizens.  This bond is the source of America’s strength and that of every responsible nation represented here today.

If this organization is to have any hope of successfully confronting the challenges before us, it will depend, as President Truman said some 70 years ago, on the “independent strength of its members.”  If we are to embrace the opportunities of the future and overcome the present dangers together, there can be no substitute for strong, sovereign, and independent nations — nations that are rooted in their histories and invested in their destinies; nations that seek allies to befriend, not enemies to conquer; and most important of all, nations that are home to patriots, to men and women who are willing to sacrifice for their countries, their fellow citizens, and for all that is best in the human spirit.

In remembering the great victory that led to this body’s founding, we must never forget that those heroes who fought against evil also fought for the nations that they loved.

Patriotism led the Poles to die to save Poland, the French to fight for a free France, and the Brits to stand strong for Britain.

Today, if we do not invest ourselves, our hearts, and our minds in our nations, if we will not build strong families, safe communities, and healthy societies for ourselves, no one can do it for us.

We cannot wait for someone else, for faraway countries or far-off bureaucrats — we can’t do it.  We must solve our problems, to build our prosperity, to secure our futures, or we will be vulnerable to decay, domination, and defeat.

The true question for the United Nations today, for people all over the world who hope for better lives for themselves and their children, is a basic one:  Are we still patriots?  Do we love our nations enough to protect their sovereignty and to take ownership of their futures?  Do we revere them enough to defend their interests, preserve their cultures, and ensure a peaceful world for their citizens?

One of the greatest American patriots, John Adams, wrote that the American Revolution was “effected before the war commenced.  The Revolution was in the minds and hearts of the people.”

That was the moment when America awoke, when we looked around and understood that we were a nation.  We realized who we were, what we valued, and what we would give our lives to defend.  From its very first moments, the American story is the story of what is possible when people take ownership of their future.

The United States of America has been among the greatest forces for good in the history of the world, and the greatest defenders of sovereignty, security, and prosperity for all.

Now we are calling for a great reawakening of nations, for the revival of their spirits, their pride, their people, and their patriotism.

History is asking us whether we are up to the task.  Our answer will be a renewal of will, a rediscovery of resolve, and a rebirth of devotion.  We need to defeat the enemies of humanity and unlock the potential of life itself.

Our hope is a word and — world of proud, independent nations that embrace their duties, seek friendship, respect others, and make common cause in the greatest shared interest of all:  a future of dignity and peace for the people of this wonderful Earth.

This is the true vision of the United Nations, the ancient wish of every people, and the deepest yearning that lives inside every sacred soul.

So let this be our mission, and let this be our message to the world:  We will fight together, sacrifice together, and stand together for peace, for freedom, for justice, for family, for humanity, and for the almighty God who made us all.

Thank you.  God bless you.  God bless the nations of the world.  And God bless the United States of America.  Thank you very much.

Russia,06-03-2008 00:00,Dmitry Medvedev,Opening Remarks at the Meeting on Improving Environmental and Energy Efficiency in the Russian Economy,"Dear Colleagues!

Today we shall continue our discussion of environmental issues. You will recall that a while ago, in January 2008, there was a meeting of the Security Council. We set ourselves a whole range of tasks. Let's talk about what has been done since then and more generally about our future plans.

The first meeting was in Chelyabinsk [with representatives of the Chelyabinsk region environmental activists]. We talked about problems in the area of environmental development, challenges in improving the quality of life of our citizens and their current state of health. At the same time, we touched on another issue related to the impact of environmental standards on the innovative development of our country, in other words, on the level of our competitiveness.

This work is now under way, and part of the run-up to several major international events. I am referring to the upcoming meeting of the eight major states, the G8. I am also thinking about our future plans and the implementation of current obligations, including international obligations.

Unfortunately for our country the problem is very serious. According to the data currently available, 40 million of our citizens live in substandard environmental conditions. Of these, 1 million are forced to live in areas with dangerous levels of pollution.

Naturally, this situation does not encourage the introduction of environmental and resource-saving technologies, and therefore outdated technologies are still in place, which is a sign of backwardness and waste, things that unfortunately we found everywhere. And in the final analysis, as I have already said, this affects our international competitiveness.

Just think about it for a minute: our country ranks first in the world in terms of loss of heating energy. This is a deplorable record. As for the level of energy efficiency, the majority of our industries are between 10 and 20 times less efficient than modern industry should be. That is why we set ourselves the goal of effectively reducing our economy’s energy consumption by almost half.

What needs to be done? We have already discussed this, so let me lay out the essential steps.

First, we need to prepare a fully-fledged system of standards for allowable impact on the environment. Such a bill is now being prepared, and I expect that by 1 October 2009 it will be introduced in the State Duma.

Secondly, we must prepare a differentiated system of standards for the quality of water, air and soil for each territory, differentiated according to current conditions in particular regions of Russia.

Thirdly, we must promote environmentally sound technologies in a variety of ways. We have discussed this before and will talk about it again today. Part of the discussions in Chelyabinsk involved provisions whereby a small business could declare compliance with environmental requirements, rather than go through the excessive and burdensome process of verification. It is simply impossible for small businesses to cope because this process is accompanied by substantial money extractions.

Finally, we need to change the requirements for energy efficiency technologies, buildings, structures and production generally. And for that we need to develop a system of technical regulation (a subject that is, unfortunately, a difficult one for us). We have outlined the general directions in which we want to move, but we must proceed more quickly.

I have to say at least a word about the need to review the system of environmental responsibility. In this regard we have to think about how to do this properly. In some cases we can strengthen the rules; in others, if we believe that liability rules have become detached from reality, we can fix them. As everyone knows, the most important thing about judicial responsibilities is their unavoidability.

One final note: in the 2009 federal budget and that for 2010 – 2011, for the next few years, we need to provide funding for projects involving the use of renewable energy and the introduction of environmentally-friendly and energy efficient technologies. This is what we should allocate for our future.

I suggest that we move on to our discussions.",President,Dmitry Medvedev,http://en.kremlin.ru/events/president/transcripts/statements/303,,DEVELOPMENT
USA,28-06-2021 00:00,Joe Biden,Remarks by President Biden in a Virtual Fundraising Reception for the Democratic National Committee,"THE PRESIDENT:  Reid, thank you.  Thank you, thank you, thank you for hosting this event and for your generous support.  I might note that — I was saying to you when I got to speak to you a few minutes earlier that, you know, you haven’t even — we haven’t even sat down with each other.  You know, anybody who contributed and raised as much funds as you did, everybody expects to be knocking on my door for — you never asked me for a single thing.  You’ve raised an enormous amount of money, and you said, “The reason why we haven’t gotten together, Mr. President, is because we didn’t want to distract you.  We want you to keep going.”  And I’m like — I really mean it.  I hope everybody understands that about almost all of you on this call.  And I want to thank you for your incredible support.

And, Jaime, I think that Leader Clyburn was correct: You’re the right choice for this job.  You’ve been doing outstanding leadership.  And let me just say that you’re part of something special.  We’re bound together in one of the most consequential campaigns in the history of this country.  It really was a battle for the soul of America.

And I just got back, by the way, from Europe after being there for, I guess, 13 days.  I don’t — I forget how many days.  And I met for five days with the G7 nations.  I also — and then there were four others that were there — India, Australia.  And I won’t go through all the detail; it’d be too boring for you.  And then I went to a NATO meeting with all the — all the NATO representatives there and the heads of state.  And then I went to meet with Putin.  Actually, in between, I did the EU.

And here’s the bottom line: I — I think — I know you all understood it: the incredible damage done to us, internationally, by the last outfit that sat in this seat.  And I have to say, sitting here tonight, I’ve lived through what we’ve lived through.  We know just how important it was.  It turns out it was even more important than I thought it was.

Think about the last 150 days: The American Rescue Plan delivered shots in the arms.  And, by the way, we are in a position where we’re getting close to making sure that 70 percent of all the people in America will have been fully vaccinated, or at least get one shot by the — by Independence Day.  We’re way ahead.  No one thought we could ever do that.

And I’m in the process of being able to announce very shortly that we’re going to generate — half a billion doses we’re going to give away between — after taking care of every single American.  Half a billion doses give away to the poorest countries in the world.  And that’s what you do when you want to really help and influence people around the world.

And we put — and — but beyond that, they — you know, the act put shots in arms and checks in pockets for hundreds of millions of Americans who are on the edge.  It’s keeping food on the table, a roof over their heads.  And maybe the thing I’m proudest of is it’s putting us back on track to cut child poverty in half. 

A hundred and fifty million Americans are fully vaccinated now.  The fastest job growth in the first four months, I’m told — not because of me, but because of all of you — of any previous presidency.  Projected economic growth at nearly 7 percent — the highest in four decades.

And just last week, I announced a bipartisan agreement in the Senate asking to make one of the biggest investments ever in infrastructure, ever — rebuilding our roads and bridges; delivering high-speed Internet to every American family, rural and as well as in urban areas; delivering every clean water, getting rid of those lead pipes to every American; building a more resilient power grid; installing electric vehicle charging stations — over half a million of them.  This is the largest investment in public transit ever and the largest investment in rail since the creation of Amtrak 50 years ago.  It’s about creating millions of good-paying jobs, and it’s about our economic competitiveness.

You all know better than I, because you’re all successful people, that we’re in a race in the 21st century to — who’s going to have a strongest economy in the 21st century.  And the rest of the world is not waiting around.  We have more to do, and we have to move fast and move quickly.

This is a — and this agreement, this infrastructure bill that — you know, it signals in the world that we can function, we can deliver.  We can do significant things and show that America is back.  That’s the message I delivered and received during the trip in Europe.  I announced that America is going to help vaccinate the world, because that’s who we are.  That’s what we can do.

I also rallied our European allies to holding China to the same rules of the road in a global economy in the 21st century. 

I made clear to President Putin and Russia that the relationship between America and Russia should be stable and predictable.  We should be able to cooperate where we have our interests, on nuclear non-proliferation and climate change.  And where we have differences, I made it clear to President Putin that I understand why — we have to understand what exists, and whether it’s on cyberattacks or interference in our economy [elections], I will respond.  I will respond.  And I know we’ll respond to specific kinds of actions that harm U.S. interests.

The bottom line of all this at home and abroad: We’re proving that our democracy can deliver for the people when autocrats are betting we can’t. 

But we’ve got a lot more to do.  As we invest in our physical infrastructure, we also have to invest in our human infrastructure, the so-called Biden Family Plan bill.  We’re going to move on the American Family Plan that will deliver childcare, paid leave, universal pre-K, two years of community college, and so much more.

And I will take the case to the American people on the need to protect the sacred right to vote.  It’s under assault in ways that I haven’t seen in my entire career, and that’s what got me involved in the first place.  It’s about who gets to vote and whether the vote counts.  And we have a system that does both with integrity and independence.  But the Republicans want to do what no political party has ever tried to do: get to decide if your vote counts.  It’s outrageous.  We’re going to fight like hell to make sure that doesn’t happen. 

There’s so much to say on all of these subjects.  I’m sorry (inaudible) such shorthand. 

But to work — the work has not been easy, and I’m going to need all of you to help do that work.  The DNC is going to need you, because here’s the deal: We won in 2020 as a unified party, and we need to stay unified and keep doing the big consequential things.

If we make the right decisions in the next four — (inaudible) years, in 50 years, people will look back and say this was the moment that America won the future.  But we can’t do it without you.  And it’s not hyperbole to suggest what I said — that America won the future.

So, look, there’s so much more to say, but the bottom line is that there’s so much at stake.  But I promise you — I promise you, I’ve heard from almost every major world leader — I’ve heard from every major world leader: We can do this.  So we can, in the process, be helping the rest of the world by doing well for ourselves.

May God bless America, and may God protect our troops.  And I look forward to meeting you all in a virtual photo line, which I guess is going to begin very shortly.",President,Joe Biden,https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/speeches-remarks/2021/06/29/remarks-by-president-biden-in-a-virtual-fundraising-reception-for-the-democratic-national-party/,,DEVELOPMENT
China,22-02-2021 00:00,H.E. Wang Yi,Righting the Wrongs and Committing to Mutual Respect and Win-win Cooperation,"Distinguished Guests,
Friends,

Good morning and good evening. During the Chinese Spring Festival season, visionary people from China and the United States are gathering at Lanting to discuss the future of China-U.S. relations. This is indeed very important. Let me begin by extending, on behalf of the Foreign Ministry, our New Year greetings to all the friends who have been caring for and supporting China-U.S. relations over the years.

As we bid farewell to winter and usher in spring, the change of seasons shows that the chills of winter will eventually melt away and the hopes of spring are just around the corner. Humanity must not lose confidence facing the unprecedented common challenges of the global pandemic, economic recession and climate change. We must stand up to them with courage, solidarity and responsibility. As two major countries, China and the United States should first take care of their own stuff and at the same time, they should also work together for the common good of humankind. This is the expectation of the international community and the due responsibility of major countries. On the Lunar New Year's eve, President Xi Jinping and President Joe Biden had their first telephone call. President Xi underscored China's principled position that it is willing to work with the Unites States, in the spirit of no conflict, no confrontation, mutual respect and win-win cooperation, to focus on cooperation, manage differences, and promote sound and steady development of China-U.S. relations. The two Presidents had in-depth exchange of views at length, and agreed that the two countries should enhance mutual understanding and avoid misperception and miscalculation; they should treat each other with candor and sincerity and not seek conflict or confrontation; and they should unclog communication channels and facilitate exchange and cooperation. This very important phone call has oriented China-U.S. relations that had been struggling to ascertain its bearings at a crossroads. It has also sent out the first encouraging news of this spring for the two countries and the whole world.

Friends,

In the past few years, China-U.S. relations deviated from the normal track, and ran into the biggest difficulties since the establishment of diplomatic ties. The root cause was that the previous U.S. administration, out of its own political needs, seriously distorted China's future path and policy, and on that basis, took various measures to suppress and contain China, which inflicted immeasurable damage to bilateral relations. Today, to right the wrongs and bring the relationship back to the right track, the walls of misperceptions must be torn down first to clear the way for knowing, observing, and understanding China as it is.

China is a country that always upholds and promotes people's democracy. Over a long time, Western countries have either seriously distorted or misunderstood China on democracy. In fact, democracy is not a patent of a few countries. It is a common value of humanity. There are various ways to realize democracy, and there is no fixed model or standard answer. True democracy must be rooted in the realities of a country and serve its people. The socialist democracy practiced by China upholds the organic unity of the leadership of the Communist Party of China (CPC), the running of the country by the people, and law-based governance. It is a whole-process democracy. Important legislation and policy-making must go through set procedures and extensive discussions, and the final decision must be made on the basis of scientific and democratic deliberations. It is the most representative democracy where people's matters are widely consulted for the greatest common denominator that suits the will of the whole society. For example, when drafting the 14th Five-year Plan, the Chinese government placed importance on the views from various sectors, and collected over one million comments and recommendations from online channels alone. Facts have shown that China's socialist democracy embodies the will of the people and fits the country's realities. It is thus endorsed by the people, and has made special, important contributions to the progress of political civilization of humankind.

China is a country that is always committed to protecting and promoting human rights. As the largest developing country, China takes a people-centered approach to human rights. We believe that the rights to subsistence and development are basic human rights of paramount importance. At the same time, we strive for comprehensive and coordinated development of economic, social and cultural rights as well as civil and political rights. Over the past 70 plus years since the founding of the People's Republic, China's per capita GDP has risen from less than U.S.$30 to over U.S.$10,000. More than 800 million people have been lifted out of poverty. We have eliminated abject poverty for the first time in China's thousands years of history. Places inhabited by ethnic minorities, such as Xinjiang and Tibet, have stood out as shining examples of China's human rights progress.

In the past 60 years and more, Xinjiang's GDP expanded by over 200 times, with per capita GDP growing by nearly 40 times. And its average life expectancy increased from 30 to 72. In fighting COVID-19, we have made the utmost efforts to protect the right to life and health for each and every Chinese, and at all cost, we have curbed the spread of the virus in the fastest possible speed, and have done our best to raise the cure rate and lower the fatality rate. This has made it possible for the society and the economy to recover quickly.

China is a country that always values and safeguards world peace. China has benefited from world peace in its development, and has contributed to world peace in turn with its development. In the past 70 years and more, we didn't provoke any war or occupy one inch of foreign territory. We seek to settle differences through dialogue and resolve disputes through negotiation. We have no intention to export ideology. Nor do we attempt to overturn the government of any country. We always stay on the new path of state-to-state relations to seek dialogue instead of confrontation and teaming up instead of ganging up. We actively participate in the good offices on hotspot issues. China is the second largest contributor to the UN's regular budget and peacekeeping assessment. It is also the largest contributor of peacekeepers among the five permanent members of the UN Security Council.

China is a country that always advocates and pursues win-win cooperation. We take win-win cooperation as an important principle in our diplomacy. We believe in shared interests and common good. We help fellow developing countries with sincerity and good faith, and we do not attach political strings or impose our wills. In the past seven years since we launched the Belt and Road Initiative, China's trade in goods with partner countries surpassed U.S.$7.8 trillion, and direct investment in those countries topped U.S.$110 billion. All this has been helpful for local employment and economic growth. Despite the global economic recession, China has hosted international import expos for three years to share with other countries the Chinese market opportunities. At the moment, China is following the new development vision, fostering a new development paradigm featuring ""dual circulations"", with domestic circulation as the mainstay and domestic and international circulations reinforcing each other, and advancing opening-up at a higher level. This means a bigger market and more development opportunities for other countries.

China is a country that always practices and upholds multilateralism. China firmly believes in multilateralism. This year marks the 50th anniversary of the restoration of China's lawful seat at the United Nations. During these five decades, China has upheld the purposes and principles of the UN Charter, supported the UN in exercising its authority and playing its due role. We believe that all countries are equal, regardless of their size. And we firmly promote greater democracy in international relations. We never seek to form small circles targeted at other countries. We never take actions unilaterally outside the authorization by the UN. When unilateralism and protectionism ran amok in the last few years, China immediately stepped forward to resist the tendency, and took concrete actions to uphold the basic norms of international relations and safeguard the common interests of developing countries. As UN Secretary-General António Guterres put it, China has become a backbone of multilateralism and an indispensable and trustworthy force for world peace and development.

China now is in an epoch-making year. We will celebrate the centenary of the CPC. The American people have come to know about the CPC for at least 85 years since Edgar Snow visited Yan'an in 1936. From the revolution years to reform and opening-up, from completing the building of a moderately prosperous society to fully building a modern socialist country, the CPC is always committed to the eternal great cause of the Chinese nation. It is showing even stronger vigor and vitality at its 100th anniversary.

We know that the new U.S. administration is reviewing and assessing its foreign policy. We hope that U.S policy makers will keep pace with the time, see clearly the trend of the world, abandon biases, give up unwarranted suspicions, and move to bring the China policy back to reason to ensure a healthy and steady development of China-U.S. relations.

Friends,

How to bring China-U.S. relations back to the right track?

Fifty years ago, Dr. Henry Kissinger made the ice-breaking visit to China, and with extraordinary political resolve, leaders of China and the United States jointly reopened the door of interaction which had been closed for decades. Fifty years later today, we must, with the sense of responsibility for the two countries and the world, make once again the sensible and right decision. Here are some key points of China's position.

First, it is important to respect each other and not to interfere in each other's internal affairs. This is a basic norm governing international relations. A good-mannered gentleman never thrusts his knife and fork into the food on someone else's plate. Similarly, ""Do unto others as you would have them do unto you"", a teaching by Confucius, is widely accepted around the world. For major countries like China and the United States, there is a greater need to respect each other, rather than being fixated on remodeling, suppressing or even defeating the other. Such attempts have not succeeded, and never will. They will only cause problems and even conflicts unnecessarily.

Since the establishment of diplomatic ties, China has all along respected the choices made by the American people, welcomed the strong growth momentum of the United States, and never interfered in its internal affairs. We have no intention to challenge or replace the United States. We are ready to have peaceful coexistence and seek common development with the United States. Likewise, we hope the United States will respect China's core interests, national dignity, and rights to development. We urge the United States to stop smearing the CPC and China's political system, stop conniving at or even supporting the erroneous words and actions of separatist forces for ""Taiwan independence"", and stop undermining China's sovereignty and security on internal affairs concerning Hong Kong, Xinjiang and Tibet. Only with true mutual respect can China-U.S. relations achieve steady improvement and growth in the long run.

Second, it is important to step up dialogue and properly manage the differences. Given the differences between our two countries in social system, development stage, history and culture, it is natural for us to have disagreements. What is crucial is to enhance mutual understanding through dialogue and not allow our relations to be defined by disagreements. Over the past few years, the United States basically cut off bilateral dialogue at all levels. And this was one of the main reasons for the deterioration of China-U.S. relations.

At present, both sides should follow up on the phone call between the two Presidents on the eve of the Chinese New Year, act in the fundamental interests of the two peoples, take a forward-looking, open-minded and inclusive attitude, and reactivate or establish dialogue mechanisms in various areas and at various levels. The two sides should engage in candid dialogues on a broad range of issues in bilateral relations and on major regional and international issues, so as to get a clear understanding of each other's policy intentions, sort out the critical issues in China-U.S. relations, and explore effective ways to manage sensitive issues, ward off risks and remove obstacles. China is, as always, open to dialogue. We stand ready to have candid communication with the U.S. side, and engage in dialogues aimed at solving problems.

Third, it is important to move in the same direction to restart mutually beneficial cooperation. Both countries gain from cooperation and lose from confrontation. This has been proved time and again by history and by practices since the diplomatic relationship was established. With regional hotspot issues and global challenges emerging one after another, areas for China-U.S. cooperation are expanding rather than shrinking, and the prospects for interaction are broadening rather than narrowing. More than ever China and the United States are more capable of getting big things done to the benefit of the two countries and the world at large.

Under the current circumstances, the two sides may start from easier things, interact actively, and build up goodwill. Economic cooperation and trade is an important part of China-U.S. relations. Despite COVID-19, two-way trade expanded last year against headwinds, reflecting the win-win nature and intrinsic vitality of bilateral trade ties. China welcomes greater success of U.S. businesses in China, and will continue to take effective measures to improve our business environment. At the same time, we hope that the U.S. side will adjust its policies as soon as possible, among others, remove unreasonable tariffs on Chinese goods, lift its unilateral sanctions on Chinese companies and research and educational institutes, and abandon irrational suppression of China's technological progress, so as to create necessary conditions for China-U.S. cooperation. COVID-19, climate change and world economic recovery are the three most pressing tasks for the international community. As a major responsible country, China is ready to coordinate policies and work with the United States in these three areas for the good of the whole world.

Fourth, it is important to clear the path for the resumption of bilateral exchanges in all areas. Over the past 40-odd years of diplomatic relations, various sectors of the two countries have forged deep bonds. There are 50 pairs of sister provinces/states and 232 pairs of sister cities. China had been the biggest source of international students in the United States for ten years in a row. However, these normal exchanges were seriously disrupted in the past few years. The number of Chinese visitors to the United States, either for exchange programs or study, had plummeted. The social foundation of bilateral relations was ""poisoned"", which should not be allowed to happen in the first place.

People-to-people friendship holds the key to state-to-state relations. The Chinese and American peoples enjoy a long-standing friendship, which should stay immune to the ups and downs in the political dimension of the relations. The late Professor Ezra Vogel, a prominent China scholar, called for a rational China policy till the last days of his life. He co-authored the open letter, entitled ""China is not an enemy"", and it was co-signed by many well-known people. We hope that the U.S. side will act as early as possible to lift its restrictions on Chinese educational and cultural groups, media outlets and institutions for overseas Chinese affairs in the United States, remove its obstructions for U.S. subnational governments and social sectors to engage with China, and encourage and support the resumption of normal exchange programs between universities, research institutes and of students. China is ready to work with the United States with an open mind to build a good environment for people-to-people exchanges.

Friends,

In the final analysis, the future of China-U.S. relationship is in the hands of the two peoples. Its improvement always requires support of the two societies. I sincerely hope that today's Lanting Forum will be a platform for candid discussions and consensus building as well as a source of vision, insight and wisdom for a better China-U.S. relationship. I hope that the two sides will work together to steer the giant ship of China-U.S. relations back to the course of sound development toward a bright future with boundless prospects.

China,27-09-2019 00:00,H.E. Wang Yi,China Today: A Proud Member of the Global Community,"Mr. President,

This year marks the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People’s Republic of China. In 1945, the United Nations was born in response to the call of the times. Four years later, the People’s Republic of China was founded, and the Chinese nation reemerged before the eyes of the world as a completely reborn nation.

In the past 70 years, we Chinese have changed our destiny through tireless efforts. Seventy years ago, China put an end to a period in modern history in which the country was torn apart and trampled upon. We stood up and became true masters of our country. Over the past seven decades, China has turned itself from a closed, backward and poor country with a weak foundation into a country that is open and on the move. On the basis of meeting the basic needs of its people, China has achieved initial prosperity. 850 million Chinese have shaken off poverty, and hundreds of millions have joined the middle income group. Such achievements are nothing but a miracle in the development of mankind. In just several decades, China has finished what took developed countries several hundred years to complete. In so doing, China has blazed a new path to modernization for developing countries, and what China has achieved has enriched the dreams of people around the world for a better life.

None of these achievements has fallen from the sky. Rather, they owe themselves to the hard work, vision and courage of the Chinese people. The secret behind China’s development is our adherence to the centralized, unified leadership of the Communist Party of China, to the development path suited to China’s national conditions, to the fundamental state policy of reform and opening up, and to a people-centered development philosophy.

In the past 70 years, China has integrated itself into the global community and made its contribution to the world. China has actively boosted world peace and prosperity through its development. Today, China has become the leading engine of global development and an anchor of stability for world peace. China is the second largest funding contributor to both the United Nations and UN peacekeeping operations. China has also dispatched the largest number of peacekeeping personnel among the permanent members of the UN Security Council. For more than a decade, China has been a prime engine powering global growth. China is now pursuing a new round of opening up with higher standard, which I am sure will deliver new opportunities to the world.

As we enter a new era, we Chinese are more confident and capable than ever before to achieve the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation, and we are in a better position than ever before to make greater contribution to humankind. Guided by Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics in the New Era, we will continue to strive on and forge ahead. Looking back at the road we have traversed over the past 70 years, we are full of pride. Looking ahead at the journey before us, we are full of confidence about our bright future!

Mr. President,

On the diplomatic front, China has traveled a journey of tests and challenges and has remained true to our original purpose. The goal of China’s diplomacy has never changed. The Chinese people and the peoples of other countries have always treated each other with sincerity and rendered each other mutual support. Increasingly, China and other countries have become stakeholders sharing a common future. Facing international uncertainties, China will maintain the stability and continuity of its foreign policy, and will continue to pursue the major country diplomacy with distinct Chinese features. China will continue to safeguard world peace and prosperity and promote development and advancement of humankind.

China is guided by the principle of independence. China will continue to uphold an independent foreign policy of peace. We will neither subordinate ourselves to others, nor coerce others into submission. We are firm in upholding China’s core national interests and legitimate rights and interests; we are against the abuse of power and will never yield to pressure. China will remain committed to the basic principles of sovereign equality and non-interference in other country’s internal affairs as enshrined in the UN Charter. China will never pursue hegemony or seek expansion. Peaceful development, which has long been incorporated in China’s Constitution, is the cornerstone of China’s foreign policy.

China believes in equality among nations. In the 21st century, power politics and the law of the jungle are outdated and obsolete. People want mutual respect and harmonious coexistence. China stands for equality among all countries irrespective of their size. China respects the sovereignty and territorial integrity of other countries, and the social system and development path independently chosen by the people of these countries. China stands ready to share its development experience with other countries and provide necessary assistance in time of need. Yet, we have no intention to export our development model or to lecture others. Nor do we attach any political strings to our assistance.

China stands for equity and justice. On the international stage, we speak for justice and oppose hegemonism or bullying. We wish to engage others in extensive consultation and joint contribution in pursuit of shared benefits. We call for the handling of international affairs based on the merits of each particular case and for the settlement of issues through consultation. As the largest developing country, China will always stand firmly with other developing countries to safeguard the common interests and right to development of developing countries and increase the representation and say of developing countries in global governance so as to promote democracy in international relations.

China pursues mutually beneficial cooperation. In this globalized world, countries all rise or fall together. A zero-sum mentality and beggar-thy-neighbor policy are recipes for failure. China is committed to fostering an open world economy and upholding the WTO-centered multilateral trading regime. It is committed to making globalization more open, inclusive, balanced and beneficial to all. We do not seek unilateral security, nor do we put our own interests above the interests of others. It is our aim to advance our development as part of the development of the global community. We seek to expand shared interests with our door open and share opportunities with others through cooperation.

Mr. President,

The world today is not a peaceful place. Unilateralism and protectionism are posing major threats to the international order. At a time when the future of the world is at stake, China has never been and will never be an onlooker. As a founding member of the United Nations, we will work with other countries to build a new type of international relations and a community with a shared future for mankind. We will be resolute in upholding the stature and role of the United Nations, the international system underpinned by the UN, and the international order anchored upon international law.

Facing the headwinds of protectionism, we should not just stand idly by.

Erecting walls will not resolve global challenges, and blaming others for one’s own problems does not work. The lessons of the Great Depression should not be forgotten. Tariffs and provocation of trade disputes, which upset global industrial and supply chains, serve to undermine the multilateral trading regime and global economic and trade order. They may even plunge the world into recession. Regarding economic and trade frictions and differences, China is committed to resolve them in a calm, rational and cooperative manner, and is willing to demonstrate utmost patience and goodwill. Should the other side act in bad faith, or show no respect for equal status or rules in negotiations, we will have to make necessary responses to safeguard our legitimate rights and interests, and to uphold international justice. Let me make it very clear: China is a country with a 5,000-year civilization, 1.4 billion hardworking and courageous people, and a vast land of 9.6 million square kilometers. China will not ever be cowered by threats, or subdued by pressure.

Facing rampant unilateralism, we should not just sit idly by.

The international order needs to go by laws and rules, and acts in violation of international norms can only plunge the world into chaos. Opportunities arising from the new round of scientific and technological revolution are opportunities of the world. Advances thus made should not be monopolized by any single country, and no one should obstruct the efforts of other countries to make innovations. It is not legitimate or justifiable for any country standing from a position of power to impose unilateral sanctions or exercise long-arm jurisdiction over other countries, as such practice has no basis in international law. To put one’s own interests above the common interests of all other countries is a typical bullying practice that finds no support of the people.

The Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces (INF) Treaty is important in upholding global strategic balance and stability. Unilateral withdrawal from it will cause multiple negative impact. China is opposed to the deployment of land-based intermediate-range missiles in the Asia Pacific. We urge the countries with the largest nuclear arsenals to fully fulfill their special and primary responsibilities in nuclear disarmament. China will continue to take an active part in the international arms control process. Here, I announce that China has initiated the domestic legal procedures to join the Arms Trade Treaty.

Permanent members of the Security Council need to lead by example, as major countries shoulder special responsibilities for maintaining a stable international order. China supports the new round of efforts by Secretary-General Guterres to reform the UN system and make it more efficient and equitable. China has set up an 8,000-strong peacekeeping standby force and permanent peacekeeping police squads. They have met standards for operation and are ready for action. China stands ready to work with other parties to fulfill our due responsibilities as a major country for upholding global peace and justice.

Mr. President,

In a world fraught with challenges and mounting risks, China will remain on the side of peace and justice. We will actively explore and apply a Chinese approach to addressing hotspot issues, and play a constructive role in upholding international peace and security. China stands for common, comprehensive, cooperative and sustainable security. We hold that disputes should be settled through dialogue and consultation and that common threats should be addressed through international cooperation in the interest of sustaining global peace and common security.

The Iranian nuclear issue affects world peace and security. All parties need to work together to uphold the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) and ensure that this historic outcome is not derailed. Given the growing tensions in the Middle East and the Gulf region, China proposes the following: the Iranian nuclear issue should be speedily brought back to the track of the JCPOA; the Gulf countries should be urged to establish a platform for dialogue and consultation; and countries from outside the region should play a positive role in maintaining security in the region.

The Palestinian issue must be put at the top of the international agenda. What we lack is not a grand design, but the courage to deliver on the commitments and the conscience to uphold justice. There should be no more regression from the two-state solution and the “land for peace” principle, which represent a bottom line of international justice. For the Palestinian people, to establish an independent state is their inalienable right, something that should not be used as a bargaining chip.

On Afghanistan, what we hope to see is a united Afghanistan where all political parties and ethnic groups together determine the future of their nation, a stable Afghanistan that resolutely combats terrorism, and an Afghanistan that lives in harmony with its neighbors and becomes a positive force for maintaining peace and stability in the region. We will continue to contribute our share to Afghanistan’s reconciliation and reconstruction.

Regarding the Korean Peninsula, the opportunity for the political settlement of the issue must not be missed again. The zigzag course over the past 20 years or so shows time and again that the realistic and viable way forward is to promote parallel progress in denuclearization and the establishment of a peace mechanism and to accommodate the concerns of all sides and gradually build trust through phased and synchronized actions. The DPRK has demonstrated a readiness to promote dialogue. It is hoped that the US can meet the DPRK halfway. It is necessary for the Security Council to consider, in light of new developments on the Peninsula, invoking the rollback terms of the DPRK-related resolutions in order to bolster the political settlement of the Peninsula issue.

Myanmar and Bangladesh, with the mediation efforts of China, have reached new common understanding on accelerating the work for the return of displaced persons. The momentum created has not come easily. Waiting without acting brings no solution. It will further deteriorate the humanitarian situation. Only real action will bring hope and create conditions for reaching a final solution toward the Rakhine issue. All the parties involved, including UN agencies, should help move things forward rather than holding back the process.

The Kashmir issue, a dispute left from the past, should be peacefully and properly addressed in accordance with the UN Charter, Security Council resolutions and bilateral agreement. No actions that would unilaterally change the status quo should be taken. As a neighbor of both India and Pakistan, China hopes to see the dispute effectively managed and stability restored to the relationship between the two sides.

Mr. President,

Development is the master key to solving all problems. Development should be placed at the center of the global macro policy framework, with continued focus on priority areas such as poverty reduction, infrastructure, education, and public health. We need to maintain global development cooperation with North-South cooperation as the main channel, supplemented by South-South cooperation. We need to build an open world economy and help developing countries better integrate into the global industrial and value chains.

The UN member states should achieve complementarity between the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and their medium- to long-term development strategies, in an effort to pursue high-quality development. China’s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) aims to achieve development that is open, green and clean as well as high-standard, sustainable and people-centered. The BRI, an initiative highly compatible with the 2030 Agenda, has become a road to cooperation, hope and prosperity, delivering real benefits to people the world over. We hope that other countries will seize the development opportunities created by the BRI to add fresh impetus to the implementation of the 2030 Agenda.

Climate change is a global consensus. We need to respond to this challenge with concerted global efforts according to the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities. The UN Climate Action Summit has achieved positive outcomes; China, as a co-lead of the Nature-Based Solutions, has played its due role to make this possible. China believes in acting in good faith. We will deliver what we have signed up to, fulfill our obligations, and work with real actions to contribute to the building of a clean and beautiful world.

China places high importance on the life and health of its people, and has always taken a zero-tolerance approach to narcotics. We have placed all fentanyl-related substances under control, a move that goes well beyond such scheduling by the UN. This demonstrates that China has actively participated in global narcotics control with a keen sense of responsibility. On to the Ebola outbreak in Africa, as the alarm is sounded once again, China has already sent emergency aid supplies to the Democratic Republic of the Congo and its neighbors affected by the epidemic. China has also sent public health experts and maintained close collaboration with the World Health Organization and the African Union Commission. Besides, China will donate another US$18 million to the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria.

Mr. President,

I wish to conclude with a quote from President Xi Jinping: “Our world is full of both hope and challenges. We should not give up our dreams just because the reality around us is too complicated; we should not stop pursuing our ideals just because they seem out of our reach.” Let us work tirelessly to promote the purposes and principles of the UN Charter and together build a community with a shared future for mankind.

Thank you!",State Councilor and Foreign Minister of the People's Republic of China,Xi Jinping,https://www.fmprc.gov.cn/mfa_eng/wjdt_665385/zyjh_665391/t1703219.shtml,,INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS
China,16-05-2021 00:00,H.E. Wang Yi,"End the Fighting and Violence Immediately and
Uphold Equity and Justice","Mr. Secretary-General,
Colleagues,

I thank Secretary-General António Guterres and Special Coordinator for the Middle East Peace Process Tor Wennesland for their briefings. I listened attentively to the statements by the Palestinian Foreign Minister, the Israeli Permanent Representative to the UN, and Foreign Ministers of Egypt and Jordan. I welcome the representatives of Algeria and the League of Arab States to today's open debate.

The conflict between Israel and Palestine has kept escalating in recent days. It has caused heavy casualties, including women and children. The situation is dangerous and urgent, and it calls for an immediate ceasefire and stop of violence. The international community must take actions right away and make every effort to avert further deterioration of the situation, prevent the region from backsliding into turbulence, and protect lives in local communities.

Colleagues,

The Palestinian question remains at the heart of the Middle East issue. Without stability in the Middle East, there can hardly be tranquility in the world. Only when the Palestinian question is resolved in a comprehensive, just and durable manner can lasting peace and common security be truly realized in the Middle East. In light of the current tensions, China would like to propose the following:

First, a ceasefire and stop of violence is the most pressing task. The use of force cannot bring peace or tranquility, and violence only sows more seeds of hatred. China strongly condemns violence against civilians, and we once again urge the parties of the conflict to immediately cease military actions and hostilities and stop such moves as airstrikes, ground offensives and rocket launches that aggravate the situation. It is important that Israel exercise restraint, earnestly observe the relevant UN resolutions, stop the demolition of Palestinian homes and the eviction of the Palestinian people, discontinue its settlement expansion, put an end to the violence, threats and provocations against Muslims, and maintain and respect the historical status quo of the holy sites in Jerusalem. Meanwhile, Palestine needs to avoid taking steps that may further escalate the situation, avert civilian casualties, and work with other parties for an immediate de-escalation of the situation.

Second, humanitarian assistance is urgently needed. The concurrence of the COVID pandemic and the conflicts and turbulence has made the humanitarian crisis all the more challenging for the region. The situation in the Gaza Strip is particularly worrisome. We urge Israel to earnestly fulfill its obligations under international law, promptly and fully lift blockade on and besiege of Gaza, ensure the safety and rights of the civilians in the occupied Palestinian territory, and facilitate the access of humanitarian assistance. The international community should extend humanitarian aid to Palestine via multiple channels, and continue to support the work of the UN Relief and Works Agency for Palestinian Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA), in an effort to improve the humanitarian situation in Palestine. The United Nations needs to coordinate the planning of the international humanitarian emergency relief, and make utmost efforts to prevent a humanitarian disaster from happening.

Third, international support is a due obligation. The Security Council, shouldering the primary responsibility for safeguarding international peace and security, must take strong actions on the Palestine-Israel conflict, reiterate its firm support for the two-state solution, and do more to cool down the situation as soon as possible. China has been working with the relevant countries to draft a Security Council press statement. Regrettably, however, the Security Council has not been able to speak in one voice till today because of the obstruction by one single country. We call upon the United States to shoulder its due responsibilities, take a just position and, together with the majority of the international community, support the Security Council in easing the situation, rebuilding trust and advancing political settlement. We also support a more active role by the UN, the League of Arab States, the Organization of Islamic Countries and countries with important influence in the region so as to help galvanize more broad-based and effective efforts for peace.

Fourth, the two-state solution is the fundamental way forward. Recent years have seen a derailment of the Middle East peace process. The relevant UN resolutions have not been effectively implemented. In particular, Palestine's right to establish an independent state has been persistently undermined, and the suffering of the Palestinian people further deepened, leading to the crisis we see today. What has happened proves once again that an enduring settlement can only be achieved on the basis of the two-state solution. The Palestine-Israel issue has been on the agenda of the UN for more than 70 years. Generations of Palestinians have waited, year after year, for the restoration of their legitimate national right, which still remains elusive. Justice is already running late, but it must not be forever absent. China supports a resumption of peace talks between Palestine and Israel on the basis of the two-state solution as soon as possible. China supports the early establishment of an independent state of Palestine that enjoys full sovereignty on the basis of the 1967 borders and with east Jerusalem as its capital. This is the way to fundamentally achieve peaceful coexistence between Palestine and Israel, harmony between the Arab and Jewish peoples, and enduring peace in the Middle East.

Colleagues,

China is a sincere friend of the Palestinian people. We have all along followed the Middle East peace process with concern, and remained a staunch force for justice and fairness and for all efforts conducive to de-escalation. The current situation has further highlighted the significance of the four-point proposal on the Palestinian question put forward by President Xi Jinping in 2017. Since assuming the rotating presidency of the Council, China has attached particular importance to the current tensions in the Middle East and has facilitated multiple rounds of deliberations on the Palestinian question. China will double down on our efforts to promote peace talks and earnestly perform our duty as the Council President. We reaffirm our invitation to Palestinian and Israeli peace advocates to continue their dialogue in China, and welcome representatives of the two sides to come to China for direct negotiations.

Every turbulence in Palestine-Israel relations sounds the alarm for international rule of law, tests multilateral cooperation, and weighs on human conscience. Will the United Nations and its Security Council step forward and do what they should? People across the world are watching, and history is keeping account. We should and must stand in solidarity for peace and justice, for equity and conscience, and on the right side of history. We must practice true multilateralism and strive for an early, comprehensive, just and enduring settlement of the Palestinian question.

Thank you.",State Councilor and Foreign Minister of the People's Republic of China,Xi Jinping,https://www.fmprc.gov.cn/mfa_eng/wjdt_665385/zyjh_665391/t1876307.shtml,,INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS

China,28-09-2015 00:00,Xi Jinping,Promoting Women's All-round Development and Building a Better World for All Remarks by H.E. Xi Jinping President of the People's Republic of ChinaAt the Global Leaders' Meeting on Gender Equality And Women's Empowerment,"Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon,
Executive Director Phumzile Mlambo-Ngcuk,
Colleagues,
Ladies and Gentlemen,
Friends,

On the occasion of the 70th anniversary of the founding of the United Nations and the 20th anniversary of the Fourth World Conference on Women in Beijing, it is of great significance for us to convene this Global Leaders' Meeting to reaffirm our commitment to gender equality and women's development and make plans for a better future.

Women are creators of material and spiritual wealth and represent an important force driving social development and progress. Without women, there would be no continuity of the human race or the human society.

The pursuit of gender equality is a great cause. A review of history shows that without women's liberation and progress, the liberation and progress of mankind would not be attainable. To achieve the lofty goal of gender equality, we have gone through an extraordinary and uphill journey. From the publication of the Declaration of the Rights of Woman over 200 years ago to the observance of International Women's Day on 8 March, from the establishment of the Commission on the Status of Women to the adoption of the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women, every step taken to promote women's cause has been a giant step forward for the progress of human civilization.

Twenty years ago, the Fourth World Conference on Women in Beijing adopted the Beijing Declaration and the Platform for Action, laying down strategic goals and policy frameworks for promoting gender equality and ensuring women's rights. Today, the spirit championed by the Beijing Conference has catalyzed positive changes. The consensus among countries on pursuing gender equality is strengthening. More diversified actions have been taken to promote women's development. And the social context for women's life and development is improving. In this regard, UN Women should be fully recognized for the tremendous work it has done.

Thanks to persistent efforts over the years, dreams that were once beyond reach have come true: 143 countries have enshrined gender equality in their laws, thus removing legal barriers to women's participation in political and economic activities; and it has become a public consensus across the world for women to have access to education and freedom of marriage and employment.

In many parts of the world, however, disparities remain in the level of women's development, and inequality still exists between men and women in rights, opportunities and access to resources. People have yet to fully recognize women's potential, talent and contribution. Women account for over half of the 800 million impoverished population of the world. They tend to bear the brunt of wars and epidemics, and suffer deeply from terrorism and violence. As we speak, various forms of discrimination against women are still taking place. Abuses and inhuman treatment of women continue to occur from time to time.

All this shows that we still have a long way to go in achieving gender equality. We must work tirelessly to broaden the prospect for women's cause.

Ladies and Gentlemen,

Friends,

In the Post-2015 Development Agenda we have just adopted, gender perspective has been included in all the items on the agenda. Let us reaffirm the spirit of the Beijing Conference with renewed commitment and pledge greater efforts to promote gender equality and women's all-round development.

First, we should strive for women's development in tandem with social and economic progress. Development cannot be achieved without women, and its benefit must be shared by all people, women included. We need to come up with more well-rounded development strategies that take into account national realities, gender differences and the special needs of women and aim to ensure women's equal share in the fruits of development. Policy measures should be updated to stimulate women's potential and raise their participation in the process of social and economic development. China's experiences show that a higher level of social and economic participation by women helps to raise their status, and it also boosts social productivity and invigorates the economy.

Second, we should protect women's rights and interests. Women's rights and interests are basic human rights. They must be protected by laws and regulations and integrated into national and social rules and norms. We must build up women's capacity of playing their part in the society and economy, involve women in higher levels of decision making and support them in becoming leaders in political, business and academic fields. We must ensure sufficient basic medical services for women, and pay particular attention to the health needs of rural women, women with disabilities, migrant women, middle-aged and senior women and women of ethnic minorities. We must ensure that school is affordable and safe for every girl, and develop vocational and life-long education for women to help them better adapt to changes in society and the job market.

Third, we should make efforts to build harmonious and inclusive societies. Men and women live in the same one world. A society with less discrimination or prejudice against women is often more inclusive and dynamic. We must eradicate all forms of violence against women, including domestic violence. We should focus on gender equality and dismiss outdated mentalities and customs inhibiting women's development. I appreciate Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon's ""He for She"" Initiative, and hope more men will join in the action.

Fourth, we should foster a global environment favorable for women's development. Women and children are the ones who suffer most when peace or tranquility is disrupted. We must stand firmly for peace, development and win-win cooperation, cherish peace dearly and uphold it so that every woman and child will enjoy the sunshine of happiness and tranquility.

Women's organizations in different countries should strengthen interactions with each other to enhance friendship, pursue development and make progress together. We should continue to carry out women-related international development cooperation. Developed countries should scale up financial and technological assistance to developing countries and narrow the development gap among women in different countries.

Ladies and Gentlemen,

Friends,

As the Chinese people pursue a happy life, every Chinese woman has the opportunities to excel in life and make their dream come true. China will do more to enhance gender equality as its basic state policy, give play to women's important role as ""half of the sky"" and support them in realizing their own dreams and aspirations in both career and life. The Chinese women, through their own development, will also play a greater part in global women's movement and make greater contribution to gender equality in the world.

To support women's development worldwide and the work of UN Women, China will donate US$10 million to UN Women for the implementation of the Beijing Declaration and its Platform for Action and the realization of the related goals in the post-2015 development agenda. In the coming five years, China will help other developing countries build 100 ""health projects for women and children"", send teams of medical experts to provide services, and implement 100 ""happy campus projects"" to finance the schooling of poor girls and raise girls' school enrollment rate. We will also host 30,000 women from developing countries for training programs in China and provide 100,000 skills training opportunities in local communities of other developing countries. Under the related fund co-sponsored by China and the UN, there will be special capacity building programs for women from developing countries.

Ladies and Gentlemen,

Friends,

Let us work hand in hand and move faster to build a better world for women and for all of us!

I wish the Global Leaders' Meeting a full success.

Thank you.",President,Xi Jinping,https://www.fmprc.gov.cn/mfa_eng/wjdt_665385/zyjh_665391/t1305408.shtml,,OTHERS
United Kingdom,25-May-11,David Cameron,PM and President Obama’s press conference,"It’s a pleasure to welcome President Obama here today. Over the past year I’ve got to know the President well. And whether it’s in routine situations like sitting around the G8 table or the slightly less routine ones like getting a phone call in the middle of the night, I have come to value not just his leadership and courage, but the fact that to all the big international issues of our time, he brings thoughtful consideration and reason. I know today he will be thinking of the dreadful tornado in Missouri - and all those who have lost lives and loved ones. Our hearts in Britain go out to all those people too. Barack and I know well the shared history of our countries. From the beaches of Normandy to the Imjin river, our soldiers have fought together. From labs in Cambridge, Massachusetts to Cambridge, England, our scientists have decoded DNA and cured diseases together. And in millions of interactions every day - including our massive business relationship - our people forge friendships together. That’s what makes this relationship special. But what makes it essential is that it’s not just about history or sentiment. It is a living, working partnership. It is essential to our security. It is essential for our prosperity. And I feel every day just how important this partnership is. The President and I, together with my Deputy Prime Minister, have just had some excellent discussions. We’ve been talking today about the two things we care about most: Getting our people jobs, and keeping our people safe. Because every night, millions of British and American people take the same worries to bed with them. They’re asking if they can find a good job, if they are going to get a pay cheque next month, if there will be work for their children when they grow up. The stark truth of the world today is that no country is owed a living. We’ve got to pay our way, and we’ve got to earn our way - and that is what the President and I are determined to do. Barack and I did not come into politics to cut public spending but neither did we seek office to see our great economies decline, or to land our children with unsustainable debts. That’s why by the second half of this decade, we’re making sure that debt ratios will be falling on both sides of the Atlantic. At the same time, we’re investing in our roads and railways, in science, innovation, above all in our young people. And down the line, the success of all this won’t be measured in export figures and trade flows, it will be in the feelings of the factory-worker in Phoenix, or the shop-keeper in Liverpool, or the engineer in Ohio… …the people who know that if they work hard, then prosperity will be there for them - and the promise of a better life there for their children. As well as the economy, the President and I had some good discussions on security. Americans and Brits do not need to explain terrorism to one another. Both our people have suffered at its hands; indeed, they have died together. My wife Samantha was in Manhattan on 9/11. I’ll never forget trying to contact her for five long hours and she’ll never forget the New Yorkers she met that day. And today, as we come up to the tenth anniversary, we remember the spirit of that city and the sympathy we feel with those who lost their loved ones, including so many British families. Now, there are those that say this terrorist threat is beyond our control. We passionately believe that is wrong. We can defeat al Qaeda and the events of recent months give us an opportunity to turn the tide on their terror once and for all. I believe there are three actions we must take. First, we must continue to destroy the terrorist networks. And I congratulate the President on the operation against Bin Laden. This was not just a victory for justice but a strike right in the heart of international terrorism. In this vital effort, we must continue to work with Pakistan. People are asking questions about our relationship, so we need to be clear: Pakistan has suffered more from terrorism than any other country in the world. Their enemy is our enemy. So far from walking away, we’ve got to work even more closely with them. At the same time, this is a vital year in Afghanistan. British and American forces are fighting side by side in Helmand, right at the heart of this operation. We have broken the momentum of the insurgency and even in the Taliban’s heartland of Kandahar and Central Helmand they are on the back foot. Now is the moment to step up our efforts to reach a political settlement. The Taliban must make a decisive split from Al Qaeda, give up violence, and join a political process that will bring lasting peace to that country. We are agreed to give this the highest priority in the months ahead. Second, we must reach a conclusion to the Arab-Israeli peace process. Again, I congratulated the President on his recent speech on the Middle East which was bold, visionary - and set out what is needed in the clearest possible terms: An end to the terror against Israelis. The restoration of dignity to the Palestinians. Two states, living side by side, in peace. Yes, the road has been - and will be - long and arduous. But the prize is clear. Conclude the peace process and you don’t just bring security to the region. You deny extremists of one of their most profound, and enduring, recruiting sergeants, weakening their calling and crippling their cause. That’s why whatever the difficulties, we must continue to press for a solution. Our third action must be to help elevate the changes in North Africa and the Arab world - from a moment in history to a turning-point in history. We’ve seen some extraordinary things. Protestors braving bullets, bloggers toppling dictators, people taking to the streets and making their own history. If global politics is about spreading peace and prosperity, then this is a once-in-a-generation moment to grab hold of. It’s not a time for us to shrink back and think about our own issues and interests. This is our issue - and this is massively in our interests. Those people in Tahrir Square and Tripoli just want what we have - a job and a voice. And we all share in their success or failure. If they succeed, there is new hope for those living there and the hope of a better and safer world for all of us. But if they fail, if that hunger is denied, then some young people in that region will continue to listen to the poisonous narrative of extremism. So the President and I are agreed: we will stand with those who work for freedom. This is the message we will take to the G8 tomorrow, when we push for a major programme of economic and political support for those countries seeking to reform. This is why we mobilised the international community to protect the Libyan people from Colonel Qadhafi’s regime, why we will continue to enforce the UN resolutions with our allies, and why we re-state our position once more: it is impossible to imagine a future for Libya with Qadhafi still in power. He must go. In all of these actions, we must be clear about our ambitions. Barack and I came of age in the 1980s and 90s. We saw the end of the Cold War and the victory over Communism. We saw the invasion of Kuwait by Saddam Hussein and the world coming together to liberate that country. Throughout it all, we saw Presidents and Prime Minister’s standing together for freedom. Today, we feel just as passionately about extending freedom as those who came before us. But we also know that idealism without realism does no good for anyone. We have learned the lessons of history: Democracy is built from the ground up. You’ve got to work with the grain of other cultures and not against them. Real change takes time. It’s because we share this view that this partnership will not just continue, but get stronger. And this is a partnership that goes beyond foreign affairs. At home we have similar goals - to bring more responsibility to our societies and to bring transparency and accountability to our governments. In all these ambitions our countries will continue to learn from each other, and work with each other. As ever it has been a pleasure to talk to the President and it’s an honour to have him with us today.",Prime Minister,David Cameron,https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/pm-and-president-obamas-press-conference,,INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS
United Kingdom,25-Oct-10,David Cameron,"PM's speech on creating a ""new economic dynamism""","Transcript of speech given by the Prime Minister, Mr David Cameron at CBI on Monday 25 October 2010 Read the transcript: There is one question I want to answer today: Where is the growth going to come from - where are the jobs going to come from? Over the course of this Parliament - and the next - I believe we can transform our fortunes. We’re in a world of unprecedented economic change, with millions of new consumers and countless innovations where companies are starting with less investment than ever before, yet still becoming global giants within a matter of years. This is an incredible opportunity for Britain, for new start-ups to flourish, for innovations to drive growth and create jobs. Today, I want to set out what our strategy for growth will mean for Britain. I want to tell you how we can create a new economic dynamism in our country - so we can build real confidence in our future. First let me tell you what I won’t do. I won’t engage in some sterile debate between laissez faire and hands-on government. The question isn’t ‘should government be involved?’ because it is involved. It taxes. It regulates. It invests. The real question is what is the right kind of involvement? I believe one of the most important things government can do is drive trade. Last year the share of UK exports to China and India was just 3.2 per cent. Indeed, the UK exports more to Ireland than to Brazil, Russia, India and China - combined. These are shocking figures. My approach is clear, British business should have no more vocal champion than the British government and that’s why I have put the promotion of British commerce and international trade at the heart of our foreign and economic policy. So when I went to India this summer, I took the biggest visiting delegation of business leaders and entrepreneurs of any Prime Minister in recent memory. At the European Council this week, I’ll be calling for structural reforms of the single market so Europe makes a stronger contribution to world growth And when I go to the G20 summit in two weeks, I’ll be pushing for the completion of Doha, which could add $170 billion to the global economy each year. But the right kind of government involvement stretches beyond banging the drum for trade. In the weeks ahead, we will be setting out how we will bring a new emphasis on well-being in our national life, and how we will work with business to spread social and environmental responsibility across our society. But today, I want to set out what this government will do at home to help drive growth. There are three parts to our strategy. First, using all available policy levers to create the right framework for enterprise and business investment. Second, using our resources to get behind those industries where Britain enjoys competitive advantages. Third, using our power and muscle to make it easier for new companies and innovations to flourish and create a new economic dynamism. Let me take each in turn. First, providing a competitive environment for private sector growth. Successful, high-growth economies are like ecosystems -they are organic, evolve through trial and error and depend on millions, billions, of individual preferences, choices and relationships. Governments can expect to intelligently design all this as much they can expect to intelligently design the Great Barrier Reef. But what they can do is create an environment in which businesses are confident enough to invest. Today, British businesses are rebuilding their balance sheets because they have relatively strong profit and loss accounts. In the first six months of this year, they ran a financial surplus worth almost five percent of GDP. If we are to get back to strong growth, these profits need to turn into productive investment - and my message to you today is that we are providing the stability for that investment. In five years’ time, we will have balanced the books. The sharp tax rises and huge interest rates you feared, the uncertainty you felt - these are things you no longer need to worry about. With our Budget in June and the Comprehensive Spending Review last week, we took Britain out of the danger zone. The world’s responded. Britain’s borrowing costs have dropped to the lowest for a generation. And the IMF and OECD, you, the CBI, and the thirty-five business leaders who wrote to the Daily Telegraph last week have backed the approach we have taken in tackling the deficit. What’s more within five years, we will have cut corporation tax from twenty-eight percent to twenty-four percent our education reforms and new apprenticeships will have started to expand our skills base and our new one-in, one-out rule for regulation will have stopped the rise of domestic red tape. Add to these our cut in the small business profits rate and the fact we have waived national insurance contributions for new businesses in most areas of the country and you have the conditions to breed confidence and investment and boost productivity for the long-term. And let me give you this assurance, as we control our borders and bring immigration to a manageable level, we will not impede you from attracting the best talent from around the world. But business confidence doesn’t just come from financial and human assets. It comes from physical assets too - from our infrastructure. For too long, we have postponed difficult decisions on this - and it shows. Congestion on our roads cost our economy £20 billion a year. In one year alone, there were fourteen million minutes of delay to rail journeys in our country, costing £1 billion in terms of time lost to passengers. Other countries understand the importance of modern infrastructure to economic growth. China is building tens of thousands of miles of roads, a new network of intercity railway lines and a dozen or so nuclear power plants. While they’ve been moving forwards, we’ve been standing still. Not any more. I can announce today the UK’s first ever national infrastructure plan. It’s a plan to completely update and modernise our infrastructure, so British business is free to compete with the rest of the world. In the Budget, you saw the first parts of this plan, as we did not reduce capital spending compared to the last government’s figures. Last week, in the Spending Review, we went further, and announced an additional £8.6 billion over the next four years for capital spending. Indeed, even in these constrained times, we will invest over £30 billion in transport projects over the next four years - which is more than was invested during the past four years. High-speed speed rail to Birmingham. Crossrail, the Thames Gateway and the underground in London. The Mersey Gateway. Major improvements to the East and West Coast mainlines. All have been given the green light. And today, we are publishing a detailed plan setting out the infrastructure Britain needs and how we will unlock £200 billion worth of public and private sector investment to deliver it. So we’ll work with utility companies to get more investment in our energy, with construction companies on our roads, with the telecommunications industry on broadband. This collaboration is already working. Virgin Media is rolling out a new superfast broadband service this week. Combine that with the support we are giving in rural areas and BT’s planned investment and it will mean that within two years, over thirteen million homes and businesses in the UK - including some in our rural areas - will be hooked up to some of the fastest broadband speeds in the world. This is incredibly exciting - and a clear demonstration of how determined we are to work with you to build the right framework for growth in Britain. Right now, every part of government is thinking about what it can do to support growth from to environmental regulation to local government through better incentives for development so let us know what you think, give us your ideas. Together, we can create the conditions in which business can thrive. The second part of our strategy is getting behind those industries where Britain already enjoys competitive advantages. All over the world, governments are identifying dynamic sectors in their economy and working strategically to strengthen them. In America, President Obama is ramming home the advantage they already enjoy in clean technology with $38 billion of investment. And Germany is building on the success of their car industry by investing €500 million in electric car technology. What they understand is that when you’re looking for growth opportunities you don’t stick a pin in a map and drop down a research centre here or arbitrarily back an industry there - you go with the grain of what is already working. We understand that too. We have great industrial strengths across our country, underpinned by world-beating companies. Green technologies in the North East. Creative industries in London, Manchester and Glasgow. Financial services in Edinburgh. In retail, pharmaceuticals and advanced engineering. We have made the strategic decision to get behind these strengths. You saw the evidence of that in our Spending Review. Yes, money is incredibly tight. But we protected the science budget in cash terms. And we are also investing £220 million in a new world-class Centre for Medical Research and Innovation £1 billion to create one of the world’s first Carbon Capture and Storage demonstration plants, with three more projects to follow and £200 million in low carbon technology, including offshore wind. The potential for Britain to lead in this industry is immense. We don’t just have the wind, we have the first-class research capability and a wealth of experience across the aerospace, engineering and energy sectors. But here’s the problem. We need thousands of offshore turbines in the next decade and beyond - each one as tall as the Gherkin. And manufacturing these needs large factories which have to be on the coast. Yet neither the factories nor these large port sites currently exist. And that, understandably, is putting off private investors. So we’re stepping in. To help secure private sector investment in this technology, we’re providing up to £60 million to meet the needs of offshore wind infrastructure at our ports. And to help move things forward, the Crown Estate will also work with interested ports and manufacturers to realise the potential of their sites. It’s a triple win. It will help secure our energy supplies, protect our planet and the Carbon Trust says it could create 70,000 jobs. And it’s a clear demonstration of the coalition’s approach - alert to those sectors that are strong but could be stronger, alive to the possibilities they promise and active about exploiting them. But the third - and potentially the most exciting - part of our strategy for growth is to make it easier for new companies and innovations to flourish. For well over a century, the shape of successful business remained largely the same. Heavy investment in capital and raw materials. Goods developed, mass-produced and then shipped around the world. Organisations growing slowly and coming to dominate markets for years to come. But in recent decades, that pattern has been blown apart. There has been a surge in new, young, high-growth, highly innovative firms. It wasn’t long ago that Apple, Cisco and Google didn’t even exist - now each one has a market value of over $100 billion. Skype, Facebook and Twitter have generated billions of dollars and reached a global scale more quickly and with less capital than any companies before. And the most innovative firms are growing twice as fast, both in terms of employment and sales, than those that fail to innovate. The impact this change is having on our economic landscape is unprecedented. In 1950, the average life of a company in the S&P index was forty-seven years. By 2020, it will fall to just ten years. And today, many more of our jobs are dependent on new, young and dynamic businesses. It’s astonishing to think that between 1980-2005, nearly all net job creation in the United States occurred in firms less than five years old. And here in Britain, just six per cent of UK businesses are high-growth but they generated over half of the net employment growth between 2005 and 2008. All this has massive policy implications for government. To build that new dynamism in our economy, to create the growth, jobs and opportunities Britain needs we’ve got to back the big businesses of tomorrow, not just the big businesses of today. That means opening up access to finance, creating an attractive environment for venture capital funding, getting banks lending to small businesses again and insisting that a far greater proportion of government procurement budgets are spent with small and medium-sized firms. And in the days and months ahead we will be setting out our plans in all these areas. But today I want to focus on two elements of our approach in particular. One is helping to bridge the gap between innovation and commercial success. The fact is that we are not as good as some of our competitors in turning great ideas on the drawing board into prototypes in a laboratory and actual goods and services people can buy. That’s why I can announce today that we will invest over £200 million in Technology and Innovation Centres over the next four years. These centres will sit between universities and businesses, bringing the two together. They won’t just carry out their own in-house research, they will spread knowledge too connecting businesses - large and small, new and old - to potential new technologies, making them aware of funding streams and providing access to skills and equipment. It’s the sort of thing you see in Orgreave, where the University of Sheffield, Rolls Royce and Boeing are all working together or in Germany, where their Fraunhofer Institutes have been crucial in developing the MP3 licence. These centres will be great for research, great for business - and they’re going to put Britain back at the top table for innovation. Another area where I am determined we help is through spreading competition. I believe in competition. I believe when new entrants challenge big business, everyone wins. This hasn’t always been the view of the government. In the 1980s, initially the government attempted to build British Telecom and Cable and Wireless into ‘national champions’ by sheltering them from competition. This approach failed - and today there are more than 5500 telecommunications companies in Britain, generating a turnover of £60 billion and employing over 200,000 people. But today, some industries are too uncompetitive, with significant barriers to entry and obstacles to growth. We’re going to challenge the status quo. As Vince Cable will tell you later today, we will merge the competition functions of the Office of Fair Trading and Competition Commission and introduce a range of other changes, to create a much tougher and more streamlined competition regime. We want to reduce the uncertainty and the length of time it takes to make a decision in the current system. Above all, we want to help new companies break into existing markets. When we say we’re going to build a new economic dynamism - we mean it. Today I have set out this government’s strategy for growth. In some ways it’s wrong to call it a strategy - it’s more a wholesale change in attitude. Where there was neglect about maintaining a basic framework for business, we are bringing a pro-enterprise attitude - dealing with the deficit, cutting business taxes, investing in infrastructure. Where there was complacency about our competitive advantages, we are bringing an hands-on attitude - consolidating those strengths, getting behind key industries in every region of our country. And where there was a backward-looking, unhelpful approach to innovation and start-ups we are bringing an optimistic attitude - backing the young insurgent companies, pulling down the barriers that are holding them back. This is, of course, just the beginning. In the weeks and months ahead, Ministers will be developing detailed plans to turn this strategy into action. Everything - from bank lending to skills, green tech to high tech, competition to innovation, international trade to local growth - will be put under the microscope. That forensic, relentless focus on growth is what you will get from this government. What I need in return from you is a commitment to create and innovate; to invest and grow; to develop and break boundaries. The new jobs, the new products, the new ideas that will lift us up will be born in the factories and offices you own - not in the corridors of Whitehall. So take advantage of the changes we are making, and work with me in returning this country to prosperity. I know this can happen. I passionately believe our best years are ahead of us. Together we can make the years ahead the most entrepreneurial and dynamic in our country’s history.",Prime Minister,David Cameron,https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/pms-speech-on-creating-a-new-economic-dynamism,,DEVELOPMENT
USA,14-04-2021 00:00,Joe Biden,Remarks by President Biden on the Way Forward in Afghanistan,"THE PRESIDENT:  Good afternoon.  I’m speaking to you today from the Roosevelt — the Treaty Room in the White House.  The same spot where, on October of 2001, President George W. Bush informed our nation that the United States military had begun strikes on terrorist training camps in Afghanistan.  It was just weeks — just weeks after the terrorist attack on our nation that killed 2,977 innocent souls; that turned Lower Manhattan into a disaster area, destroyed parts of the Pentagon, and made hallowed ground of a field in Shanksville, Pennsylvania, and sparked an American promise that we would “never forget.”

We went to Afghanistan in 2001 to root out al Qaeda, to prevent future terrorist attacks against the United States planned from Afghanistan.  Our objective was clear.  The cause was just.  Our NATO Allies and partners rallied beside us.  And I supported that military action, along with overwhelming majority of the members of Congress.

More than seven years later, in 2008, weeks before we swore the oath of office — President Obama and I were about to swear — President Obama asked me to travel to Afghanistan and report back on the state of the war in Afghanistan.  I flew to Afghanistan, to the Kunar Valley — a rugged, mountainous region on the border with Pakistan.  What I saw on that trip reinforced my conviction that only the Afghans have the right and responsibility to lead their country, and that more and endless American military force could not create or sustain a durable Afghan government. 

I believed that our presence in Afghanistan should be focused on the reason we went in the first place: to ensure Afghanistan would not be used as a base from which to attack our homeland again.  We did that.  We accomplished that objective. 

I said, among — with others, we’d follow Osama bin Laden to the gates of hell if need be.  That’s exactly what we did, and we got him.  It took us close to 10 years to put President Obama’s commitment to — into form.  And that’s exactly what happened; Osama bin Laden was gone. 

That was 10 years ago.  Think about that.  We delivered justice to bin Laden a decade ago, and we’ve stayed in Afghanistan for a decade since.  Since then, our reasons for remaining in Afghanistan are becoming increasingly unclear, even as the terrorist threat that we went to fight evolved.

Over the past 20 years, the threat has become more dispersed, metastasizing around the globe: al-Shabaab in Somalia; al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula; al-Nusra in Syria; ISIS attempting to create a califit [caliphate] in Syria and Iraq, and establishing affiliates in multiple countries in Africa and Asia. 

With the terror threat now in many places, keeping thousands of troops grounded and concentrated in just one country at a cost of billions each year makes little sense to me and to our leaders.  We cannot continue the cycle of extending or expanding our military presence in Afghanistan, hoping to create ideal conditions for the withdrawal, and expecting a different result. 

I’m now the fourth United States President to preside over American troop presence in Afghanistan: two Republicans, two Democrats.  I will not pass this responsibility on to a fifth.

After consulting closely with our allies and partners, with our military leaders and intelligence personnel, with our diplomats and our development experts, with the Congress and the Vice President, as well as with Mr. Ghani and many others around the world, I have concluded that it’s time to end America’s longest war.  It’s time for American troops to come home. 

When I came to office, I inherited a diplomatic agreement, duly negotiated between the government of the United States and the Taliban, that all U.S. forces would be out of Afghanistan by May 1, 2021, just three months after my inauguration.  That’s what we inherited — that commitment. 

It is perhaps not what I would have negotiated myself, but it was an agreement made by the United States government, and that means something.  So, in keeping with that agreement and with our national interests, the United States will begin our final withdrawal — begin it on May 1 of this year. 

We will not conduct a hasty rush to the exit.  We’ll do it — we’ll do it responsibly, deliberately, and safely.  And we will do it in full coordination with our allies and partners, who now have more forces in Afghanistan than we do. 

And the Taliban should know that if they attack us as we draw down, we will defend ourselves and our partners with all the tools at our disposal. 

Our allies and partners have stood beside us shoulder-to-shoulder in Afghanistan for almost 20 years, and we’re deeply grateful for the contributions they have made to our shared mission and for the sacrifices they have borne.

The plan has long been “in together, out together.”  U.S. troops, as well as forces deployed by our NATO Allies and operational partners, will be out of Afghanistan before we mark the 20th anniversary of that heinous attack on September 11th. 

But — but we’ll not take our eye off the terrorist threat.  We’ll reorganize our counterterrorism capabilities and the substantial assets in the region to prevent reemergence of terrorists — of the threat to our homeland from over the horizon.  We’ll hold the Taliban accountable for its commitment not to allow any terrorists to threaten the United States or its allies from Afghan soil.  The Afghan government has made that commitment to us as well.  And we’ll focus our full attention on the threat we face today. 

At my direction, my team is refining our national strategy to monitor and disrupt significant terrorist threats not only in Afghanistan, but anywhere they may arise — and they’re in Africa, Europe, the Middle East, and elsewhere. 

I spoke yesterday with President Bush to inform him of my decision. While he and I have had many disagreements over policies throughout the years, we’re absolutely united in our respect and support for the valor, courage, and integrity of the women and men of the United States Armed Forces who served.  I’m immensely grateful for the bravery and backbone that they have shown through nearly two decades of combat deployments.  We as a nation are forever indebted to them and to their families. 

You all know that less than 1 percent of Americans serve in our armed forces.  The remaining 99 percent of them — we owe them.  We owe them.  They have never backed down from a single mission that we’ve asked of them.

I’ve witnessed their bravery firsthand during my visits to Afghanistan.  They’ve never wavered in their resolve.  They’ve paid a tremendous price on our behalf.  And they have the thanks of a grateful nation.

While we will not stay involved in Afghanistan militarily, our diplomatic and humanitarian work will continue.  We’ll continue to support the government of Afghanistan.  We will keep providing assistance to the Afghan National Defenses and Security Forces. 

And along with our partners, we have trained and equipped a standing force of over 300,000 Afghan personnel today and hundreds of thousands over the past two decades.  And they’ll continue to fight valiantly, on behalf of the Afghans, at great cost.  They’ll support peace talks, as we will support peace talks between the government of Afghanistan and the Taliban, facilitated by the United Nations.  And we’ll continue to support the rights of Afghan women and girls by maintaining significant humanitarian and development assistance.

And we’ll ask other countries — other countries in the region — to do more to support Afghanistan, especially Pakistan, as well as Russia, China, India, and Turkey.  They all have a significant stake in the stable future for Afghanistan. 

And over the next few months, we will also determine what a continued U.S. diplomatic presence in Afghanistan will look like, including how we’ll ensure the security of our diplomats.

Look, I know there are many who will loudly insist that diplomacy cannot succeed without a robust U.S. military presence to stand as leverage.  We gave that argument a decade.  It’s never proved effective — not when we had 98,000 troops in Afghanistan, and not when we were down to a few thousand.

Our diplomacy does not hinge on having boots in harm’s way — U.S. boots on the ground.  We have to change that thinking.  American troops shouldn’t be used as a bargaining chip between warring parties in other countries.  You know, that’s nothing more than a recipe for keeping American troops in Afghanistan indefinitely. 

I also know there are many who will argue that we should stay — stay fighting in Afghanistan because withdrawal would damage America’s credibility and weaken America’s influence in the world.  I believe the exact opposite is true. 

We went to Afghanistan because of a horrific attack that happened 20 years ago.  That cannot explain why we should remain there in 2021. 

Rather than return to war with the Taliban, we have to focus on the challenges that are in front of us.  We have to track and disrupt terrorist networks and operations that spread far beyond Afghanistan since 9/11.

We have to shore up American competitiveness to meet the stiff competition we’re facing from an increasingly assertive China.  We have to strengthen our alliances and work with like-minded partners to ensure that the rules of international norms that govern cyber threats and emerging technologies that will shape our future are grounded in our democratic values — values — not those of the autocrats. 

We have to defeat this pandemic and strengthen the global health system to prepare for the next one, because there will be another pandemic. 

You know, we’ll be much more formidable to our adversaries and competitors over the long term if we fight the battles for the next 20 years, not the last 20. 

And finally, the main argument for staying longer is what each of my three predecessors have grappled with: No one wants to say that we should be in Afghanistan forever, but they insist now is not the right moment to leave. 

In 2014, NATO issued a declaration affirming that Afghan Security Forces would, from that point on, have full responsibility for their country’s security by the end of that year.  That was seven years ago. 

So when will it be the right moment to leave?  One more year, two more years, ten more years?  Ten, twenty, thirty billion dollars more above the trillion we’ve already spent? 

“Not now” — that’s how we got here.  And in this moment, there’s a significant downside risk to staying beyond May 1st without a clear timetable for departure. 

If we instead pursue the approach where America — U.S. exit is tied to conditions on the ground, we have to have clear answers to the following questions: Just what conditions require to — be required to allow us to depart?  By what means and how long would it take to achieve them, if they could be achieved at all?  And at what additional cost in lives and treasure?

I’m not hearing any good answers to these questions.  And if you can’t answer them, in my view, we should not stay.  The fact is that, later today, I’m going to visit Arlington National Cemetery, Section 60, and that sacred memorial to American sacrifice. 

Section sisty [sic] — Section 60 is where our recent war dead are buried, including many of the women and men who died fighting in Afghanistan and Iraq.  There’s no — there’s no comforting distance in history in Section 60.  The grief is raw.  It’s a visceral reminder of the living cost of war. 

For the past 12 years, ever since I became Vice President, I’ve carried with me a card that reminds me of the exact number of American troops killed in Iraq and Afghanistan.  That exact number, not an approximation or rounded-off number — because every one of those dead are sacred human beings who left behind entire families.  An exact accounting of every single solitary one needs to be had. 

As of the day — today, there are two hundred and forty- — 2,488 [2,448] U.S. troops and personnel who have died in Operation Enduring Freedom and Operation Freedom’s Sentinel — our Afghanistan conflicts.  20,722 have been wounded. 

I’m the first President in 40 years who knows what it means to have a child serving in a warzone.  And throughout this process, my North Star has been remembering what it was like when my late son, Beau, was deployed to Iraq — how proud he was to serve his country; how insistent he was to deploy with his unit; and the impact it had on him and all of us at home. 

We already have service members doing their duty in Afghanistan today whose parents served in the same war.  We have service members who were not yet born when our nation was attacked on 9/11. 

War in Afghanistan was never meant to be a multi-generational undertaking.  We were attacked.  We went to war with clear goals.  We achieved those objectives.  Bin Laden is dead, and al Qaeda is degraded in Iraq — in Afghanistan.  And it’s time to end the forever war. 

Thank you all for listening.  May God protect our troops.  May God bless all those families who lost someone in this endeavor.",President,Joe Biden,https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/speeches-remarks/2021/04/14/remarks-by-president-biden-on-the-way-forward-in-afghanistan/,,INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS
Russia,05-08-2005 00:00,Vladimir Putin,Opening Address at the Meeting with CIS Heads of State,"Good afternoon, dear colleagues and friends,

I am very glad to welcome you all here on Moscow on the eve of Victory Day.

The peoples of our nation made the main, decisive contribution to the defeat of Nazism. This victory was achieved by them through suffering, by innumerable victims, by a joint struggle and effort.

Today, by the joint efforts of CIS member countries, a great deal has been done to give the anniversary of Victory the widest and most objective resonance.

It was on our initiative that the UN General Assembly declared 8–9 May of this year to be Days of reconciliation and memory. It called for nations to unite their efforts in the fight against the ideological successor of Nazism, terrorism, and also against doctrines founded on racism and xenophobia.

I am certain that the CIS is capable of becoming an effective tool in this joint effort.

I think that at this time it will also be beneficial to draw the attention of the international community to the address we passed in Astana in September 2004 regarding the 60th anniversary of Victory.

This document from a position of historical objectivity gives assessments of the nature of the Second World War and the role and contribution of peoples of the former USSR in achieving victory over Nazism.

New generations of our citizens must know the truth about the events of those years. To know this truth means to be immune to propaganda of extremism and xenophobia, national and religious discord. Ultimately, it means to protect the world from a repeat of conflicts and wars founded on genocide, nationalism and racism.

It is clear for all of us: Nazism, extremism and terrorism are threats that feed on the same ideology. The threats are terrible, and we are simply obliged to protect our unique peaceful community of civilisations from these dangers.

I am certain that today it is extremely important to work together on confirming the principles of tolerance and respect between peoples, and teach the young generation solidarity and the ability to fight together against common difficulties and threats.

Preserving our historical and cultural unity, the common values we have developed over centuries, is a firm foundation for realising an entire range of integration processes, for stable and confident development of our countries in this difficult modern era.

As you know, Russia, together with the European Union, is consistently developing a project of four common spaces, including the humanitarian space. It is culture, science, education and humanitarian cooperation which together work effectively to bring people closer together, to form an atmosphere of mutual understanding, trust and mutual respect. And thus the best conditions are created for dialogue and partnership in all spheres of international cooperation – in the economy, politics, and other areas.

I expect that the countries of the CIS – in the new historical conditions and using the opportunities that have opened up for them – are now capable of realising very useful, interesting and promising projects in the humanitarian sphere. Projects which bring our peoples noticeable benefits and which they definitely need.

I believe that our support of the Declaration of humanitarian cooperation will stimulate real work in expanding and developing direct human contacts in the CIS area. It will make it possible on a modern basis to build mutually beneficial relationships in the cultural and humanitarian sphere.

Dear friends,

For all the peoples of the Soviet Union, the war against Nazism became the Great Patriotic War.

Without exaggeration, it was a just war – for the very right to life on the Earth, to have statehood, language and culture. A war for the free development of our peoples, against the ideology of barbarism, violence, aggression, nationalism and racism.

Decades go by, but the memory of the military brotherhood – in the name of freedom, independence and humanism – still binds our peoples.

And it remains for us to pass on this invaluable experience of unity and solidarity to new generations of our fellow citizens.

Thank you for your attention.",President,Vladimir Putin,http://en.kremlin.ru/events/president/transcripts/statements/22957,,NATIONALISM
USA,13-12-2013,Barack Obama,"
Remarks by the President Before Meeting With Newly Elected Mayors"," Well, it is a great pleasure to welcome not only some of the most outstanding mayors in the country, but also folks who are representing incredible cities, world-class cities, that are going to be central to America’s economic growth and progress for years to come.

I've always said that mayors don't have time to be ideological, and they don't really have time to be partisan, because they, every day, are held accountable for concretely delivering the services that people count on all across the country.  And I think it’s for that reason that when we think about mayors, we think about folks who actually get stuff done.

This is an outstanding group of both mayors and mayors-elect, representing some of our largest cities.  They have a shared vision of cities as being critical hubs in which we're creating jobs; bringing businesses; seeing startups develop; making sure that there are pathways, gateways for opportunity for people from the surrounding areas, the surrounding states, the regions, and in many cases, the world, because I think you’ve got a lot of immigrant populations that naturally gravitate towards the diversity and dynamism of the city.

And although we have seen terrific progress in our cities, as we have across the country over the last several years -- millions of jobs being created, the housing market starting to recover, businesses investing again, manufacturing making an extraordinary comeback -- what we know is we've still got a lot of work to do to deliver a vision that we all share, which is an America where if you work hard you can make it. 

And what that means is, is that my hope and goal out of this meeting is we immediately set up a strong partnership with all the mayors here and all the mayors who aren't here where we get a clear sense of what their vision is and how they’re trying to deliver services; how we can make sure that our kids are getting the very best education possible; how we make sure that we are creating the platforms, the infrastructure for jobs to succeed -- or jobs to be created and businesses to succeed in these cities; how we make sure our transportation dollars are flowing in a way that maximizes economic development that hopefully reduces congestion and rush-hour traffic -- I suspect that's something that some of you have heard from your constituents about -- (laughter) -- how we make sure that there’s a strong social safety net there that is not a place where people stay over the long term but rather is a mechanism whereby people who have had some bad luck can get back on their feet and get back into the workforce.

So I'm very much looking forward to the conversation.  In the meantime, at the federal level, there’s some things that we can do to help mayors.  If we, in fact, can get this budget deal completed and out of the Senate, we can get away for the first time in a couple of years from the constant brinksmanship and crisis governance that we've seen up on Capitol Hill that impedes growth and makes businesses and investors less certain about wanting to put their money in.  So that would be an important achievement and that's something the federal government can do to help make.

One element that's not in this budget that needs to be passed right away is UI -- unemployment insurance.  You’ve got potentially 1.3 million people who, during Christmastime, are going to lose their unemployment benefits, at a time when it’s still very difficult for a lot of folks to find a job.  And that's not just bad for those individuals and for those families, that's bad for our economy and that's bad for our cities, because if they don't have the money to pay the rent or be able to buy food for their families, that has an impact on demand and businesses and it can have a depressive effect generally.  In fact, what we know is the economists have said failing to extend unemployment benefits is going to have a drag on economic growth for next year.

So there are some basic things that we can do just to create a better economic environment for these outstanding mayors.  There are some areas -- for example, raising the minimum wage -- that could have a tremendous boost in a lot of the cities where there are a lot of service workers who get up and do some of the critical work for all of us every single day but oftentimes still find themselves just barely above poverty or, in some cases, below poverty. 

So what I want to do is explore ideas with them.  We wish them luck.  You can see that it’s a diverse group, but what binds them together is a commitment to helping people succeed in this country. 

And so I want to congratulate all of them and I'm looking forward to, over the next three years for me, working with them for the benefit of their constituencies.  Many of them may end up being around for 20 years and -- (laughter) -- so they’ll have other Presidents to work with.

But thank you so much for coming in. ",President,Barack Obama,https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/the-press-office/2013/12/13/remarks-president-meeting-newly-elected-mayors,,NATIONALISM
China,29-06-2021 00:00,H.E. Wang Yi,Promote Solidarity and Cooperation In Pursuit of Multilateralism,"Colleagues,

At present, the world still faces a grim situation of COVID-19. Economic recovery varies from country to country. The G20 needs to advocate the spirit of partnership and make efforts in the following five aspects:

First, G20 members need to stay united and work together to lead the way in the global fight against COVID-19. To deliver the outcomes of the Global Health Summit at a faster pace, the G20 needs to, in a science-based manner, step up cooperation on vaccines, diagnostics and therapeutics, coordinate COVID-response efforts, and provide stronger support for developing countries. To date, China has provided over 450 million doses of vaccines to nearly 100 countries. We call on countries with the relevant capacity to refrain from imposing export restrictions and excessive hoarding, and do their part in closing the immunization gap.

Second, G20 members need to uphold multilateralism and rally more support for the stability of the international order. It is important for the G20 to lead by example and practice true multilateralism. We need to firmly uphold the UN-centered international system and international order underpinned by international law. We need to pursue openness and inclusiveness, and oppose seclusion and exclusion. We need to pursue win-win cooperation, and oppose zero-sum game. Multilateralism is not a high-sounding slogan, still less a facade for unilateralism.

Third, G20 members need to enhance openness and coordination, and forge greater impetus to global recovery. We G20 members need to adopt responsible macro-economic policies that have no spillovers to others and that serve the stability of international economic and financial systems. We need to make steadfast efforts to build an open world economy, and keep global supply and industrial chains secure and stable. We need to prevent fragmentation of the international market and politicization of cooperation mechanisms, and dismiss ideology-based rules and standards. We need to advance structural reform in pursuit of high-quality and resilient recovery.

Fourth, G20 members need to uphold inclusiveness and sharing, and garner stronger efforts for sustainable development. We need to scale up efforts to advance the implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. We need to conduct international climate cooperation in the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities. We also need to prevent the formulation of new trade and investment barriers. China and African countries have jointly launched the Initiative on Partnership for Africa's Development. We welcome more countries and international organizations to join the Initiative.

Fifth, G20 members need to take a problem-oriented approach, and make the global governance system more responsive. We need to strengthen the role of the World Health Organization, and build up the global disease prevention and control system. We need to uphold the authority and effectiveness of the multilateral trading system, and resume the normal operation of the WTO Appellate Body as soon as possible. The 16th General Quota Review of the International Monetary Fund needs to be completed as scheduled. In new areas such as digital economy and AI, we need to shore up the weak links in the rules-making, so as to bring new impetus for world economic transformation and growth.

Colleagues,

The Communist Party of China (CPC) is about to celebrate its centenary. Over the past one hundred years, the CPC has rallied and led the Chinese people to embark on the path of socialism with Chinese characteristics that suits China and has strong support from the Chinese people. Such endeavors have benefited not only the Chinese people, but also the whole world. China has lifted over 700 million people out of poverty, contributing over 70 percent of the global poverty reduction. In the last 20 years after joining the WTO, China has fully honored its commitments upon the accession, and expanded its opening-up. China has contributed nearly 30 percent of global growth on annual average. At trying times such as the international financial crisis and COVID-19 pandemic, China never gives up solidarity and partnership with other countries.

China is ready to work with all parties for the success of the Rome Summit and toward building a community with a shared future for mankind!

Thank you.",State Councilor and Foreign Minister of the People's Republic of China,Xi Jinping,https://www.fmprc.gov.cn/mfa_eng/wjdt_665385/zyjh_665391/t1888054.shtml,,INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS
Russia,19-03-2002,Vladimir Putin,Opening Address at a Meeting of Russian Jewish Communities’ Spokesmen,"I am glad to greet you in the Kremlin.

As you know, the Government and the head of state have lately been paying special attention to civil inter-faith peace in Russia to promote friendship and understanding between ethnic entities and religious communities.

Russia will not survive unless we put insurmountable obstacles in the way of all kinds of xenophobia, and ethnic and religious extremism. That is one of the main challenges in our multi-denominational and multi-ethnic country. Of this I am deeply convinced.

As I have repeatedly said in my public addresses, Russia is a unique land, in a sense—it is a country where Christianity, Judaism and Islam have harmoniously coexisted for centuries. Their alloy is an inalienable part of European culture and the basis of the multi-ethnic Russian nation’s strength.

In this connection, I want to point out the Jewish people’s contribution to the development of this country. I don’t want to sound commonplace, so I shall not mention things everyone knows—the contribution of particular ethnic entities to Russian literature and multi-ethnic Russian culture. I want to highlight recent events—some initiatives from the Jewish community in our extremely sensitive foreign political moves and plans. These are positive initiatives—suffice it to mention an appeal to your colleagues in the United States to abolish the Jackson-Vanik amendment in respect of trade with Russia. We know the process is making headway, and I thank you for it. While in the United States, I had very encouraging meetings with Congressmen representing relevant public organisations. We had a good, serious conversation. We regard the policy of certain Jewish public organisations in the United States as continuing that conversation. In particular, we paid attention to a letter from one of those organisations to the US Administration. It was the American Jewish Congress, if I am not mistaken. The message called to shift a part of US petroleum economic interests from some long-established energy exporters to Russia. I think it was a correct initiative, and I hope it will be echoed in my meetings with the US President in May.

That is all I intended to say in the beginning. I congratulate you, and all Jews in Russia, on the approaching Pesach. The word means “Passover”, and I hope we shall pass over all our problems.",President,Vladimir Putin,http://en.kremlin.ru/events/president/transcripts/statements/21538,,OTHERS
Russia,17-02-2006,Vladimir Putin,Speech at an Enlarged Meeting of the Interior Ministry Collegium on the Results of 2005,"Good afternoon dear colleagues!

In many respects 2005 can be seen as a stage in the development of the Russian Interior Ministry. In practice we have overcome the decline in the work of the main services and divisions. The department's new organizational structure has passed the test.

In the overwhelming majority of Russian regions the number of crimes that are being investigated has increased. There are positive tendencies in improving the quality of the preliminary investigation and inquiry. The number of affairs that prosecutors return to the Interior Ministry for additional investigation is decreasing.

A number of federal laws and programmes designed to increase the effectiveness of our crime prevention activities have been adopted at the initiative and with the participation of the Ministry. And as a whole quite a bit was done last year to strengthen our country's internal security and to improve the protection of the rights and freedoms of our citizens.

But I think that you are well aware that there are still quite a few problems, including systemic ones. I believe that we should pay extremely close attention to these problems during today's session.

The situation concerning criminal justice in the country is still difficult. Last year about a million serious and very serious crimes were registered.

At the same time the practice of preventing crimes from being recorded, a practice that we have already mentioned in past years, is far from being eradicated.

Public opinion surveys show that the police receive one of the lowest trust ratings when evaluated next to other law enforcement agencies, and state and public institutions. This is to our regret.

People who have asked the police for help at times encounter not simply indifference but outright arbitrary treatment. There are frequent cases in which Interior Ministry personnel have directly violated the rights of citizens, including while carrying out investigations.

It is obvious that such a situation is directly linked with a low level of professionalism among some employees of the police and the shortcomings in human resources and training work. I shall add that this problem to some extent concerns the whole law enforcement system. A high level of judicial education, of legal culture, is one of the basic conditions for ensuring the worthy service of those whose task is not just to observe the law but to work to make it stronger.

In addition the policy of ridding the system of bribe-takers, of people who have transformed their service into some version of a profitable business, must be firm and profound.

Therefore I am convinced that we need an effective system of civil supervision for the work of law enforcement agencies. Especially in the sphere of observing citizens' constitutional rights and legal interests. Without support from the people, from the institutes of civil society, we cannot accomplish the extremely important task of preventing extremism and criminality as a whole. I ask that you not forget this.

At the recent meeting of the Prosecutor General we drew attention to the increase in crimes due to xenophobia, ethnic, national or religious intolerance. Moreover the activity of extremist groups is becoming more aggressive and taking on harsher forms.

We must recognize that law enforcement agencies have underestimated the danger of this phenomenon and have not yet managed to react in an appropriate way, or established a productive and systematic way to prevent conflicts that have ethnic or religious motives.

I think that we do not need to be reminded of the great danger that all of these phenomena represent for our multinational and multireligious country. Militant nationalism and calling for interethnic tensions represent a direct threat to the life and constitutional rights of citizens, interfere with the stability of the state and undermine its integrity. And of course Russia's image on the world stage suffers a huge loss.

One more important aspect of your work is counterterrorism. Coordinated action between all law enforcement agencies, including structures within the Interior Ministry and the Interior Troops, has allowed us to neutralize some serious operations, including the attack by criminal gangs in Nalchik.

However law enforcement agencies and special services should work even more actively towards getting ahead. They must purposefully expose and eliminate terrorist underground structures, deprive them of their infrastructure, communications, sources of financing, just as was recently done in Stavropol and now in Dagestan.

As you know we just signed a decree on counterterrorism measures. We formed a National Antiterrorist Committee and it is composed of various federal agencies as well as regional antiterrorist commissions and permanently functioning operative staff headed by the leaders of the regional divisions of the FSB at the level of the subjects of the Russian Federation.

These measures must improve government managing and planning in the field of counterterrorism. I expect from you effective, competent participation in teamwork with other law enforcement agencies.

I shall separately address the roles of the Interior Ministry in counteracting crimes in the sphere of the economy. Here it is necessary to give paramount attention to protecting small and medium businesses, lawful conscientious citizens and entrepreneurs from criminality. I shall especially emphasize that as it resolves such problems the Interior Ministry should not allow itself to become involved in corporate conflicts and in disputes between economic actors, and should not take the side of one of the parties in this conflict.

Finally there is one last important theme. The Russian Interior Ministry has received a great deal of responsibility in connection with the Russian presidency of the G8. It is your Ministry that is responsible for organizing the meeting between interior ministers, justice ministers and prosecutors general of the G8 member states.

It is important to use this meeting to maximum advantage, including for even closer cooperation with foreign colleagues in spheres such as the struggle with international terrorism and counteracting illegal trafficking of weapons and drugs. These contacts should be used for further clarifying Russia's position on key questions of cooperation.

And in conclusion I would like to wish you and your colleagues success in this duty that is extremely important and significant for the state and society.

Thank you for your attention.",President,Vladimir Putin,http://en.kremlin.ru/events/president/transcripts/statements/23440,,OTHERS
USA,24-11-2021 00:00,Joe Biden,Statement by the President on Remembering Holodomor,"Each November we solemnly honor and pay tribute to the millions of innocent Ukrainians who suffered and perished during the Holodomor – “death by hunger” – in 1932 and 1933.  The men, women, and children who lost their lives during this famine were victims of the brutal policies and deliberate acts of the regime of Joseph Stalin.  This month, as we commemorate those whose lives were taken, let us also recommit ourselves to the constant work of preventing such tragedies in the future and lifting up those who are suffering under the yoke of tyranny today.

The Ukrainian people overcame the horror of the Holodomor, demonstrating their spirit and resilience, and eventually creating a free and democratic society.

United Kingdom,22-Mar-20,Boris Johnson,Prime Minister's statement on coronavirus (COVID-19): 22 March 2020,"Good afternoon everyone Thank you for coming, and thank you to Robert Jenrick, the Communities Secretary, and Dr Jenny Harries, the Deputy Chief Medical Officer. I want again to thank everyone in the country today for the huge effort that we are collectively making. I want to thank the amazing workers in the NHS, everybody working in social care, in every sector, in food distribution, transport, you name it – absolutely everyone who is keeping this country going today. And I want to thank everyone who is being forced to do something differently today. Everyone who didn’t visit their mum for Mother’s Day but Facetimed them, Skyped them, rang them instead. Thank you for your restraint and for what you did. Everyone who was forced to close a pub or a restaurant or a gym or any other business that could have done fantastic businesses on a great day like this. Thank you for your sacrifice, I know how tough it must be. And I can tell you again that this government will be standing behind you – behind British business, behind British workers, employees, self-employed – throughout this crisis. And the reason we are taking these unprecedented steps to prop up businesses, support businesses and support our economy and these preventative measures is because we have to slow the spread of the disease and to save thousands of lives. Today we have come to the stage of our plan that I advertised at the outset, when we first set out the plan of the UK government. When we have to take special steps to protect the particularly vulnerable. I said the moment would come where we needed to shield those with serious conditions. There are probably about 1.5 million in all. And in a minute Robert Jenrick will set out the plan in detail. But this shielding will do more than any other single measure that we are setting out to save life. That is what we want to do. Also to reduce infection and to slow the spread of the disease. We have to do more to make sure that the existing measures that we are taking are having the effect that we want. So it is crucial that people understand tomorrow that the schools are closed. And tomorrow you should not send your child to school unless you have been identified as a key worker. And more generally in the view of the way people have responded over the last few days to the measures we have set out I want to say a bit more about how we interact outdoors. Of course I want people to be able to go to the parks and open spaces and to enjoy themselves – it is crucial for health and mental and physical wellbeing. But please follow the advice and don’t think that fresh air in itself automatically provides some immunity. You have to stay two metres apart; you have to follow the social distancing advice. And even if you think you are personally invulnerable, there are plenty of people you can infect and whose lives will then be put at risk. And I say this now – on Sunday evening – take this advice seriously, follow it, because it is absolutely crucial. And as I have said throughout this process we will keep the implementation of these measures under constant review and, yes of course, we will bring forward further measures if we think that is necessary. Always remember that in following this advice- and I know how difficult that is – that each and every one of us. You are doing your bit in following this advice to slow the spread of this disease. The more we collectively slow the spread, the more time we give the NHS to prepare, the more lives we will save, the faster we will get through this. And always remember – we will get through this, and we will beat it together. Next Robert Jenrick to outline the shielding measures.",Prime Minister,Boris Johnson,https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/pm-statement-on-coronavirus-22-march-2020,,DEVELOPMENT
Russia,25-01-2001,Vladimir Putin,Speech at the Meeting of Russia’s Security Council on the Federal Space Policy,"Good afternoon.

We are here to discuss Russia’s federal policy in the space sphere today.

We all know only too well that there is more to it than Russia’s national prestige, although prestige is important. It involves advanced technologies and promotes Russia’s competitiveness and security. Moreover, it would be no exaggeration to say that today space exploration ensures global stability.

It would be extremely irresponsible to squander the results of the immense work done by the previous generations.

Unfortunately, we have not been making rapid progress in space exploration. The federal target space programme for 1996–2000 was only completed by only 40%. We have not had any notable success in the civilian or military space projects. Research has been virtually suspended. Most of the spacecraft and ground equipment used today is obsolete; its technological resource is stretched to the limit.

As a result, our space systems are no longer effective in upholding the country’s national security. But the military-space component is what makes any country’s armed forces up to modern standards by improving their operational capability. Without this component, it would be impossible to improve global strategic stability.

Space technologies should be given higher priority in industry, especially in research-intensive sectors. Space systems should provide television and radio coverage on Russia’s vast territory. We should seriously consider how to make manufacture and space technologies mutually attractive. And, importantly, we should determine the conditions and principles of interaction between the government and businesses in the use of outer space.

I believe that Russia can benefit from international space cooperation. Along with economic effects and scientific advancements, cooperation projects will promote Russian innovations on the international markets, and will help establish trust between partners and exchange experience and technologies.

Before drafting a relevant state policy, we must determine its principles and set goals. The most important principle, as I see it, is the safety and preservation of the environment in a broader sense – prevention of technology-induced disasters and the militarisation of outer space. Our peaceful space initiatives, formed along these lines, were presented at the Millennium Summit in New York.

I would like to emphasise here that we need to learn how to focus on the most important projects, to channel our resources, to save money and effort, to select priorities and distribute the resources wisely.

In this connection I have to mention the Mir space station, which has been plagued by frequent flaws in the past few years. I agree with the experts who think it is unwise to invest in projects which have long become outdated, and call for a technological breakthrough. So if space engineers decide on sinking the Mir, then those working on the project will still need to see that all the technological requirements are met and the station’s sinking does not entail any technological problems or adverse environmental consequences.

The space programme we are discussing today, the draft space policy of the Russian Federation for the period until 2010, clearly spells out how to achieve the desired effect. This document should help remedy the situation in Russia’s space industry.

But before approving a long-term federal space programme, we need to devise a detailed scheme for its sourcing and financing. What I would like to hear today is a well-argued and economically clear proposal.

In conclusion, let me underline that along with a shortage of funds, there were other reasons for the lamentable situation in Russia’s space industry. A series of presidential decrees and Government instructions had not been fulfilled properly, and no effective measures had been taken in this sphere for the past few years.

So let me point out that all the decisions we make today should be fulfilled unconditionally.

I want to say a few more words behind closed doors, so I would like to thank all the journalists present for their cooperation. Thank you.",President,Vladimir Putin,http://en.kremlin.ru/events/president/transcripts/statements/22325,,DEVELOPMENT
Russia,21-02-2006,Vladimir Putin,Speech at Ceremony Awarding the Highest Azerbaijanian Muslim Order of Sheikh Ul Islam,"Your Holiness,

Dear friends,

It is with gratitude that I receive this distinguished award – the Order of Sheikh Ul Islam. I see it as recognition of Russia’s great contribution towards establishing good relations between the different religions and between the followers of the most diverse faiths. I see it as recognition for Russia’s contribution to promoting a dialogue between cultures and strengthening stability in the Trans-Caucasus region.

The Russian Federation is a secular state, but throughout the ages it has been home to people of many different ethnic groups and faiths, who live in harmony together and respect each other’s convictions.

We in Russia honour and follow the traditions of respect and tolerance for people of the most diverse religious convictions and views. We see this as extremely important not just in our internal political affairs but also on the international stage. This is especially true when we are talking about regions where attempts are sometimes made to use the complex and sometimes dramatic burden of historical legacy as an instrument for stirring up religious and interethnic conflict.

In this respect we greatly value the efforts of the Azerbaijani leadership and the hard work of Muslim leaders to create an atmosphere of cooperation between the religions in the region. We value the firm stand taken with regard to religious extremism and international terrorism.

As you know, Russia is working actively on this issue today with its partners on the international stage, including in many Muslim countries and within the Organisation of the Islamic Conference, to which Russia was unanimously admitted as a permanent observer.

I think it is important in this modern world to strengthen the common moral and spiritual values that all religions share. Belief in goodness and justice, compassion and peace are basic tenets of all the world’s great religions. We support in every way policies that aim at reinforcing dialogue between peoples and religions.

In this respect I welcome the initiative of the Patriarch of the Russian Orthodox Church, Alexii II, to hold the World Summit of Religious Leaders in Moscow on July 4–5.

As we know, all the religions call on their followers to seek mutual understanding with the followers of other religions, and the Holy Koran directly appeals to believers to “cooperate in goodness and piety and not to help in evil and hostility”.

We think that any insults against the feelings of believers are unacceptable and go against fundamental rights. Very sensitive issues such as these call for extreme caution. It is important to think ahead and be able to foresee the serious consequences that even just carelessly spoken words could have. That is not to mention the state authorities, who must be even more careful and responsible in the way they work.

This was something well understood by Azerbaijan’s recognised national leader, Heydar Aliyev. Thanks to his efforts the principle of religious tolerance remained a cornerstone of Azerbaijan’s policy even during the most troubled times.

I think that this firm commitment and faithfulness to this and other principles laid down by Heydar Aliyev are to a considerable extent part of the foundation that is helping Azerbaijan develop effectively today and move forward.

In conclusion I would once again like to say that the key to resolving many of the problems in the region lies precisely in the ability to develop a dialogue between religions, a successful dialogue based on the immense potential for peace that religion has.

We therefore hope very much for the help of prominent representatives of the Muslim clergy and the representatives of other religions working and living in Azerbaijan and in the region in general. We hope very much for help in resolving the issues facing the peoples of this region. ",President,Vladimir Putin,http://en.kremlin.ru/events/president/transcripts/statements/23447,,OTHERS
China,13-05-2020 00:00,H.E. Wang Yi,"Carrying Forward the Shanghai Spirit
To Safeguard the Multilateral System","Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov,
Colleagues,

It's good to see you at this video conference. As the international community is fighting COVID-19, our meeting today among the foreign ministers of SCO member states takes on a special significance. It reflects SCO's fine tradition of solidarity, and demonstrates our firm resolve to work with the rest of the global community to tide over this trying time. Let me first thank Russia, the rotating chair, and Minister Lavrov for your tremendous work in putting this meeting together.

Since the start of COVID-19, we SCO member states have acted in the Shanghai Spirit and contributed our share to the global cooperation in concrete ways. At the most difficult moment in China's fight against the virus, fellow member states have rendered us much-needed, invaluable support. We truly value such kindness. Similarly, our hearts go out to fellow SCO countries who are hit by COVID-19. We have shared with them control and treatment experience without any reservation, dispatched Chinese experts, provided badly-needed medical supplies and facilitated relevant purchases from China. All this has strongly supported the response efforts of relevant countries. We are convinced that under the strong leadership of our leaders, we will win the ultimate victory against the virus.

As we speak, COVID-19 infections continue to spread in the world. People's health and safety are in grave jeopardy. The world economy is under mounting recessional pressure. SCO member states face a daunting challenge. At this difficult time, as a new type of organization for regional cooperation with the largest population, the SCO needs to continue championing the Shanghai Spirit and the vision of a community with a shared future for mankind. It needs to strengthen solidarity and coordination and act proactively. We must bring the ""SCO strength"" to bear on winning an early victory against the virus and getting the economic and social development back on track in the region and beyond. To this end, I wish to propose the following.

First, let us promote solidarity and coordination and jointly win the global fight against COVID-19. As of today, the number of confirmed cases worldwide has reached 4.1 million. Each day, tens of thousands of people are infected, and thousands of lives are lost. In the face of this grim reality and numbers, there is no more important agenda than saving lives, or more urgent task than international solidarity and cooperation.

We call on all governments to rise above differences and frictions, focus on tackling domestic infections, focus on enhancing international cooperation and focus on saving lives, in order to provide the leadership needed to win the fight against COVID-19.

We call on people around the world to defy pessimism and fear and reject attempts to politicize the response, label the virus, and stigmatize any specific country, in order to shore up extensive public support to win the fight against COVID-19.

We call on the media across the world to observe professional ethics, adhere to science and reason, stick to facts and truth, and commit to impartiality and balance, in order to foster a conducive atmosphere for winning the fight against COVID-19.

We need to deliver the SCO leaders' statement on joint efforts against the threat of epidemics adopted at the 2018 Qingdao Summit, and formulate an action-plan as soon as possible to guide anti-epidemic cooperation.

China proposes to optimize the SCO infectious disease notification mechanism, set up an SCO epidemic database and launch collective and coordinated response mechanisms in the border areas between SCO members. Effective measures should remain in place to protect the health and safety of other SCO nationals and students in our respective countries.

China stands ready to provide further assistance to fellow SCO members to the best of its ability, including facilitating the purchases of medical supplies from China. At the same time, China will continue to engage in information-sharing and joint R&D of drugs and vaccines, and work with all others to build a community of health for all.

Second, let us promote security cooperation to jointly safeguard regional peace and stability. With COVID-19 and other factors at play, the world is facing a myriad of traditional and nontraditional security risks and challenges. Common, comprehensive, cooperative and sustainable security should remain our overarching objective. We need to consolidate mutual political trust, support each other's efforts to safeguard political security and social stability, and take security cooperation to greater depth and breadth. We need to join hands and build stronger security safeguards.

We should scale up mutual support and guard against ill-intentioned attempts to sow discord. We must work together to deny terrorists, separatists and extremists any chance to wreak havoc in our region, and take forward cooperation in key areas such as counterterrorism, narcotics control and border management.

Biosecurity-related risks require our close attention. In this area, we need to positively study the establishment of an SCO cooperation and consultation mechanism, strengthen communication on regional and international developments, and jointly advance the institution- and capacity-building for sound governance.

The Afghan peace process has come to a critical juncture. As Afghanistan's close neighbors, SCO member states are duty-bound to play our role in the political settlement of the Afghan issue. We must stay committed to the Afghan-led and Afghan-owned principle, facilitate a broad-based and inclusive peace and reconciliation process, and support Afghanistan in defending its national unity and political stability. The withdrawal of foreign troops must proceed in a responsible and orderly manner, or else terrorist groups may exploit any vacuum in the country and threaten peace in the whole region. The role of the SCO-Afghanistan contact group as a cooperation platform with Afghanistan should be fully harnessed to encourage the main political forces in Afghanistan to seize the opportunity, bridge differences, and break new ground in national reconciliation and reconstruction at an early date.

Third, let us promote mutual benefit and pursue common development. As things stand, we all face the pressing task of stabilizing the economy and ensuring people's well-being. While getting prepared for a possible long-term fight against COVID-19, we must step up policy coordination and think up flexible and diverse ways to further advance Belt and Road cooperation. Such efforts will help minimize the economic and social impact of COVID-19 on our respective countries and build synergy to avert the downward risk on the world economy.

We must focus on keeping industrial and supply chains in our region safe and open. As long as containment measures are properly enforced at road ports on our borders, we need to support the expeditious restoration of their full cargo handling capacity. The China-Europe Railway Express, a lifeline for freight transport, should be put to best use to help our respective countries combat the virus and resume economic activity. To facilitate the movement of key business personnel and those working in essential manufacturing and service sectors and the shipment of critical supplies and raw materials, ""fast lanes"" and ""green lanes"" should be established as quickly as possible.

We need to take multi-pronged measures to foster new areas of cooperation. For instance, we could speed up the commercialization of research outcomes in science, technology and innovation, and carry out cooperation in big data, the Internet of Things, artificial intelligence and 5G. We could increase the use of local currency settlement to jointly fend off financial risks. We welcome the decision of the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB) to create a COVID-19 Crisis Recovery Facility, which will provide financial support to its members, SCO member states included. China will continue to follow through on the 30-billion-yuan equivalent special lending facility within the framework of the SCO Inter-bank Consortium to support member states in growing the economy and improving people's lives. We should also actively implement the SCO Cooperation Program on Food Security, explore new ways of modern agricultural cooperation, and keep the agricultural supply and market stable in our region.

We need to strengthen people-to-people exchange and cultural cooperation. Our media organizations and think tanks should be encouraged to have more interactions on how to present stories of friendship and solidarity as we jointly fight the disease and pursue common development. Such accounts will help spread the positive message of mutual support and assistance in trying times and further cement public support for our wide-ranging cooperation.

Fourth, let us promote multilateralism and jointly defend and improve the international system. This year marks the 75th anniversary of both the victory of the World Anti-Fascist War and the founding of the United Nations. Yet as we speak, the UN-centered international system, established in the wake of World War II, is under attack from the increasingly rampant acts of unilateralism and bullying. In such a context, there emerges an overwhelming chorus among people around the world for the need to draw lessons from history, to safeguard the victorious outcomes of World War II, and to uphold multilateralism and improve global governance.

We must uphold multilateralism, safeguard the purposes and principles of the UN Charter, and maintain the international order anchored in international law. We must firmly reject self-centered moves of unilateralism, and oppose sanctions and ""long-arm jurisdiction"" that have no basis in international law, in an effort to uphold fairness and justice in the world.

We need to seek closer exchanges and cooperation between the SCO and the United Nations and its specialized agencies. Under the current circumstances, it is of special importance that we support the role of the World Health Organization in leading and coordinating the global fight against COVID-19. We should take the initiative to offer SCO solutions to global challenges, and play a more constructive role in improving global governance.

Colleagues,

COVID-19 has affected the daily operation of this organization. In response, we must think creatively to conduct cooperation and exchange in the context of fighting the virus. China will give full support to the Russian presidency. To prepare for the Summit and other important events, we could use videoconference, online discussion and other means to coordinate positions on matters of shared interest in a timely manner and put forward new initiatives and measures to galvanize SCO cooperation in the ""post COVID-19 era"".

While COVID-19 is sure to pass, our friendship and cooperation are here to stay. I am convinced that the SCO will emerge from the COVID-19 test with even stronger cooperation and a closer bond as a community with a shared future. We have a brighter future ahead.",State Councilor and Foreign Minister of the People's Republic of China,Xi Jinping,https://www.fmprc.gov.cn/mfa_eng/wjdt_665385/zyjh_665391/t1778687.shtml,,INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS
China,23-01-2018 00:00,H.E. Wang Yi,Remarks by Foreign Minister Wang Yi at the Opening Ceremony of China-CELAC Economic and Trade Cooperation Forum and China-LAC Business Council Annual Meeting 2018,"Foreign Minister Muñoz,
Entrepreneurs from China and LAC Countries,

Good morning. It is a real pleasure to be here for this exciting gathering of entrepreneurs. On behalf of the Chinese Foreign Ministry, I extend our heartfelt congratulations to you on the opening of the China-CELAC Economic and Trade Cooperation Forum that brings together business leaders of China and LAC countries. As the driving force for innovation and development, entrepreneurs are important participants of China-LAC cooperation. We hope and trust that today's Forum and Annual Meeting will produce broad consensus.

The second Ministerial Meeting of the China-CELAC Forum was concluded yesterday. Foreign Minister Muñoz just went through its outcomes. Let me echo what he said and further highlight the following:

First, China and CELAC agreed that in a world full of uncertainties, we must send out a clear message from here. We must uphold multilateralism and the free trade regime, oppose protectionism, work for an open world economy and a healthy global governance system, and foster a more open, inclusive and balanced economic globalization that benefits all. As the China-CELAC Forum represents developing countries and emerging markets, such a common stand and unified voice from us is highly necessary and timely. As we speak, in the snow-clad town of Davos on the other side of the globe, this important issue is also at the center of discussion.

Second, China and CELAC agreed to jointly build the Belt and Road. As China and other countries work together on the Belt and Road Initiative, LAC countries cannot be absent and should be a meaningful part of it. The ancient Maritime Silk Road had once connected us across the Pacific Ocean. Now in the 21st century, China stands ready to work with LAC countries to revitalize it. Collaboration in this process will create greater space, market as well as resources and means for the development of LAC countries. During the meeting, the Foreign Ministers issued a special declaration on supporting and participating in the Belt and Road Initiative. It means that with the second Ministerial Meeting, this visionary Initiative put forward by President Xi Jinping has been extended to Latin America and the Caribbean, and become the largest and most welcomed platform for international cooperation spanning all continents and oceans. It is also the most important public goods that China provides to the world.

Third, China and CELAC agreed to accelerate economic diversification. As part of the South-South cooperation by nature, China-LAC cooperation is about mutual support and help. LAC countries hope to change their development model largely underpinned by export of primary products. As a good friend, China fully understands this and is ready to help LAC countries enhance capacity for independent development, implement the strategy of economic diversification, advance industrialization and build competitive pillar industries as soon as possible.

With all its outcomes, the second Ministerial Meeting will add fresh impetus to and open up new prospects for the comprehensive cooperative partnership jointly initiated by President Xi Jinping and LAC leaders. It will also propel China-LAC relations in a positive and significant way.

This year marks the 40th anniversary of China's reform and opening-up. Over the past four decades, guided by the right theories, the Chinese people have blazed a successful development path that suits China's national conditions and needs and has won extensive support. This is the path of socialism with Chinese characteristics. At the 19th National Congress of the Communist Party of China, General Secretary Xi Jinping declared to the world that socialism with Chinese characteristics has entered a new era. This Congress has laid out a clear timetable and roadmap for China's development between now and the middle of this century, and identified Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era as the guide to action for us to adhere to on a long-term basis. Under the leadership of the CPC Central Committee with Xi Jinping as the core, the 89 million CPC members will stay united and lead the Chinese people in the endeavor to realize the two centenary goals and national rejuvenation.

I assume that you as entrepreneurs follow China's economy closely. Let me share with you the latest development and progress of the Chinese economy in the new era.

First, China's development philosophy is undergoing a big change. President Xi Jinping has outlined a vision on innovative, coordinated, green and open development that benefits all. Guided by the new vision, we no longer take GDP growth as the sole focus, but have put more emphasis on the quality and efficiency of development. What the people expect their government to deliver on the most are jobs, higher income and cleaner environment in terms of air, water and soil. A China pursuing green, low-carbon and sustainable development serves the well-being of its own people and that of this planet we all call home.

Second, China's economic structure is undergoing a major shift. Among the forces driving growth, the tertiary industry now accounts for over half of GDP in added value, outstripping both the primary and secondary industries. The economic structure is upgrading with consumption contributing over 65% to GDP growth last year. This figure is quickly approaching that in developed countries. This indicates China is on track to become the biggest market in the world. A recent report by a reputable international agency predicted that in 2018 China will, for the first time, overtake the United States in the scale of domestic consumption. This means that beyond 2018, China, not the United States, will be the world's biggest market. Regardless of the accuracy of this forecast, it is to be well expected that the Chinese market, which potentially is three to four times that of the US, will continue the current trend of fast expansion. This will be the natural result of the law of the market, which also dictates that market shares are not to be gained with strong-arm tactics but only with hard work.

Over time, the structure of China's trade with the US and other countries will see a fundamental change. If one visits the US, especially the various states, he or she will see that what the governors and business people there care about the most is not what China can sell to them but what they can sell to China. They are keen to gain wider access to the Chinese market. Such an interest will evolve into an unstoppable momentum. In the future, many other countries and the US may well sell more to China than they buy from us. This may build into a big shift in China's trade structure whereby there will be ever more cases of China running a deficit with its trading partners. When that happens, we will not threaten anyone with something like the Section 301 investigation, nor politicize trade issues. We will continue to follow a positive approach to the workings of new market dynamics and strive to make the pie bigger with greater progress in our business ties with other countries.

Third, China will further open up to the world. President Xi has reaffirmed on many occasions China's commitment to opening its door wider. We are set to introduce the management model based on pre-establishment national treatment and a negative list nationwide. This will create a more enabling environment for foreign investors to access the Chinese market. The Chinese government has decided to host an international import expo annually starting from this year, making China the only major economy in the world to do so. This shows our readiness to further open our market and share its opportunities with all other countries.

Chile has made clear its readiness to participate in the expo. That will see more quality Chilean products, including fresh fruits and wine, make their way into the Chinese market more quickly. Chile is already China's largest source of fresh fruits imports and the second largest source of wine imports. There is still great potential to tap as both countries are committed to opening-up and sensitive to other's needs. We appreciate Chile's innovative spirit. Chilean President and Foreign Minister have put forward the ideas of a ""digital Silk Road"" and an ""air Silk Road"", which are geared to transcend the geographical distance across the vast Pacific Ocean and bind China, Chile and other LAC countries in the pursuit for shared development and prosperity.

What I have just said can all be found in the Report of the 19th Party Congress. General Secretary Xi Jinping stated clearly in the Report that China's economy has been transitioning from a phase of rapid growth to a stage of high-quality development, with a modernized economy being a strategic goal. Going forward, we will deepen the supply-side structural reform, make China a country of innovators, improve the socialist market economy, make new ground in pursuing opening up on all fronts, promote high-level liberalization and facilitation of trade and investment, and significantly ease market access. These important messages speak volume to the broad space and enormous opportunities for further cooperation between China and countries across the world.

The Report of the 19th Party Congress is not just a guide to action for the CPC. It is also the most authoritative textbook to get to know and get closer to China. Read through it and you will find it inspirational and rewarding.

Thank you.",State Councilor and Foreign Minister of the People's Republic of China,Xi Jinping,https://www.fmprc.gov.cn/mfa_eng/wjdt_665385/zyjh_665391/t1529529.shtml,,INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS
Russia,31-07-2008,Dmitry Medvedev,Opening Address at a Meeting to Discuss the Protection of the Property Rights of Small and Medium Businesses,"Good afternoon once again to all those I've already met and to those whom I want to welcome here, including our colleagues from Moscow.

It is no accident that we have gathered here in Gagarin. It is a typical Russian city, beautiful, green, with a developing small business sector that naturally is going through all the problems and difficulties faced by small business in general in our country.

After taking office, one of the first decrees that I signed was the one dated 15 May: “On Urgent Measures aimed at Eliminating Excessive Administrative Restrictions on Carrying out Business Activity”. Under this decree, it was first and foremost assumed that we would prepare and adopt a series of regulations and laws. And as you know some such laws have already been adopted.

They have been adopted along with other federal laws.

We have a whole range of laws prepared to ensure, or pursuant to the decree to ensure, the protection of legal persons and individual entrepreneurs vis-a-vis state and municipal supervision.

We have already taken the first step. But that's it, nothing else. Unfortunately, the problems have not gone away. I am thinking of the challenges faced by our entrepreneurs wherever they do business, small business people and not only them. They are tortured by controls and all sorts of inspections designed to extort money. To sum it up, our law enforcement agencies and authorities must stop turning attempts to set up and run a business into a nightmare. Our colleagues responsible for the relevant law enforcement systems are sitting here today. In our country it is very important what signals get sent. You may want to consider it as a signal being sent. We have a law and a decree on this subject as well as other documents. But most important is the understanding of what may not be done.

On the other hand, those in business need to behave responsibly: they have to pay taxes and do business legally, within the normal legal constraints, and not make use of flagrant, anti-social means of tax dodging. It's understandable that no one likes to pay taxes and that everyone tries to find a way of paying as little as possible, but when businesses act in ways that end up reducing taxes by a factor of four or five, that is simply unacceptable.

As a result, we can say see how a vicious circle has been created: on the one hand, people extract money from business by all these illegal means, while business corrupts the law enforcement agencies. And if we don't break this vicious circle, everything will regress to the embryonic stage.

There's something else: all of these decrees and laws that I just mentioned will be totally useless, they will have absolutely no effect if we do not create a clearly favourable business climate in our country. We need a normal investment climate in our country. And this is a task for absolutely everyone here today, for the authorities in general, for law enforcement agencies and for business. Everyone must be involved in establishing the proper business climate. If we do not work on this together, nothing will come of it.

In order to put an end to this disgraceful situation, I would like to inform you that today I signed a plan on countering corruption, and we will begin work based on it very soon.",President,Dmitry Medvedev,http://en.kremlin.ru/events/president/transcripts/statements/993,,DEVELOPMENT
USA,17-06-2021 00:00,Joe Biden,Statement by President Joe Biden on the U.S. Supreme Court Decision Upholding the Affordable Care Act,"The Affordable Care Act remains the law of the land. 

Today’s U.S. Supreme Court decision is a major victory for all Americans benefitting from this groundbreaking and life-changing law. It is a victory for more than 130 million Americans with pre-existing conditions and millions more who were in immediate danger of losing their health care in the midst of a once-in-a-century pandemic. 

It is a victory for every American who, prior to the Affordable Care Act, stayed up at night staring at the ceiling, wondering whether they would lose everything if they or a loved one got sick. Because of this law, they don’t have to worry about being denied coverage due to a pre-existing condition like diabetes or watching their coverage being capped during a cancer treatment. Because of the law, they are able to get free preventive screenings that can save their lives and improve their health. Today’s victory is also for all the young people who can stay on their parents’ insurance plan until they turn 26 years old, and for the millions of low-income families and people with disabilities receiving health care because their states expanded Medicaid under this law.

After more than a decade of attacks on the Affordable Care Act through the Congress and the courts, today’s decision – the third major challenge to the law that the U.S. Supreme Court has rejected – it is time move forward and keep building on this landmark law.

That is what we are doing thanks to the American Rescue Plan, which has lowered health care costs and expanded coverage for millions of Americans through the Affordable Care Act. More than 1.2 million Americans signed up for coverage under the law through a special enrollment period I established during this pandemic, which people can still sign up for through August 15th. And I look forward to working with the Congress to build on this law so that the American people will continue to have access to quality and affordable health care.

Today’s decision affirms that the Affordable Care Act is stronger than ever, delivers for the American people, and gets us closer to fulfilling our moral obligation to ensure that, here in America, health care is a right and not a privilege.",President,Joe Biden,https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/06/17/statement-by-president-joe-biden-on-the-u-s-supreme-court-decision-upholding-the-affordable-care-act/,,DEVELOPMENT
Russia,21-02-2001,Vladimir Putin,Excerpt from a Speech at a Meeting of the State Council Devoted to the Land Reform," The land issue has historically been a thorny issue for Russia. It has always transcended economics and had profound social and political implications. That is why the issue needs to be handled with the utmost care, and not only in terms of economics and law.

The current situation as regards the legal support of land relations in the country is appalling. As a result we are losing a powerful driver of the country’s development, we fail to use a potentially active marketable commodity and create conditions for political and economic opportunists. The critical situation stems not only from the virtual lack of federal land legislation, but also from the fact that the regions have a free hand in adopting regional laws.

The federal and regional governments need each other if they are to solve the land question. We are well aware that it is impossible to put together a competent federal land policy without drawing on the experience and practice of the Russian regions. No one knows the situation in the regions better than the regional leaders, and you have your own experience of land management. And if we proceed in our joint work from the particular to the general, starting from the ground in the direct and figurative sense of the word, then it will be effective.

During the course of the discussion I urge you to analyse the achievements and the mistakes that have been made and that have to be avoided in the future.

The Government faces three key problems in the field of land relations.

First: regulation of legal aspects of ownership.

Second: inventory of lands.

Third: creating a system of effective management of land resources.

The starting point should be the adoption of a new Land Code. The Government is finalising the new draft. I am sure the quality of that document would depend in many ways on our discussion at the State Council today.

But the Code alone does not create the whole legal framework for land relations.

There exist two approaches to the legal regulation of land relations.

The first is to concentrate everything at the federal level.

The second is to give the regions a maximum of discretion in regulating land relations, but within the framework of federal law.

We have discussed this problem at the Presidium of the State Council. We reached the consensus opinion that the second option is preferable. I know that the overwhelming majority of regional leaders share this position.

The question of turnover of agricultural lands is the most acute part. These lands account for one fourth of the total land. And we must pay special attention to this issue today.

Besides, there are some more specialised issues which are however extremely important if we are to solve the land problems in a comprehensive and reasonable way. I suggest that we touch upon them during the discussion today.

Specifically I am referring to:

The problem of tight control over proper use of land. I think it is important for any country, but especially for our country. Just think of what happens with misuse of resources and what a mess it has led to. The same should not happen to land. The framework law should envisage sanctions for non-targeted use of land in order to deter people from breaking the law.

The role of the land reform in the development of peasant and farming operations. We should also give thought to big farms. We should see how not to forfeit the few gains that have been made so far.

The status of border lands and questions of their purchase and sale. The leaders of the border regions of Russia are worried and urge the need for a particularly thorough approach to the problem of land use in border areas.

Work to finalise the compilation of the Land Cadastre.

Land ownership in cities that have the status of subjects of the Federation: Moscow and St. Petersburg. I think that situation also calls for special regulations. ",President,Vladimir Putin,http://en.kremlin.ru/events/president/transcripts/statements/21189,,DEVELOPMENT
USA,26-03-2015,Barack Obama,"
Remarks by the President at Roundtable on the Economy","Well, it’s wonderful to be here at Lawson State Community College.  I want to thank Dr. Ward for his hospitality.  We're going to end up addressing a much larger crowd, but I wanted to take time while I was here to have a chance to talk to some people who are extraordinarily active here in Alabama around the issue of payday lending, title lending and, frankly, predatory lending.

Here in Alabama, like in many parts of the country, including my home city of Chicago, a lot of folks will come across some difficult times.  Occasionally, something happens -- somebody gets sick in the family -- although now they’ve got the Affordable Care Act.  (Laughter.)  The car may break down at a bad time, a child may need something.  And if things are tight and many of these communities don't have traditional banking services, too often they get steered into payday loans.

And the challenge is that the interest rates that are so often charged on these short-term loans, they can be as high as 400 percent, 450 percent interest.  It means that a $500 loan might require $1,000 in interest on top of the loan.  

And I just was hearing a story from Steven here about a family whose grandmother dies, and they take out a small loan for the funeral, aren’t able to pay it back right away, lose their car, and two members of the family then lose their job, and the entire family’s financial situation collapses.  That's not who we are.  That's not who we should be as a country.

And the good news is that the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau that was set up under Wall Street reform announced today that they're going to be initiating regulations to make sure that we're adhering to a basic principle, which is if we're going to have financial institutions provide loans to families and individuals, they got to make sure that these individuals have the capacity to pay them back; that they're not going to be on the hook and burdened in perpetuity as a consequence of what was a short-term problem.  We don't want that translated then into a long-term financial crisis for these families. 

It’s something that we know states around the country have been able to do, but unfortunately too many states have not yet taken these steps.  By having a federal rule through the Consumer Finance Protection Bureau, we're going to be able to make sure that more and more people get more protection.  And in the meantime, these outstanding folks who are sitting around the table are going to continue to push efforts at the state level to try to make progress.

And it’s important to note that this is not a partisan issue.  There are Republicans, as well as Democrats, who care deeply about this issue.  There are members of the faith community who see a biblical injunction in not engaging in usury and taking advantage of people at moments where they're most vulnerable.  And so we very much appreciate both the Democrats and Republicans here in the state of Alabama who are promoting state-based solutions. 

In the meantime, we're going to make sure that we continue to promote solutions at the federal level, as well.  And I’m very proud of the Consumer Finance Protection Bureau for promulgating these rules.  There’s going to be a comment period.  There’s going to be a lengthy debate.  But I’m going to be on the side of making sure that these rules are as strong as possible.

Okay?  Did I miss any?  Thank you, people.",President,Barack Obama,https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/the-press-office/2015/03/26/remarks-president-roundtable-economy,,DEVELOPMENT
China,03-11-2015 00:00,Li Keqiang,Remarks by H.E. Li Keqiang Premier of the State Council of the People's Republic of China At the Closing Ceremony of the China-France Economy and Climate Summit,"Your Excellency President Francois Hollande,
Distinguished Guests,
Ladies and Gentlemen,
Dear Friends,

It is a great pleasure to join you at the closing ceremony together with President Hollande, and I wish to congratulate you on the successful Summit.

Co-hosted by China and France, the Summit will serve as a prelude to the upcoming UN Conference on Climate Change (COP 21) to be held in Paris.

Both China and France are permanent members of the UN Security Council. Our cooperation on climate change demonstrates the common responsibility we undertake as major countries on vital issues concerning the future of mankind, and it shows that China-France relations have been at the forefront of China's relations with major western countries. Yesterday, President Xi Jinping and President Hollande issued a joint statement on climate change. As I visited France last June, the Chinese government communicated its Intended Nationally Determined Contributions to the Secretariat of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. China highly commends the efforts made by France in addressing climate change and stands ready to work closely with France for a comprehensive, balanced and ambitious agreement at COP 21 according to the principles of common but differentiated responsibilities, equity and respective capabilities, thus making greater contributions to the sustainable development of mankind.

As we speak, global economic recovery remains weak, and downward pressure keeps mounting. Affected by the external environment, growth in China has also moderated. It is clear that the previous growth pattern that relies on over-consumption of natural resources is no longer sustainable. To achieve China's goal of becoming a moderately developed country by the middle of the century, we need to maintain a medium-high speed of growth for years and move to medium-high level of development. The current moderation of growth speed is also partly due to structural adjustments and the enforcement of strict environmental standards. This is a painful process of shifting growth model and growth drivers. Still, we must follow through this path to move away from over-reliance on natural resources and toward greater focus on human resources and new growth points. Only green development is sustainable development. There is great potential for green and environment-related industries.

China and France have started clean energy cooperation as early as the 1980s. Right now, China is pursuing a new type of industrialization and urbanization. The former calls for greater energy conservation, less consumption and more reliance on smart technologies, while the latter holds the potential of being China's biggest source of domestic demand with the urbanization rate just above 50%. For China to pursue a new type of urbanization, it needs more energy-saving materials for construction and other related sectors and more environment-friendly consumer goods for its people. If Chinese and French businesses can work together to meet the demands of Chinese consumers and foster new industries related to energy conservation and environmental protection, it will generate massive benefits for both sides. Thirty years ago, China chose French technology for the first unit of its Daya Bay Nuclear Power Plant, with an installed capacity of less than 1,000 MW. Now, the installed capacity of nuclear power in China both in operation and under construction exceeds 25 GW. There is still greater potential to be tapped.

For developing countries, climate change poses a challenge and combating it entails pain and pressure. But it will also bring sustained and healthy development of their economy. Therefore, green development is not only necessitated by China's shift of growth model and adjustment of economic structure, but is also our bounden responsibility as a major developing country and our contribution to the world. China will implement green development and other decisions adopted at the just-concluded Fifth Plenum of the 18th CPC Central Committee. China will pursue both economic growth and environmental improvement by transforming the growth model, adjusting the structure and improving the quality and performance of the economy. And that will open up new prospects for ecological conservation.

China and France may also jointly explore third-party market in energy-saving and environment-friendly industries. This will bring new technologies, new products and new concepts to the world and help emerging markets address downward economic pressure and achieve sustainable growth.

The fact that President Hollande chose to visit China prior to COP 21 shows that China and France share the same vision for tackling climate change and can forge synergy through cooperation. China looks forward to a successful Paris Conference and hopes that it will help identify new growth areas and pathways for the development of mankind. The outcomes of the Conference shall not only be written down in documents, but also reflected in concrete actions. To push for real results in shifting growth model and restructuring the economy, governments need to provide clear guidance, set standards and give policy support. But more importantly, the business community need to work with each other. It is China's hope that cooperation between the business community of our two countries on green development as well as energy conservation and environmental protection industries will deliver new progress. We hope that France will open up relevant technologies to China and the Chinese companies will honor the rules for intellectual property protection. As China and France deepen mutual trust and strengthen cooperation, we will create more business opportunities in our two countries and beyond, contribute to sustainable development of the global economy, and bring more benefits to the people of our two countries and across the world.

United Kingdom,28-May-20,Boris Johnson,Prime Minister's statement on coronavirus (COVID-19): 28 May 2020," Good evening, Before I set out our next steps in the fight against the coronavirus, let me update you on the latest data: 3,918,079 tests for coronavirus have now been carried out in the UK, including 119,587 tests carried out yesterday; 269,127 people have tested positive, that’s an increase of 1,887 cases since yesterday; 8,560 people are in hospital with coronavirus, down 11% from 9,607 this time last week. And sadly, of those tested positive for coronavirus, across all settings, 37,837 have now died. That’s an increase of 377 fatalities since yesterday and we are with their friends and family in mourning. As you know, we have set five tests which must be met before adjusting the lockdown - as set out on the first slide. It is vital that these tests are met before any changes are made, because we must not risk all the hard work and sacrifice of the British people. At all times we are informed by the data and evidence, about the spread of the virus and the impact of the measures taken so far. I will now take you through our latest assessment of progress against each of the five tests. Next slide please. Our first test is to protect the NHS’s ability to cope, so that we are confident that we are able to provide sufficient critical care and specialist treatment right across the UK. At the start of the outbreak, there was significant concern that the NHS would not be able to cope. That turned out not to be the case, thanks to the heroic efforts of everyone who works in the NHS. And the heroic efforts of the British people to contain this virus. The data show that on 26 May, 475 people were admitted to hospital in England with coronavirus - down from a peak of 3,121 on a single day, on 2 April. On 27 May, 11% of mechanical ventilator beds in the UK were occupied by patients with coronavirus, down from a peak of 41% on 10 April. This significant progress means we are meeting the first test. Can I have the next slide please. Our second test is to see a sustained and consistent fall in the daily death rates from COVID-19 so we are confident that we have moved beyond the peak. As measured by a seven-day rolling average, the UK daily death rate now stands at 256, down from a peak of 943 on 14 April. While every death is one too many, it is now the case that there has been a sustained and consistent fall in the daily death rate, and so the second test is being met. Next slide please. Our third test is to receive reliable information, reliable data from SAGE showing that the rate of infection - the number of people catching Covid - is decreasing to manageable levels across the board. And in the last seven days, an average of 2,312 new cases were confirmed with a positive test, that’s down from a peak of 5,066 in the first week of May. Based on the various data available, the Government is satisfied that the third test is being met. And in a moment, Sir Patrick will tell us more about other methods of measuring infections, including the R number. Next slide please. Our fourth test is that we must be confident that the range of operational challenges, including on testing capacity and Personal Protective Equipment, are in hand, with supply able to meet future demand. I fully acknowledge the difficulties on testing and PPE that we have faced since the start of the outbreak. It has been immensely frustrating, but we are now making progress. Yesterday we carried out 119,587 tests, compared to around 12,000 at the start of April. Testing capacity has now increased to 161,214 a day. We have now signed over 100 new deals with PPE suppliers around the world. Here in the UK, thanks to the efforts of Lord Deighton and his team and the brilliance of domestic manufacturers we have signed contracts for over two billion items of PPE, including facemasks, visors, gowns and aprons. We are therefore satisfied that the fourth test is being met and we can start to rebuild stocks - though we recognise there may be some settings that require urgent restocking on occasion. Can I have the next slide please. Our fifth and final test is that we must be confident that any adjustments to the current measures will not risk a second peak of infections that overwhelms the NHS. I am very grateful to the Chief Scientific Adviser and the Chief Medical Officer for their assessments of the measures I am about to set out on schools, retail and social contact. Although all parts of the UK are moving in the same direction, it is important to note health is devolved and different parts of the UK are quite properly all moving at different speeds. This package has been carefully designed so that we can ease the burdens of lockdown while expecting to keep that R below one. I cannot and will not throw away all the gains we have made together, and so the changes we are making are limited and cautious. It is thanks to the caution we have shown so far that all five tests are being met. That is not my achievement or the government’s achievement - it is your achievement, only possible thanks to your resolve and dedication to our national purpose to overcome this virus. So the result is we can move forward with adjusting the lockdown in England on Monday. Firstly, as I set out on Sunday, we will now reopen schools to more children. Closing schools has deprived children of their education, and as so often it is the most disadvantaged pupils who risk being hardest hit. On Monday we will start to put this right - in a safe way - by reopening nurseries and other early years settings and reception, year one and year six in primary schools. A fortnight later on 15 June, secondary schools will begin to provide some face-to-face contact time for years 10 and 12. Secondly, we will also start to reopen shops as we restart our economy. We will begin, on Monday, with outdoor retail and car showrooms, where social distancing is generally easier. And a fortnight later on 15 June, we intend to reopen other non-essential retail - but only provided the five tests are still being met and shops have been made Covid secure. Lastly, I know the toll that lockdown has taken on families and friends who have been unable to see each other. So from Monday we will allow up to six people to meet outside - provided those from different households continue strictly to observe social distancing rules by staying two metres apart. At the moment, as you know, people can meet in parks but not in private gardens. This was a cautious first step - but we know that there is no difference in the health risk. So we will now allow people to meet in gardens and other private outdoor spaces. These changes mean friends and family can start to meet their loved ones - perhaps seeing both parents at once, or both grandparents at once. I know that for many this will be a long-awaited and joyful moment. But I must stress that to control the virus, everyone needs to stay alert, act responsibly, strictly observe social distancing rules, and stay two metres apart from those who you do not live with. Minimising contact with others is still the best way to prevent transmission. You should also try to avoid seeing people from too many households in quick succession - so that we can avoid the risk of quick transmission from lots of different families and continue to control the virus. And it remains the case that people should not be inside the homes of their friends and families, unless it is to access the garden. I should add that, at this stage, I am afraid that those who have been asked to shield themselves should continue to do so. I want to say to those extremely clinically vulnerable people who are being shielded that I do understand how difficult this has been for you, especially. And I want to thank you for all the efforts you have gone to - because your actions have helped the NHS to cope. We are looking carefully at how we can make your life easier, and how we can better support you, and we want to say more on that soon. I want to reassure everyone that we can make all of the changes I have outlined in a safe way. We know that children, and particularly young children, are much less likely to be seriously affected by the virus. We know that if shops enforce social distancing, as required by our Covid secure guidelines, then the virus is less likely to spread. And crucially, we know that transmission of the virus is far lower outdoors, so we can confidently allow more interaction outside. I understand people will have questions as to how to do all of this safely - and we will publish guidance on these changes to help people, to help you, make the most of them. Now inevitably, there may still be some anomalies, or apparent inconsistencies, in these rules. And clearly what we’re proposing is still just a fraction of the social interaction each of us would normally enjoy. I know many of you will find this frustrating - I am sorry about that. But I’m afraid it is unavoidable, given the nature of the invisible enemy we are fighting. It is a complex problem and we are asking for everyone’s patience as we work through it together. We will inevitably not get everything right first time. But I must ask everyone to remember it is that same patience, the hard work, and sacrifices of the British people in lockdown that have got us so far and allow us to make the progress we have. By protecting the NHS, getting us through the peak, and getting the virus under control - we are able to deliver all of the adjustments and easing of restrictions I have set out today. These adjustments are most of those we set out to achieve in step two of our roadmap, and we have also been able to have them in place by June 1 as we had hoped. There is no doubt that we are making progress and I am hopeful that in the coming weeks we may be able to do more. Because obviously while protecting the health and safety of the British public is, and must always be, our number one priority, we must also work to restart our economy and society - so as many people as possible can begin returning to their way of life. But I want to reaffirm that fundamental commitment to the British people that all the steps we have taken, and will take, are conditional. They are conditional on all the data, and all the scientific advice, and it is that scientific advice which will help us to judge what we are doing is safe. And I have to warn you, there will be further local outbreaks. So we will monitor carefully, we will put on the brakes as required, and where necessary, we will re-impose measures. It’s important to be clear about that up front. And as before, we will see how these new changes are working, and look at the R value and the number of new infections before taking any further steps, so we can ensure anything we do does not risk a second peak that could overwhelm the NHS. And yesterday, as I hope you all know, we took a huge step forward that will enable us to keep making progress in returning our lives to as close to normal as possible, while continuing to control the virus and isolate any new outbreaks. And that is through our new NHS Test and Trace programme in England. The Scottish Government has established Test and Protect, and Welsh and Northern Irish schemes will follow next week. And I’ll now show a short video that explains how NHS Test and Trace works in England and what we all need to do to play our part. Now I’ll hand over to Sir Patrick.",Prime Minister,Boris Johnson,https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/pm-press-conference-statement-on-the-five-tests-28-may-2020,,DEVELOPMENT
Russia,15-03-2004,Vladimir Putin,Speech at a Meeting with the Cabinet Members,"Good afternoon. Yesterday presidential elections took place, and this is what I would like to begin with. Once again, I would like to thank everyone who took part in the election. I must say that it was of great importance to me not just to obtain a positive result, but also to obtain a quality result in terms of voter turnout and the number of people who voted for the incumbent President, because it is this that confirms that our people really do support the policies we have pursued over the last four years. Without this support it would be difficult to work over the coming years. I would like once more to express my thanks to all those who supported me in this election.

At the same time, here, at this meeting with the government, I want to emphasise that the result of the elections is also a form of advance for me and for yourselves. The election results represent the hopes that voters have placed in us to carry out effective work together.

What I would like to say in this respect is that we often repeat the well-known phrase about the need to take so-called unpopular decisions. We should be taking not unpopular decisions, however, but necessary decisions. Is there anything so popular today in a housing and utilities system that is falling apart, in poor-quality health care or in problems in the education sector? There is nothing popular in this at all. We need to take clear, comprehensible, justified and carefully thought-out decisions in these and other sectors.

I am firmly convinced that no matter how market-oriented and tough these decisions might be, if they are justified and properly prepared, people will understand and support them. This is the kind of work I am asking you to do. This is the kind of work I want you to set your sights on. I very much hope that this work will be effective and will not be subjugated to ephemeral considerations of a historic nature, but will focus on improving the Russian people’s lives and making Russia a genuinely prosperous country in which people will see the tangible results of our work together over the coming years.

That is what I wanted to say for a start. Now let’s turn to today’s agenda, which is concerned with organising the government’s work. We are going to have to amend a number of laws in connection with the presidential decree on the government’s organisation. I know that the Deputy Prime Minister has been working on this, and I would like to hear your comments on this issue.",President,Vladimir Putin,http://en.kremlin.ru/events/president/transcripts/statements/22384,,OTHERS
USA,27-01-2015,Barack Obama,"
Remarks by President Obama in Address to the People of India","Namaste!  (Applause.)  Thank you so much.  Thank you so much, Neha, for what a wonderful introduction.  (Applause.)  Everybody, please have a seat.  Nothing fills me with more hope than when I hear incredible young people like Neha and all the outstanding work that she’s doing on behalf of India’s youth and for representing this nation’s energy and its optimism and its idealism.  She makes me very, very proud.  And I’m sure -- I think they may be her -- is that somebody related to you?  Okay.  Because we just had a chance to meet, and she’s beaming with pride right now sitting next to you.  Give Neha a big round of applause once again.  (Applause.)
 
Distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen, to all the students and young people who are here today, to the people of India watching and listening across this vast nation -- I bring the friendship and the greetings of the American people.  On behalf of myself and Michelle, thank you so much for welcoming us back to India.  Bahoot dhanyavad.  (Applause.)   
 
It has been a great honor to be the first American President to join you for Republic Day.  With the tricolor waving above us, we celebrated the strength of your constitution.  We paid tribute to India’s fallen heroes.  In yesterday’s parade, we saw the pride and the diversity of this nation -- including the Dare Devils on their Royal Enfields, which was very impressive.  Secret Service does not let me ride motorcycles.  (Laughter.)  Especially not on my head.  (Laughter.)
 
I realize that the sight of an American President as your chief guest on Republic Day would have once seemed unimaginable.  But my visit reflects the possibilities of a new moment.  As I’ve said many times, I believe that the relationship between India and the United States can be one of the defining partnerships of this century.  When I spoke to your Parliament on my last visit, I laid out my vision for how our two nations can build that partnership.  And today, I want to speak directly to you -- the people of India -- about what I believe we can achieve together, and how we can do it.
 
My commitment to a new chapter between our countries flows from the deep friendship between our people.  And Michelle and I have felt it ourselves.  I recognized India with the first state visit of my presidency -- where we also danced to some pretty good Bhangra.  (Laughter.)  For the first time, we brought Diwali to the White House.  (Applause.)  On our last celebration here, we celebrated the Festival of Lights in Mumbai.  We danced with some children.  Unfortunately, we were not able to schedule any dancing this visit.  Senorita, bade-bade deshon mein.  You know what I mean.  (Laughter and applause.)  Everybody said, by the way, how much better a dance Michelle was than me -- (laughter) -- which hurt my feelings a little bit.  (Laughter.)
 
On a more personal level, India represents an intersection of two men who have always inspired me.  When Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. was protesting racial segregation in the United States, he said that his guiding light was Mahatma Gandhi.  When Dr. King came to India, he said that being here -- in “Gandhi’s land” -- reaffirmed his conviction that in the struggle for justice and human dignity, the most potent weapon of all is non-violent resistance.   And those two great souls are why we can gather here together today, Indians and Americans, equal and free.
 
And there is another link that binds us.  More than 100 years ago, America welcomed a son of India -- Swami Vivekananda.  (Applause.)  And Swami Vivekananda, he helped bring Hinduism and yoga to our country.  And he came to my hometown of Chicago.  And there, at a great gathering of religious leaders, he spoke of his faith and the divinity in every soul, and the purity of love.  And he began his speech with a simple greeting:  “Sisters and brothers of America.”
 
So today, let me say:  Sisters and brothers of India -- (applause) -- my confidence in what our nations can achieve together is rooted in the values we share.  For we may have our different histories and speak different languages, but when we look at each other, we see a reflection of ourselves. 
 
Having thrown off colonialism, we created constitutions that began with the same three words -- “we the people.”  As societies that celebrate knowledge and innovation, we transformed ourselves into high-tech hubs of the global economy.  Together, we unlock new discoveries -- from the particles of creation to outer space -- two nations to have gone to both the Moon and to Mars.  (Applause.)  And here in India, this dynamism has resulted in a stunning achievement.  You’ve lifted countless millions from poverty and built one of the world’s largest middle classes.
 
And nobody embodies this progress and this sense of possibility more than our young people.  Empowered by technology, you are connecting and collaborating like never before -- on Facebook and WhatsApp and Twitter.  And chances are, you’re talking to someone in America -- your friends, your cousins.  The United States has the largest Indian diaspora in the world, including some three million proud Indian-Americans.  (Applause.)  And they make America stronger, and they tie us together -- bonds of family and friendship that allow us to share in each other’s success.
 
For all these reasons, India and the United States are not just natural partners.  I believe America can be India’s best partner.  I believe that.  (Applause.)  Of course, only Indians can decide India’s role in the world.  But I’m here because I’m absolutely convinced that both our peoples will have more jobs and opportunity, and our nations will be more secure, and the world will be a safer and a more just place when our two democracies -- the world’s largest democracy and the world’s oldest democracy -- stand together.  I believe that.  (Applause.) 
 
So here in New Delhi, Prime Minister Modi and I have begun this work anew.  And here’s what I think we can do together.  America wants to be your partner as you lift up the lives of the Indian people and provide greater opportunity.  So working together, we’re giving farmers new techniques and data -- from our satellites to their cell phones -- to increase yields and boost incomes.  We’re joining you in your effort to empower every Indian with a bank account. 
 
And with the breakthroughs we achieved on this visit, we can finally move toward fully implementing our civil nuclear agreement, which will mean more reliable electricity for Indians and cleaner, non-carbon energy that helps fight climate change.   (Applause.)  And I don’t have to describe for you what more electricity means.  Students being able to study at night; businesses being able to stay open longer and hire more workers; farmers being able to use mechanized tools that increase their productivity; whole communities seeing more prosperity.  In recent years, India has lifted more people out of poverty than any other country.  And now we have a historic opportunity with India leading the way to end the injustice of extreme poverty all around the world.  (Applause.)
 
America wants to be your partner as you protect the health of your people and the beauty of this land, from the backwaters of Kerala to the banks of Ganges.  As we deliver more energy, more electricity, let’s do it with clean, renewable energy, like solar and wind.  And let’s put cleaner vehicles on the road and more filtration systems on farms and villages.  Because every child should be able to drink clean water, and every child should be able to breathe clean air.  (Applause.)  We need our young people healthy for their futures.  And we can do it.  We have the technology to do it.
 
America wants to be your partner in igniting the next wave of Indian growth.  As India pursues more trade and investment, we want to be first in line.  We’re ready to join you in building new infrastructure -- the roads and the airports, the ports, the bullet trains to propel India into the future.  We’re ready to help design “smart cities” that serve citizens better, and we want to develop more advanced technologies with India, as we do with our closest allies.  
 
We believe we can be even closer partners in ensuring our mutual security.  And both our nations have known the anguish of terrorism, and we stand united in the defense of our people.  And now we’re deepening our defense cooperation against new challenges.  The United States welcomes a greater role for India in the Asia Pacific, where the freedom of navigation must be upheld and disputes must be resolved peacefully.  And even as we acknowledge the world as it is, we must never stop working for the world as it should be -- a world without nuclear weapons.  That should be a goal for all of us.  (Applause.)
 
I believe that if we’re going to be true global partners, then our two nations must do more around the world together.  So to ensure international security and peace, multilateral institutions created in the 20th century have to be updated for the 21st.  And that’s why I support a reformed United Nations Security Council that includes India as a permanent member.  (Applause.)   
 
Of course, as I’ve said before, with power comes responsibility.  In this region, India can play a positive role in helping countries forge a better future, from Burma to Sri Lanka, where today there’s new hope for democracy.  With your experience in elections, you can help other countries with theirs.  With your expertise in science and medicine, India can do more around the world to fight disease and develop new vaccines, and help us end the moral outrage of even a single child dying from a preventable disease.  Together, we can stand up against human trafficking and work to end the scourge of modern day slavery.  (Applause.)   
 
And being global partners means confronting the urgent global challenge of climate change.  With rising seas, melting Himalayan glaciers, more unpredictable monsoons, cyclones getting stronger -- few countries will be more affected by a warmer planet than India.  And the United States recognizes our part in creating this problem, so we’re leading the global effort to combat it.  And today, I can say that America’s carbon pollution is near its lowest level in almost two decades. 
 
I know the argument made by some that it’s unfair for countries like the United States to ask developing nations and emerging economies like India to reduce your dependence on the same fossil fuels that helped power our growth for more than a century.  But here’s the truth:  Even if countries like the United States curb our emissions, if countries that are growing rapidly like India -- with soaring energy needs -- don't also embrace cleaner fuels, then we don’t stand a chance against climate change.
 
So we welcome India’s ambitious targets for generating more clean energy.  We’ll continue to help India deal with the impacts of climate change -- because you shouldn’t have to bear that burden alone.  As we keep working for a strong global agreement on climate change, it's young people like you who have to speak up, so we can protect this planet for your generation.  I'll be gone when the worst effects happen.  It's your generation and your children that are going to be impacted.  That's why it's urgent that we begin this work right now.
 
Development that lifts up the lives and health of our people.  Trade and economic partnerships that reduce poverty and create opportunity.  Leadership in the world that defends our security, and advances human dignity, and protects our planet -- that’s what I believe India and America can do together.  So with the rest of my time, I want to discuss how we can do it.  Because in big and diverse societies like ours, progress ultimately depends on something more basic, and that is how we see each other.  And we know from experience what makes nations strong.
And Neha I think did a great job of describing the essence of what’s important here. 
 
We are strongest when we see the inherent dignity in every human being.  Look at our countries -- the incredible diversity even here in this hall.  India is defined by countless languages and dialects, and every color and caste and creed, gender and orientations.  And likewise, in America, we’re black and white, and Latino and Asian, and Indian-American, and Native American.  Your constitution begins with the pledge to uphold “the dignity of the individual.”  And our Declaration of Independence proclaims that “all men are created equal.”
 
In both our countries, generations have worked to live up to these ideals.  When he came to India, Martin Luther King, Jr. was introduced to some schoolchildren as a “fellow untouchable.”  My grandfather was a cook for the British army in Kenya.  The distant branches of Michelle’s family tree include both slaves and slave owners.  When we were born, people who looked like us still couldn’t vote in some parts of the country.  Even as America has blessed us with extraordinary opportunities, there were moments in my life where I’ve been treated differently because of the color of my skin. 
 
Many countries, including the United States, grapple with questions of identity and inequality, and how we treat each other, people who are different than us, how we deal with diversity of beliefs and of faiths.  Right now, in crowded neighborhoods not far from here, a man is driving an auto-rickshaw, or washing somebody else’s clothes, or doing the hard work no one else will do.  And a woman is cleaning somebody else’s house.  And a young man is on a bicycle delivering lunch. A little girl is hauling a heavy bucket of water.  And I believe their dreams, their hopes, are just as important, just as beautiful, just as worthy as ours.  And so even as we live in a world of terrible inequality, we’re also proud to live in countries where even the grandson of a cook can become President, or even a Dalit can help write a constitution, and even a tea seller can become Prime Minister.  (Applause.) 
 
The point is, is that the aim of our work must be not to just have a few do well, but to have everybody have a chance, everybody who is willing to work for it have the ability to dream big and then reach those dreams. 
 
Our nations are strongest when we uphold the equality of all our people -- and that includes our women.  (Applause.)  Now, you may have noticed, I’m married to a very strong and talented woman.  (Applause.)  Michelle is not afraid to speak her mind, or tell me when I’m wrong -- which happens frequently.  (Laughter.) And we have two beautiful daughters, so I’m surrounded by smart, strong women.  And in raising our girls, we’ve tried to instill in them basic values -- a sense of compassion for others, and respect for themselves, and the confidence that they can go as far as their imaginations and abilities will carry them.  And as part of Michelle’s work as First Lady, she’s met with women and girls around the world, including here in India, to let them know that America believes in them, too.
 
In the United States, we’re still working to make sure that women and girls have all the opportunities they deserve, and that they’re treated equally.  And we have some great role models, including here today the former speaker of our House of Representatives -- Nancy Pelosi -- (applause) -- the first woman speaker of the House, and my great partner.  (Applause.)
 
And here in India, it’s the wives and the mothers who so often hold families and communities together.  Indian women have shown that they can succeed in every field -- including government, where many of your leaders are women.  And the young women who are here today are part of a new generation that is making your voice heard, and standing up and determined to play your part in India’s progress.
 
And here’s what we know.  We know from experience that nations are more successful when their women are successful.  (Applause.)  When girls go to school -- this is one of the most direct measures of whether a nation is going to develop effectively is how it treats its women.  When a girl goes to school, it doesn’t just open up her young mind, it benefits all of us -- because maybe someday she’ll start her own business, or invent a new technology, or cure a disease.  And when women are able to work, families are healthier, and communities are wealthier, and entire countries are more prosperous.  And when young women are educated, then their children are going to be well educated and have more opportunity. 
 
So if nations really want to succeed in today’s global economy, they can’t simply ignore the talents of half their people.  And as husbands and fathers and brothers, we have to step up -- because every girl’s life matters.  Every daughter deserves the same chance as our sons.  Every woman should be able to go about her day -- to walk the streets or ride the bus -- and be safe, and be treated with respect and dignity.  (Applause.)  She deserves that.  (Applause.) 
   
And one of the favorite things about this trip for me has been to see all these incredible Indian women in the armed forces, including the person who commanded the Guard that greeted me when I arrived.  (Applause.)  It's remarkable, and it's a sign of great strength and great progress.
 
Our nations are strongest when we see that we are all God’s children -- all equal in His eyes and worthy of His love.  Across our two great countries we have Hindus and Muslims, Christians and Sikhs, and Jews and Buddhists and Jains and so many faiths.  And we remember the wisdom of Gandhiji, who said, “for me, the different religions are beautiful flowers from the same garden, or they are branches of the same majestic tree.”  (Applause.)    Branches of the same majestic tree.
 
Our freedom of religion is written into our founding documents.  It’s part of America’s very first amendment.  Your Article 25 says that all people are “equally entitled to freedom of conscience and the right freely to profess, practice and propagate religion.”  In both our countries -- in all countries
-- upholding this fundamental freedom is the responsibility of government, but it's also the responsibility of every person.
 
In our lives, Michelle and I have been strengthened by our Christian faith.  But there have been times where my faith has been questioned -- by people who don’t know me -- or they’ve said that I adhere to a different religion, as if that were somehow a bad thing.  Around the world, we’ve seen intolerance and violence and terror perpetrated by those who profess to be standing up for their faith, but, in fact, are betraying it.  No society is immune from the darkest impulses of man.  And too often religion has been used to tap into those darker impulses as opposed to the light of God.  Three years ago in our state of Wisconsin, back in the United States, a man went to a Sikh temple and, in a terrible act of violence, killed six innocent people -- Americans and Indians.  And in that moment of shared grief, our two countries reaffirmed a basic truth, as we must again today -- that every person has the right to practice their faith how they choose, or to practice no faith at all, and to do so free of persecution and fear and discrimination.  (Applause.) 
 
The peace we seek in the world begins in human hearts.  And it finds its glorious expression when we look beyond any differences in religion or tribe, and rejoice in the beauty of every soul.  And nowhere is that more important than India.  Nowhere is it going to be more necessary for that foundational value to be upheld.  India will succeed so long as it is not splintered along the lines of religious faith -- so long as it's not splintered along any lines -- and is unified as one nation.
And it’s when all Indians, whatever your faith, go to the movies and applaud actors like Shah Rukh Khan.  And when you celebrate athletes like Milkha Singh or Mary Kom.  And every Indian can take pride in the courage of a humanitarian who liberates boys and girls from forced labor and exploitation -- who is here today -- Kailash Satyarthi.  (Applause.)  Our most recent winner of the Nobel Prize for Peace.  (Applause.)
 
So that's what unifies us:  Do we act with compassion and empathy.  Are we measured by our efforts -- by what Dr. King called “the content of our character” rather than the color of our skin or the manner in which we worship our God.  In both our countries, in India and in America, our diversity is our strength.  And we have to guard against any efforts to divide ourselves along sectarian lines or any other lines.  And if we do that well, if America shows itself as an example of its diversity and yet the capacity to live together and work together in common effort, in common purpose; if India, as massive as it is, with so much diversity, so many differences is able to continually affirm its democracy, that is an example for every other country on Earth.  That's what makes us world leaders -- not just the size of our economy or the number of weapons we have, but our ability to show the way in how we work together, and how much respect we show each other.  

And, finally, our nations are strongest when we empower our young people –- because ultimately, you're the one who has to break down these old stereotypes and these old barriers, these old ways of thinking.  Prejudices and stereotypes and assumptions -- those are what happens to old minds like mine.  I'm getting gray hair now.  I was more youthful when I first started this office.  And that’s why young people are so important in these efforts.
 
Here in India, most people are under 35 years old.  And India is on track to become the world’s most populous country.  So young Indians like you aren’t just going to define the future of this nation, you’re going to shape the world.  Like young people everywhere, you want to get an education, and find a good job, and make your mark.  And it’s not easy, but in our two countries, it’s possible.
 
Remember, Michelle and I don't come from wealthy backgrounds or famous families.  Our families didn’t have a lot of money.  We did have parents and teachers and communities that cared about us.  And with the help of scholarships and student loans, we were able to attend some of best schools of the world.  Without that education, we wouldn’t be here today.  So whether it’s in America, or here in India, or around the world, we believe young people like you ought to have every chance to pursue your dreams, as well. 
 
So as India builds new community colleges, we’ll link you with our own, so more young people graduate with the skills and training to succeed.  We’ll increase collaborations between our colleges and universities, and help create the next India institute of technology.  We’ll encourage young entrepreneurs who want to start a business.  And we’ll increase exchanges, because I want more American students coming to India, and more Indian students coming to America.  (Applause.)  And that way, we can learn from each other and we can go further.  Because one other thing we have in common Indians and Americans are some of the hardest working people on Earth.  (Applause.) 
 
And I’ve seen that -- Michelle and I have seen that in a family here in India.  I just want to tell you a quick story.  On our last visit here, we visited Humayun’s Tomb.  And while we were there, we met some of the laborers who are the backbone of this nation’s progress.  We met their children and their families as well -- and some wonderful young children with bright smiles, sparks in their eyes.  And one of the children we met was a boy named Vishal.
 
And today, Vishal is 16 years old.  And he and his family live in South Delhi, in the village of Mor Band.  (Applause.)  And his mother works hard in their modest home, and his sister is now in university; she wants to become a teacher.  His brother is a construction worker earning his daily wage.  And his father works as a stone layer, farther away, but sends home what little he makes so Vishal can go to school.  And Vishal loves math, and mostly, he studies.  And when he’s not studying, he likes watching kabaddi.  And he dreams of someday joining the Indian armed forces.  (Applause.)  And we're grateful that Vishal and his family joined us today.  We're very proud of him, because he’s an example of the talent that’s here.  And Vishal’s dreams are as important as Malia and Sasha’s dreams, our daughters.  And we want him to have the same opportunities. 
 
Sisters and brothers of India, we are not perfect countries. And we’ve known tragedy and we've known triumph.  We’re home to glittering skyscrapers, but also terrible poverty; and new wealth, but also rising inequality.  We have many challenges in front of us.  But the reason I stand here today, and am so optimistic about our future together, is that, despite our imperfections, our two nations possess the keys to progress in the century ahead.  We vote in free elections.  We work and we build and we innovate.  We lift up the least among us.  We reach for heights previous generations could not even imagine.  We respect human rights and human dignity, and it is recorded in our constitutions.   And we keep striving to live up to those ideals put to paper all those years ago.
 
And we do these things because they make our lives better and safer and more prosperous.  But we also do them because our moral imaginations extend beyond the limits of our own lives.  And we believe that the circumstances of our birth need not dictate the arc of our lives.  We believe in the father working far from home sending money back so his family might have a better life.  We believe in the mother who goes without so that her children might have something more.  We believe in the laborer earning his daily wage, and the student pursuing her degree.  And we believe in a young boy who knows that if he just keeps studying, if he’s just given the chance, his hopes might be realized, too.
 
We are all “beautiful flowers from the same garden…branches of the same majestic tree.”  And I'm the first American President to come to your country twice, but I predict I will not be the last.  (Applause.)  Because, as Americans, we believe in the promise of India.  We believe in the people of India.  We are proud to be your friend.  We are proud to be your partner as you build the country of your dreams. 
 
Jai Hind!  (Applause.)  Thank you.

USA,21-03-2013,Barack Obama,"
Remarks of President Barack Obama To the People of Israel","Thank you.  (Applause.)  Thank you so much. Well, it is a great honor to be with you here in Jerusalem, and I’m so grateful for the welcome that I’ve received from the people of Israel.  Thank you.  (Applause.)  I bring with me the support of the American people -- (applause) -- and the friendship that binds us together.  (Applause.)
 
Over the last two days, I’ve reaffirmed the bonds between our countries with Prime Minister Netanyahu and President Peres. I’ve borne witness to the ancient history of the Jewish people at the Shrine of the Book, and I’ve seen Israel’s shining future in your scientists and your entrepreneurs.  This is a nation of museums and patents, timeless holy sites and ground-breaking innovation.  Only in Israel could you see the Dead Sea Scrolls and the place where the technology on board the Mars Rover originated at the same time.  (Applause.)

But what I’ve most looked forward to is the ability to speak directly to you, the Israeli people -- especially so many young people who are here today -- (applause) -- to talk about the history that brought us here today, and the future that you will make in the years to come.
 
Now, I know that in Israel’s vibrant democracy, every word, every gesture is carefully scrutinized.  (Laughter.)  But I want to clear something up just so you know -- any drama between me and my friend, Bibi, over the years was just a plot to create material for Eretz Nehederet.  (Applause.)  That’s the only thing that was going on.  We just wanted to make sure the writers had good material.  (Laughter.) 

I also know that I come to Israel on the eve of a sacred holiday -- the celebration of Passover.  And that is where I would like to begin today. 

Just a few days from now, Jews here in Israel and around the world will sit with family and friends at the Seder table, and celebrate with songs, wine and symbolic foods.  After enjoying Seders with family and friends in Chicago and on the campaign trail, I’m proud that I've now brought this tradition into the White House.  (Applause.)  I did so because I wanted my daughters to experience the Haggadah, and the story at the center of Passover that makes this time of year so powerful.
 
It’s a story of centuries of slavery, and years of wandering in the desert; a story of perseverance amidst persecution, and faith in God and the Torah.  It’s a story about finding freedom in your own land.  And for the Jewish people, this story is central to who you’ve become.  But it’s also a story that holds within it the universal human experience, with all of its suffering, but also all of its salvation.

It’s a part of the three great religions -- Judaism, Christianity, and Islam -- that trace their origins to Abraham, and see Jerusalem as sacred.  And it’s a story that’s inspired communities across the globe, including me and my fellow Americans.
 
In the United States -- a nation made up of people who crossed oceans to start anew -- we’re naturally drawn to the idea of finding freedom in our land.  To African Americans, the story of the Exodus was perhaps the central story, the most powerful image about emerging from the grip of bondage to reach for liberty and human dignity -- a tale that was carried from slavery through the Civil Rights Movement into today. 

For generations, this promise helped people weather poverty and persecution, while holding on to the hope that a better day was on the horizon.  For me, personally, growing up in far-flung parts of the world and without firm roots, the story spoke to a yearning within every human being for a home.  (Applause.)

Of course, even as we draw strength from the story of God’s will and His gift of freedom expressed on Passover, we also know that here on Earth we must bear our responsibilities in an imperfect world.  That means accepting our measure of sacrifice and struggle, just like previous generations.  It means us working through generation after generation on behalf of that ideal of freedom. 

As Dr. Martin Luther King said on the day before he was killed, “I may not get there with you.  But I want you to know that we, as a people, will get to the promised land.”  (Applause.)  So just as Joshua carried on after Moses, the work goes on for all of you, the Joshua Generation, for justice and dignity; for opportunity and freedom.
 
For the Jewish people, the journey to the promise of the State of Israel wound through countless generations.  It involved centuries of suffering and exile, prejudice and pogroms and even genocide.  Through it all, the Jewish people sustained their unique identity and traditions, as well as a longing to return home.  And while Jews achieved extraordinary success in many parts of the world, the dream of true freedom finally found its full expression in the Zionist idea -- to be a free people in your homeland.  That’s why I believe that Israel is rooted not just in history and tradition, but also in a simple and profound idea -- the idea that people deserve to be free in a land of their own.  (Applause.) 

Over the last 65 years, when Israel has been at its best, Israelis have demonstrated that responsibility does not end when you reach the promised land, it only begins.  And so Israel has been a refuge for the diaspora -- welcoming Jews from Europe, from the former Soviet Union, from Ethiopia, from North Africa.  (Applause.)
 
Israel has built a prosperous nation -- through kibbutzeem that made the desert bloom, business that broadened the middle class, innovators who reached new frontiers, from the smallest microchip to the orbits of space.  Israel has established a thriving democracy, with a spirited civil society and proud political parties, and a tireless free press, and a lively public debate -– “lively” may even be an understatement.  (Applause.)
 
And Israel has achieved all this even as it’s overcome relentless threats to its security -- through the courage of the Israel Defense Forces, and the citizenry that is so resilient in the face of terror.
 
This is the story of Israel.  This is the work that has brought the dreams of so many generations to life.  And every step of the way, Israel has built unbreakable bonds of friendship with my country, the United States of America.  (Applause.)
 
Those ties began only 11 minutes after Israeli independence, when the United States was the first nation to recognize the State of Israel.  (Applause.)  As President Truman said in explaining his decision to recognize Israel, he said, “I believe it has a glorious future before it not just as another sovereign nation, but as an embodiment of the great ideals of our civilization.”  And since then, we’ve built a friendship that advances our shared interests. 

Together, we share a commitment to security for our citizens and the stability of the Middle East and North Africa.  Together, we share a focus on advancing economic growth around the globe, and strengthening the middle class within our own countries.  Together, we share a stake in the success of democracy.
 
But the source of our friendship extends beyond mere interests, just as it has transcended political parties and individual leaders.  America is a nation of immigrants.  America is strengthened by diversity.  America is enriched by faith.  We are governed not simply by men and women, but by laws.  We're fueled by entrepreneurship and innovation, and we are defined by a democratic discourse that allows each generation to reimagine and renew our union once more.  So in Israel, we see values that we share, even as we recognize what makes us different.  That is an essential part of our bond. 
 
Now, I stand here today mindful that for both our nations, these are some complicated times.  We have difficult issues to work through within our own countries, and we face dangers and upheaval around the world.  And when I look at young people within the United States, I think about the choices that they must make in their lives to define who we'll be as a nation in this 21st century, particularly as we emerge from two wars and the worst recession since the Great Depression.  But part of the reason I like talking to young people is because no matter how great the challenges are, their idealism, their energy, their ambition always gives me hope.  (Applause.) 
 
And I see the same spirit in the young people here today.  (Applause.)  I believe that you will shape our future.  And given the ties between our countries, I believe your future is bound to ours.  (Audience interruption.)

  No, no -- this is part of the lively debate that we talked about.  (Applause.)  This is good.  You know, I have to say we actually arranged for that, because it made me feel at home.  (Laughter.)  I wouldn’t feel comfortable if I didn't have at least one heckler.  (Laughter.) 

I’d like to focus on how we -- and when I say ""we,"" in particular young people -- can work together to make progress in three areas that will define our times -- security, peace and prosperity.  (Applause.) 
 
Let me begin with security.  I'm proud that the security relationship between the United States and Israel has never been stronger.  Never.  (Applause.)  More exercises between our militaries; more exchanges among our political and military and intelligence officials than ever before; the largest program to date to help you retain your qualitative military edge.  These are the facts.  These aren't my opinions, these are facts.  But, to me, this is not simply measured on a balance sheet.  I know that here, in Israel, security is something personal.

Here's what I think about when I consider these issues.  When I consider Israel’s security, I think about children like Osher Twito, who I met in Sderot -- (applause) -- children the same age as my own daughters who went to bed at night fearful that a rocket would land in their bedroom simply because of who they are and where they live.  (Applause.)  

That reality is why we’ve invested in the Iron Dome system to save countless lives -- because those children deserve to sleep better at night.  (Applause.)  That’s why we’ve made it clear, time and again, that Israel cannot accept rocket attacks from Gaza, and we have stood up for Israel’s right to defend itself.  (Applause.)  And that’s why Israel has a right to expect Hamas to renounce violence and recognize Israel’s right to exist. (Applause.)
 
When I think about Israel’s security, I think about five Israelis who boarded a bus in Bulgaria, who were blown up because of where they came from; robbed of the ability to live, and love, and raise families.  That’s why every country that values justice should call Hizbollah what it truly is -- a terrorist organization.  (Applause.)  Because the world cannot tolerate an organization that murders innocent civilians, stockpiles rockets to shoot at cities, and supports the massacre of men and women and children in Syria right now.  (Applause.)

The fact that Hizbollah’s ally -- the Assad regime -- has stockpiles of chemical weapons only heightens the urgency.  We will continue to cooperate closely to guard against that danger. I’ve made it clear to Bashar al-Assad and all who follow his orders:  We will not tolerate the use of chemical weapons against the Syrian people, or the transfer of those weapons to terrorists.  The world is watching; we will hold you accountable. (Applause.) 

The Syrian people have the right to be freed from the grip of a dictator who would rather kill his own people than relinquish power.  (Applause.)  Assad must go so that Syria’s future can begin.  Because true stability in Syria depends upon establishing a government that is responsible to its people -- one that protects all communities within its borders, while making peace with countries beyond them.
 
These are the things I think about when I think about Israel’s security.  When I consider Israel’s security, I also think about a people who have a living memory of the Holocaust, faced with the prospect of a nuclear-armed Iranian government that has called for Israel’s destruction.  It’s no wonder Israelis view this as an existential threat.  But this is not simply a challenge for Israel -- it is a danger for the entire world, including the United States.  (Applause.)  A nuclear-armed Iran would raise the risk of nuclear terrorism.  It would undermine the non-proliferation regime.  It would spark an arms race in a volatile region.  And it would embolden a government that has shown no respect for the rights of its own people or the responsibilities of nations.
 
That’s why America has built a coalition to increase the cost to Iran of failing to meet their obligations.  The Iranian government is now under more pressure than ever before, and that pressure is increasing.  It is isolated.  Its economy is in dire straits.  Its leadership is divided.  And its position -- in the region, and the world -- has only grown weaker.  (Applause.)
 
I do believe that all of us have an interest in resolving this issue peacefully.  (Applause.)  Strong and principled diplomacy is the best way to ensure that the Iranian government forsakes nuclear weapons.  (Applause.)  Peace is far more preferable to war.  And the inevitable costs, the unintended consequences that would come with war means that we have to do everything we can to try to resolve this diplomatically.  Because of the cooperation between our governments, we know that there remains time to pursue a diplomatic resolution.  That’s what America will do, with clear eyes -- working with a world that’s united, and with the sense of urgency that’s required.
 
But Iran must know this time is not unlimited.  And I’ve made the position of the United States of America clear:  Iran must not get a nuclear weapon.  This is not a danger that can be contained, and as President, I’ve said all options are on the table for achieving our objectives.  America will do what we must to prevent a nuclear-armed Iran.  (Applause.)
 
For young Israelis, I know that these issues of security are rooted in an experience that is even more fundamental than the pressing threat of the day.  You live in a neighborhood where many of your neighbors have rejected the right of your nation to exist.  Your grandparents had to risk their lives and all that they had to make a place for themselves in this world.  Your parents lived through war after war to ensure the survival of the Jewish state.  Your children grow up knowing that people they’ve never met may hate them because of who they are, in a region that is full of turmoil and changing underneath your feet.
 
So that’s what I think about when Israel is faced with these challenges –- that sense of an Israel that is surrounded by many in this region who still reject it, and many in the world who refuse to accept it.  And that’s why the security of the Jewish people in Israel is so important.  It cannot be taken for granted. 

But make no mistake -- those who adhere to the ideology of rejecting Israel’s right to exist, they might as well reject the earth beneath them or the sky above, because Israel is not going anywhere.  (Applause.)  And today, I want to tell you -- particularly the young people -- so that there's no mistake here, so long as there is a United States of America -- Atem lo levad. You are not alone.  (Applause.)
 
The question is what kind of future Israel will look forward to.  Israel is not going anywhere -- but especially for the young people in this audience, the question is what does its future hold?  And that brings me to the subject of peace.  (Applause.) 

I know Israel has taken risks for peace.  Brave leaders -- Menachem Begin, Yitzhak Rabin -- reached treaties with two of your neighbors.  You made credible proposals to the Palestinians at Annapolis.  You withdrew from Gaza and Lebanon, and then faced terror and rockets.  Across the region, you’ve extended a hand of friendship and all too often you’ve been confronted with rejection and, in some cases, the ugly reality of anti-Semitism. So I believe that the Israeli people do want peace, and I also understand why too many Israelis -- maybe an increasing number, maybe a lot of young people here today -- are skeptical that it can be achieved.
 
But today, Israel is at a crossroads.  It can be tempting to put aside the frustrations and sacrifices that come with the pursuit of peace, particularly when Iron Dome repels rockets, barriers keep out suicide bombers.  There's so many other pressing issues that demand your attention.  And I know that only Israelis can make the fundamental decisions about your country’s future.  (Applause.)  I recognize that.

I also know, by the way, that not everyone in this hall will agree with what I have to say about peace.  I recognize that there are those who are not simply skeptical about peace, but question its underlying premise, have a different vision for Israel's future.  And that’s part of a democracy.  That's part of the discourse between our two countries.  I recognize that.  But I also believe it's important to be open and honest, especially with your friends.  I also believe that.  (Applause.)

Politically, given the strong bipartisan support for Israel in America, the easiest thing for me to do would be to put this issue aside -- just express unconditional support for whatever Israel decides to do -- that would be the easiest political path. But I want you to know that I speak to you as a friend who is deeply concerned and committed to your future, and I ask you to consider three points. 
 
First, peace is necessary.  (Applause.)  I believe that.  I believe that peace is the only path to true security.  (Applause.)  You have the opportunity to be the generation that permanently secures the Zionist dream, or you can face a growing challenge to its future.  Given the demographics west of the Jordan River, the only way for Israel to endure and thrive as a Jewish and democratic state is through the realization of an independent and viable Palestine.  (Applause.)  That is true. 

There are other factors involved.  Given the frustration in the international community about this conflict, Israel needs to reverse an undertow of isolation.  And given the march of technology, the only way to truly protect the Israeli people over the long term is through the absence of war.  Because no wall is high enough and no Iron Dome is strong enough or perfect enough to stop every enemy that is intent on doing so from inflicting harm.  (Applause.) 
 
And this truth is more pronounced given the changes sweeping the Arab world.  I understand that with the uncertainty in the region -- people in the streets, changes in leadership, the rise of non-secular parties in politics -- it's tempting to turn inward, because the situation outside of Israel seems so chaotic. But this is precisely the time to respond to the wave of revolution with a resolve and commitment for peace.  (Applause.) Because as more governments respond to popular will, the days when Israel could seek peace simply with a handful of autocratic leaders, those days are over.  Peace will have to be made among peoples, not just governments.  (Applause.) 

No one -- no single step can change overnight what lies in the hearts and minds of millions.  No single step is going to erase years of history and propaganda.  But progress with the Palestinians is a powerful way to begin, while sidelining extremists who thrive on conflict and thrive on division.  It would make a difference.  (Applause.)
 
So peace is necessary.  But peace is also just.  Peace is also just.  There is no question that Israel has faced Palestinian factions who turned to terror, leaders who missed historic opportunities.  That is all true.  And that’s why security must be at the center of any agreement.  And there is no question that the only path to peace is through negotiations -- which is why, despite the criticism we’ve received, the United States will oppose unilateral efforts to bypass negotiations through the United Nations.  It has to be done by the parties.  (Applause.)  But the Palestinian people’s right to self-determination, their right to justice, must also be recognized.  (Applause.) 

Put yourself in their shoes.  Look at the world through their eyes.  It is not fair that a Palestinian child cannot grow up in a state of their own.  (Applause.)  Living their entire lives with the presence of a foreign army that controls the movements not just of those young people but their parents, their grandparents, every single day.  It’s not just when settler violence against Palestinians goes unpunished.  (Applause.)  It’s not right to prevent Palestinians from farming their lands; or restricting a student’s ability to move around the West Bank; or displace Palestinian families from their homes.  (Applause.)  Neither occupation nor expulsion is the answer.  (Applause.)  Just as Israelis built a state in their homeland, Palestinians have a right to be a free people in their own land.  (Applause.)

I’m going off script here for a second, but before I came here, I met with a group of young Palestinians from the age of 15 to 22.  And talking to them, they weren’t that different from my daughters.  They weren’t that different from your daughters or sons.  I honestly believe that if any Israeli parent sat down with those kids, they’d say, I want these kids to succeed; I want them to prosper.  (Applause.)  I want them to have opportunities just like my kids do.  I believe that’s what Israeli parents would want for these kids if they had a chance to listen to them and talk to them.  (Applause.)  I believe that.

Now, only you can determine what kind of democracy you will have.  But remember that as you make these decisions, you will define not simply the future of your relationship with the Palestinians -- you will define the future of Israel as well.  (Applause.) 

As Ariel Sharon said -- I'm quoting him -- “It is impossible to have a Jewish democratic state, at the same time to control all of Eretz Israel.  If we insist on fulfilling the dream in its entirety, we are liable to lose it all.”  (Applause.)  Or, from a different perspective, I think of what the novelist David Grossman said shortly after losing his son, as he described the necessity of peace -- “A peace of no choice” he said, “must be approached with the same determination and creativity as one approaches a war of no choice.”  (Applause.)  

Now, Israel cannot be expected to negotiate with anyone who is dedicated to its destruction.  (Applause.)  But while I know you have had differences with the Palestinian Authority, I genuinely believe that you do have a true partner in President Abbas and Prime Minister Fayyad.  (Applause.)  I believe that.  And they have a track record to prove it.  Over the last few years, they have built institutions and maintained security on the West Bank in ways that few could have imagined just a few years ago.  So many Palestinians -- including young people -- have rejected violence as a means of achieving their aspirations.

There is an opportunity there, there’s a window -- which brings me to my third point:  Peace is possible.  It is possible. (Applause.)  I'm not saying it's guaranteed.  I can't even say that it is more likely than not.  But it is possible.  I know it doesn’t seem that way.  There are always going to be reasons to avoid risk.  There are costs for failure.  There will always be extremists who provide an excuse not to act. 

I know there must be something exhausting about endless talks about talks, and daily controversies, and just the grinding status quo.  And I'm sure there's a temptation just to say, “Ah, enough.  Let me focus on my small corner of the world and my family and my job and what I can control.”  But it's possible.

Negotiations will be necessary, but there's little secret about where they must lead -- two states for two peoples.  Two states for two peoples.  (Applause.)

There will be differences about how to get there.  There are going to be hard choices along the way.  Arab states must adapt to a world that has changed.  The days when they could condemn Israel to distract their people from a lack of opportunity, or government corruption or mismanagement -- those days need to be over.  (Applause.)  Now is the time for the Arab world to take steps toward normalizing relations with Israel.  (Applause.)
 
Meanwhile, Palestinians must recognize that Israel will be a Jewish state and that Israelis have the right to insist upon their security.  (Applause.)  Israelis must recognize that continued settlement activity is counterproductive to the cause of peace, and that an independent Palestine must be viable with real borders that have to be drawn.  (Applause.) 

I’ve suggested principles on territory and security that I believe can be the basis for these talks.  But for the moment, put aside the plans and the process.  I ask you, instead, to think about what can be done to build trust between people.
 
Four years ago, I stood in Cairo in front of an audience of young people -- politically, religiously, they must seem a world away.  But the things they want, they’re not so different from what the young people here want.  They want the ability to make their own decisions and to get an education, get a good job; to worship God in their own way; to get married; to raise a family. The same is true of those young Palestinians that I met with this morning.  The same is true for young Palestinians who yearn for a better life in Gaza. 
 
That's where peace begins -- not just in the plans of leaders, but in the hearts of people.  Not just in some carefully designed process, but in the daily connections -- that sense of empathy that takes place among those who live together in this land and in this sacred city of Jerusalem.  (Applause.) 

And let me say this as a politician -- I can promise you this, political leaders will never take risks if the people do not push them to take some risks.  You must create the change that you want to see.  (Applause.)  Ordinary people can accomplish extraordinary things.   

I know this is possible.  Look to the bridges being built in business and civil society by some of you here today.  Look at the young people who’ve not yet learned a reason to mistrust, or those young people who’ve learned to overcome a legacy of mistrust that they inherited from their parents, because they simply recognize that we hold more hopes in common than fears that drive us apart.  Your voices must be louder than those who would drown out hope.  Your hopes must light the way forward. 

Look to a future in which Jews and Muslims and Christians can all live in peace and greater prosperity in this Holy Land.  (Applause.)  Believe in that.  And most of all, look to the future that you want for your own children -- a future in which a Jewish, democratic, vibrant state is protected and accepted for this time and for all time.  (Applause.) 
 
There will be many who say this change is not possible, but remember this -- Israel is the most powerful country in this region.  Israel has the unshakeable support of the most powerful country in the world.  (Applause.)  Israel is not going anywhere. Israel has the wisdom to see the world as it is, but -- this is in your nature -- Israel also has the courage to see the world as it should be.  (Applause.) 

Ben Gurion once said, “In Israel, in order to be a realist you must believe in miracles.”  Sometimes, the greatest miracle is recognizing that the world can change.  That's a lesson that the world has learned from the Jewish people.
 
And that brings me to the final area that I'll focus on: prosperity, and Israel’s broader role in the world.  I know that all the talk about security and peace can sometimes seem to dominate the headlines, but that's not where people live.  And every day, even amidst the threats that you face, Israelis are defining themselves by the opportunities that you're creating.
Through talent and hard work, Israelis have put this small country at the forefront of the global economy. 

Israelis understand the value of education and have produced 10 Nobel laureates.  (Applause.)  Israelis understand the power of invention, and your universities educate engineers and inventors.  And that spirit has led to economic growth and human progress -- solar power and electric cars, bandages and prosthetic limbs that save lives, stem cell research and new drugs that treat disease, cell phones and computer technology that changed the way people around the world live. 

So if people want to see the future of the world economy, they should look at Tel Aviv, home to hundreds of start-ups and research centers.  (Applause.)  Israelis are so active on social media that every day seemed to bring a different Facebook campaign about where I should give this speech.  (Laughter and applause.)
 
That innovation is just as important to the relationship between the United States and Israel as our security cooperation. Our first free trade agreement in the world was reached with Israel, nearly three decades ago.  (Applause.)  Today the trade between our two countries is at $40 billion every year.  (Applause.)  More importantly, that partnership is creating new products and medical treatments; it’s pushing new frontiers of science and exploration.
 
That’s the kind of relationship that Israel should have -- and could have -- with every country in the world.  Already, we see how that innovation could reshape this region.  There’s a program here in Jerusalem that brings together young Israelis and Palestinians to learn vital skills in technology and business.  An Israeli and Palestinian have started a venture capital fund to finance Palestinian start-ups.  Over 100 high-tech companies have found a home on the West Bank -- which speaks to the talent and entrepreneurial spirit of the Palestinian people.

One of the great ironies of what’s happening in the broader region is that so much of what people are yearning for -- education, entrepreneurship, the ability to start a business without paying a bribe, the ability to connect to the global economy -- those are things that can be found here in Israel. This should be a hub for thriving regional trade, and an engine for opportunity.  (Applause.) 

Israel is already a center for innovation that helps power the global economy.  And I believe that all of that potential for prosperity can be enhanced with greater security, enhanced with lasting peace.  (Applause.)

Here, in this small strip of land that has been the center of so much of the world’s history, so much triumph and so much tragedy, Israelis have built something that few could have imagined 65 years ago.  Tomorrow, I will pay tribute to that history -- at the grave of Herzl, a man who had the foresight to see the future of the Jewish people had to be reconnected to their past; at the grave of Rabin, who understood that Israel’s victories in war had to be followed by the battles for peace; at Yad Vashem, where the world is reminded of the cloud of evil that can descend on the Jewish people and all of humanity if we ever fail to be vigilant.

We bear all that history on our shoulders.  We carry all that history in our hearts.  Today, as we face the twilight of Israel’s founding generation, you -- the young people of Israel
-- must now claim its future.  It falls to you to write the next chapter in the great story of this great nation.

And as the President of a country that you can count on as your greatest friend -- (applause) -- I am confident that you can help us find the promise in the days that lie ahead.  And as a man who’s been inspired in my own life by that timeless calling within the Jewish experience -- tikkun olam -- (applause) -- I am hopeful that we can draw upon what’s best in ourselves to meet the challenges that will come; to win the battles for peace in the wake of so much war; and to do the work of repairing this world.

USA,09-03-2021 00:00,Joe Biden,Statement by President Joe Biden on the House Taking Up the PRO Act,"I strongly encourage the House to pass the Protecting the Right to Organize (PRO) Act of 2021, which would dramatically enhance the power of workers to organize and collectively bargain for better wages, benefits, and working conditions.

As America works to recover from the devastating challenges of deadly pandemic, an economic crisis, and reckoning on race that reveals deep disparities, we need to summon a new wave of worker power to create an economy that works for everyone.  We owe it not only to those who have put in a lifetime of work, but to the next generation of workers who have only known an America of rising inequality and shrinking opportunity. All of us deserve to enjoy America’s promise in full — and our nation’s leaders have a responsibility to deliver it.

That starts with rebuilding unions. The middle class built this country, and unions built the middle class. Unions give workers a stronger voice to increase wages, improve the quality of jobs and protect job security, protect against racial and all other forms of discrimination and sexual harassment, and protect workers’ health, safety, and benefits in the workplace.  Unions lift up workers, both union and non-union.  They are critical to strengthening our economic competitiveness.

But, after generations of sweat and sacrifice, fighting hard to earn the wages and benefits that built and sustained the American middle class, unions are under siege. Nearly 60 million Americans would join a union if they get a chance, but too many employers and states prevent them from doing so through anti-union attacks. They know that without unions, they can run the table on workers – union and non-union alike.

We should all remember that the National Labor Relations Act didn’t just say that we shouldn’t hamstring unions or merely tolerate them. It said that we should encourage unions. The PRO Act would take critical steps to help restore this intent.

I urge Congress to send the PRO Act to my desk so we can seize the opportunity to build a future that reflects working people’s courage and ambition, and offers not only good jobs with a real choice to join a union — but the dignity, equity, shared prosperity and common purpose the hardworking people who built this country and make it run deserve.",President,Joe Biden,https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/03/09/statement-by-president-joe-biden-on-the-house-taking-up-the-pro-act/,,DEVELOPMENT
Russia,09-11-2002 00:00,Vladimir Putin,Speech at a Meeting of the Heads of Security and Military Agencies,"Today, on September 11, as the world speaks about and remembers last year’s tragedy in the US and the thousands of innocent people who died in the terrorist attacks, and we in Russia remember the hundreds of our fellow countrymen who became the victims of terrorists as a result of bombings and other crimes, it is particularly appropriate and timely to have another look at the situation in the national security sphere. For a long time the source of extremism and terrorism in our country has been the Chechen Republic where international terrorist organisations, including notorious al-Qaeda, unfolded their activities on a full scale.

Of course, there are still many outstanding political and social problems in Chechnya today. The terrorists are still able to be active and deliver hit-and-run strikes. But their units have suffered a powerful and tangible blow. All the infrastructures of international terrorism there have been destroyed.

One of the things that complicates the effective fight against terrorism is the survival of enclaves in some parts of the world that are not under national governmental control because for various reasons the governments are unable or unwilling to confront the terrorist threat.

One such place where the situation is causing particular concern to Russia is the Pankisi Gorge and other places along the state border between Georgia and Russia. The situation in that region has for a long time been poisoning our relations with Georgia, with whose people we have not only a shared history and moral values, but a feeling of mutual sympathy and respect. Had it been otherwise hundreds of thousands of Georgians wouldn’t be living and working here permanently, in practically all the regions of Russia.

Starting in 1999, we offered the Georgian Government to participate in joint actions to prevent Chechen militants from infiltrating into Georgia. Russia has been persistently and patiently trying to establish interaction with Tbilisi’s authorities on the issues of the fight against terrorism. During that period the views and approaches of our Georgian colleagues have significantly changed: from the total and flat denial of the presence of international terrorists on their territory to the total and unqualified admission of that fact.

Today, no one can deny, and we know for sure, and that is confirmed by foreign information sources, that Georgian territory has been chosen as a haven by those who were complicit in planning the terrorist attacks in the US a year ago and those who blew up houses in the Russian Federation. We demand their immediate extradition. But Georgia refuses to extradite not only these people, but even the terrorists who have been detained by the Georgian authorities after their failed attempt to cross the border into Russia in late July of this year.

We have also patiently awaited the results of the so-called anti-criminal operation.

The presence of hundreds of terrorists and illegal armed groups on Georgian territory, which include, by the way, citizens of various countries, is not denied. The need to carry out special operations to restore order is recognised. But no terrorists have been stopped, no militants have been detained and put on trial or extradited or at least deported from Georgia. The legitimate question arises: where are they?

The answer is known: they have spread out to other regions of Georgia along the border with Russia and are preparing to commit new crimes.

Russia firmly adheres to its international obligations and respects the sovereignty and integrity of other states, but it expects to be treated in a similar way.

If the Georgian leadership is unable to create a security zone in the area of the Georgian-Russia border, continues to ignore the UN Security Council Resolution 1373 of September 28, 2001, and does not put an end to the terrorist groups and their attacks on the neighbouring regions of Russia, we reserve the right to proceed in accordance with Article 51 of the UN Charter which gives every UN member state the inalienable right to individual or collective self-defence.

In connection with this, I ask the Director of the Federal Border Service, the Defence Minister and the Director of the FSB to report back on the execution of my previous directives on the strengthening of the southern borders of Russia. I ask you to work out and propose measures for additional protection of the state border. The Defence Ministry jointly with the other security agencies is to submit proposals on planned special operations to eliminate the units of militants if terrorists try again to break through into our territory.

I ask the General Staff to submit proposals on the feasibility of delivering strikes on known terrorist bases in the course of hot pursuit.

The Foreign Ministry will be instructed to convey our concerns about Georgia’s violation of the counter-terrorist resolutions of the UN Security Council to the Secretary General of that organisation, the permanent Security Council members and our partners in the counter-terrorist coalition.

I will also ask the speakers of the two houses of the Federal Assembly to carry out the relevant work with parliaments, above all as part of inter-parliamentary links with Georgia.

I very much hope that we will be able to work out concrete joint measures to combat terrorism at our forthcoming meeting with the Georgian President Eduard Shevardnadze in Chisinau in early October of this year.

And the last thing. None of the above will be needed, no measures or special operations will be needed if the Georgian leadership really controls its own territory, abides by its international obligations in the fight against international terrorism and prevents possible attacks being launched by international terrorists from its territory against the territory of the Russian Federation.",President,Vladimir Putin,http://en.kremlin.ru/events/president/transcripts/statements/21717,,EXTREMISM
Russia,26-03-2004,Vladimir Putin,Speech at the Public Forum of the People of the Caucasus and Southern Russia,"Good afternoon, dear friends,

I am really very happy to see you here at this forum, which represents so broadly all the regions of the Caucasus and the south of Russia.

Gathered here today are people of many ethnic groups and religions, people of different ages and professions. You have come here today to look for new approaches to strengthening harmony and solidarity among everyone in the region. Solidarity has always been the main prerequisite for development in this region. Without it, it is very difficult to achieve anything in general, and in regions like the Caucasus it is practically impossible. That is something I particularly want to emphasise. I want to add too, that this kind of cooperation is the result of efforts made by all citizens and all peoples living here, all those who strive for peace and prosperity in their own lands and in their country, all who want to be proud of the Caucasus and proud of Russia.

Over recent years, through our common efforts we have managed to stabilise the situation in the North Caucasus. We have achieved this stabilisation in a region that has suffered the most acute and dramatic manifestations of all the conflicts that emerged in the post-Soviet period.

Today, the situation has changed fundamentally. Armed confrontation and conflict are now becoming a thing of the past. In Chechnya, the most complicated region, peace is becoming irreversible. This means that we have managed to preserve our country’s territorial integrity, protect the constitutional rights of our citizens and create opportunities for economic growth.

All of this is of the utmost importance for the successful development of Southern Russia. Without economic development we all know that we will not be able to resolve cultural, religious or interethnic problems. Without it, Russian and foreign investors will remain unwilling to put their money into developing the south of the country. This makes achieving serious economic growth a fundamental task for all the regions in the Southern Federal District.

I must admit that the federal authorities in Moscow have not always paid sufficient attention to economic issues here, but I think that the heads of the southern regions will also agree that the regions themselves did not always work effectively over the past years, either to attract investment or to put in place conditions for developing business and creating new jobs.

Of course, there was a time when this was all understandable and explainable. Today, however, there should be no place for saying that the North Caucasus is a dangerous and unattractive region for investors. This region is like any other region in Russia, and in some ways it has even more advantages – geopolitical, natural and climatic advantages. There are immense opportunities here for creating small businesses, developing transport corridors, agriculture, health resorts and tourism. It is our common obligation to use these advantages to turn the south of Russia and the North Caucasus into a flourishing land and a major economic and cultural centre.

Today more than ever we need the political will of the regional authorities and the initiative of citizens, businesspeople and the entire public. We need you to come up with bold new approaches and develop viable economic projects. Of course, the importance of broad cooperation between your regions cannon be emphasised enough. This includes developing and expanding business ties, both within the southern region and with the communities of Caucasus peoples in other parts of the country and abroad. The foundation for stability in the region, to a large extent, lies in having strong economic ties between peoples, including with the Trans-Caucasus countries, ties developed through trans-border cooperation, business contacts, cultural and social contacts and through fostering trust and good-neighbourliness.

I am sure that all these efforts will meet the people’s support. Hard work has always been respected in Southern Russia. The main thing is to open up new opportunities for people to realise their potential and pursue their goals. People here are very active and all we need is to create the right conditions.

Dear friends,

The North Caucasus is a major centre of diverse but united Russian spiritual culture. Any attempts to break this unity have always met with resistance, including from the Caucasus peoples themselves. We can see this by looking not just at events from long ago but also at recent examples from our history. Let’s just remember the events in Dagestan in 1999. The people of Russia and the peoples of the Caucasus share a common destiny.

Here at this forum, which has brought together both older generations and young people, I would like to recall Imam Shamil’s testament to his sons. He called upon them to remain loyal to the Russian state and to live in peace and harmony with its peoples.

This is why the efforts of traditional Islamic spiritual leaders are now particularly important. Their authority and the truth of their words are a bulwark against attempts to impose alien, extremist ideas upon the Caucasus peoples, ideas that are an attempt to pervert Islam and use it for selfish and aggressive purposes, for profit. It is very important that the cooperation that has built up here over the centuries is developing and receiving every kind of support, the cooperation between Christianity and our other traditional religions.

I want to add here that for Russia, the Caucasus is not just another region, and this is well known throughout our country. There is a special fondness for the nature of the Caucasus. The Caucasus and its history is something close to us all right from our time as schoolchildren.

We need to preserve and care for these feelings and relations. Whether preserving local customs and traditions or helping to build a new life, a great deal depends on you, the participants in this forum, and on the position you take and your willingness to enter into dialogue. Much also depends, of course, on the work that scholars, writers and people working in the cultural sphere do to educate the population.

In conclusion, I want to say once again that you live in a unique region that brings together many cultures and religions, and where a large number of peoples live side by side. Researchers were so astonished by the number of peoples here that they called the Caucasus “the mountain of languages”.

People of different faiths have lived in the south of Russia since ancient times and this has enriched their spiritual world. I would like to note the efforts made by all the religions represented in this region to support constructive interregional and interethnic dialogue.

Mutual understanding, assistance and friendship have always been the foundation of stability. There is no doubt that only people themselves can strengthen this foundation.

I wish you all success and prosperity. I am sure that together we can make this region peaceful and flourishing.",President,Vladimir Putin,http://en.kremlin.ru/events/president/transcripts/statements/22396,,OTHERS
USA,28-08-2021 00:00,Joe Biden,Statement by President Joe Biden on the Evacuation Mission in Kabul,"This morning, I met with my national security team in Washington and my commanders in the field. We discussed the strike that U.S. forces took last night against the terrorist group ISIS-K in Afghanistan. I said we would go after the group responsible for the attack on our troops and innocent civilians in Kabul, and we have. This strike was not the last. We will continue to hunt down any person involved in that heinous attack and make them pay. Whenever anyone seeks to harm the United States or attack our troops, we will respond. That will never be in doubt. I thanked General McKenzie for his leadership of that mission, and for his commitment to the safety of our troops in Afghanistan.

The situation on the ground continues to be extremely dangerous, and the threat of terrorist attacks on the airport remains high. Our commanders informed me that an attack is highly likely in the next 24-36 hours. I directed them to take every possible measure to prioritize force protection, and ensured that they have all the authorities, resources and plans to protect our men and women on the ground. They assured me that they did, and that they could take these measures while completing the mission and safely retrograding our personnel.

Despite the treacherous situation in Kabul, we are continuing to evacuate civilians. Yesterday, we brought out another 6,800 people, including hundreds of Americans. And today, we discussed the ongoing preparations to help people continue to leave Afghanistan after our military departs.

The 13 service members that we lost were heroes who made the ultimate sacrifice in service of our highest American ideals and while saving the lives of others. Their bravery and selflessness has enabled more than 117,000 people at risk to reach safety thus far. May God protect our troops and all those standing watch in these dangerous days.",President,Joe Biden,https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/08/28/statement-by-president-joe-biden-on-the-evacuation-mission-in-kabul/,,INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS
USA,09-04-2021 00:00,Joe Biden,Remarks by President Biden on the Weekly Economic Briefing,"THE PRESIDENT:  Well, first of all, Jill and I, and the entire administration, send our condolences to Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II on the loss of Prince Philip.  He was a heck of a guy. 

He — you know, he was — in his lifetime of service to the United Kingdom and the whole Commonwealth was visible to everybody for a long, long time, and his bravery serving in World War II, as well as his being a champion of the environment, as well as the charity — the charitable things he set up.

So we really do express our condolences for an extraordinary life that was led by the Prince.  And I think he’s going to be missed, particularly in the United Kingdom.  Ninety-nine years old and he never slowed down at all, and — which I admire the devil out of.

And today, we’re meeting on — we’re having an economic briefing here with the team.  I sent to Congress my funding priorities for the appropriations process, including two key public health initiatives that I’m pushing.

The first is — like DARPA in the Defense Department, which was designed to develop, and has developed, breakthroughs to protect us and enhance our physical safety — I’m proposing a $6.5 billion appropriation for what we call “ARPA-H,” which is focused on going to — focused on health issues. 

This is a pioneering breakthrough that we hope we can detect and treat and prevent diseases like Alzheimer’s and diabetes, and give us a chance to end cancer as we know it, because we’ll focus exclusively on those items.

And secondly, I’m proposing a historic funding increase of 50 percent up to — of $4 billion to end the opioid crisis, which still ravages the country and has taken so many lives over the last two years; resources both to the states and to Tribes for treatment, as well as prevention. 

That also includes the single-largest funding increase ever for Title I schools — schools for disadvantaged schools — to lift up the millions of children in low-income families.  And it’ll put them in a position where all the data is — we’ve –I’ve talked a lot about this — the data shows that it puts a child from a household that is a lower-income household in a position, if they start school — not daycare, but school — at three and four years old, there’s overwhelming evidence that they are able to compete all the way through high school and beyond. 

And so it doubles the funding as well for — for VAWA services, including resources to end the rape kit backlog.  We’ve been working on this for a long, long time, and we still have a backlog on the rape kit.  And — and the point is: A significant number of women who have been raped — and the person has not been found or convicted is because they’re sitting in jail.  The average rapist rapes about six times. 

And so, out there, we’re — we want to make sure we go through this backlog and find out, to bring some — some certitude to — for the woman who is saying, “No, no, it was true.  That’s the man.  He did it.”  And it changes the whole perspective — all the hearings we held on that. 

And also there — it makes major investments in the fight against climate change. 

And there’s issues that are personal to millions of Americans in the area of VAWA, because I get that asked, and we get spoken to by everyone from mayors and governors, local officials of both parties. 

So I look forward to working with Congress to advance these and other priorities.  I think we’re going to be able to get — I’m hoping we will have some bipartisan support across the board.  I’ve already spoken to some of my Republican colleagues about dealing with the infrastructure legislation we have up there, as well as other budget items.  So we’re going to work on seeing if we can get some bipartisan support across the board here. 

But that’s what we’re about to do now.  We’re going to talk about our economic priorities, and we’ll get the brief from the team here.  But thank you all for coming.",President,Joe Biden,https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/speeches-remarks/2021/04/09/remarks-by-president-biden-on-the-weekly-economic-briefing/,,DEVELOPMENT
USA,29-09-2015,Barack Obama,"
Remarks by President Obama at the Leaders' Summit on Countering ISIL and Violent Extremism","Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, heads of state and government.  Last year, here at the United Nations, I called on the world to unite against the evil that is ISIL, or Daesh, and to eradicate the scourge of violent extremism.  And I challenged countries to return to the General Assembly this year with concrete steps that we can take together.  

I want to thank everyone who is here today, including my fellow leaders, for answering this call.  We are joined by representatives from more than 100 nations, more than 20 multilateral institutions, some 120 civil society groups from around the world, and partners from the private sector.  I believe what we have here today is the emergence of a global movement that is united by the mission of degrading and ultimately destroying ISIL.  

Together, we’re pursuing a comprehensive strategy that is informed by our success over many years in crippling the al Qaeda core in the tribal regions of Afghanistan and Pakistan.  And we are harnessing all of our tools -- military, intelligence, economic, development and the strength of our communities.  

Now, I have repeatedly said that our approach will take time.  This is not an easy task.  We have ISIL taking root in areas that already are suffering from failed governance, in some cases; in some cases, civil war or sectarian strife.  And as a consequence of the vacuum that exists in many of these areas, ISIL has been able to dig in.  They have shown themselves to be resilient, and they are very effective through social media and have been able to attract adherents not just from the areas in which they operate, but in many of our own countries.

There are going to be successes and there are going to be setbacks.  This is not a conventional battle.  This is a long-term campaign -- not only against this particular network, but against its ideology.  And so with the few minutes I have, I want to provide a brief overview of where we stand currently.

Our coalition has grown to some 60 nations, including our Arab partners.  Together, we welcome three new countries to our coalition -- Nigeria, Tunisia and Malaysia.  Nearly two dozen nations are in some way contributing to the military campaign, and we salute and are grateful for all the servicemembers from our respective nations who are performing with skill and determination.

In Iraq, ISIL continues to hold Mosul, Fallujah and Ramadi.  But Iraqi forces, backed by coalition air power, have liberated towns across Kirkuk province and Tikrit.  ISIL has now lost nearly a third of the populated areas in Iraq that it had controlled.  Eighteen countries are now helping to train and support Iraqi forces, including Sunni volunteers who want to push ISIL out of their communities.  And, Prime Minister Abadi, I want to note the enormous sacrifices being made by Iraqi forces and the Iraqi people in this fight every day.  

In Syria, which has obviously been a topic of significant discussion during the course of this General Assembly, we have seen support from Turkey that has allowed us to intensify our air campaign there.  ISIL has been pushed back from large sections of northeastern Syria, including the key city of Tal Abyad, putting new pressure on its stronghold of Raqqa.  And ISIL has been cut off from almost the entire region bordering Turkey, which is a critical step toward stemming the flow of foreign terrorist fighters. 

Following the special Security Council meeting I chaired last year, more than 20 additional countries have passed or strengthened laws to disrupt the flow of foreign terrorist fighters.  We share more information and we are strengthening border controls.  We’ve prevented would-be fighters from reaching the battlefield and returning to threaten our countries.  But this remains a very difficult challenge, and today we’re going to focus on how we can do more together.  In conjunction with this summit, the United States and our partners are also taking new steps to crack down on the illicit finance that ISIL uses to pay its fighters, fund its operations and launch attacks.

Our military and intelligence efforts are not going to succeed alone; they have to be matched by political and economic progress to address the conditions that ISIL has exploited in order to take root.  Prime Minister Abadi is taking important steps to build a more inclusive and accountable government, while working to stabilize areas taken back from ISIL.  And our nations need to help Prime Minister Abadi in these efforts.

In Syria, as I said yesterday, defeating ISIL requires -- I believe -- a new leader and an inclusive government that unites the Syrian people in the fight against terrorist groups.  This is going to be a complex process.  And as I’ve said before, we are prepared to work with all countries, including Russia and Iran, to find a political mechanism in which it is possible to begin a transition process.

As ISIL’s tentacles reach into other regions, the United States is increasing our counterterrorism cooperation with partners, like Tunisia.  We’re boosting our support to Nigeria and its neighbors as they push back against Boko Haram, which has pledged allegiance to ISIL.  And we’re creating a new clearinghouse to better coordinate the world’s support for countries’ counterterrorism programs so that our efforts are as effective as possible. 

Ultimately, however, it is not going to be enough to defeat ISIL in the battlefield.  We have to prevent it from radicalizing, recruiting and inspiring others to violence in the first place.  And this means defeating their ideology.  Ideologies are not defeated with guns, they’re defeated by better ideas -- a more attractive and compelling vision.  Building on our White House summit earlier this year, and summits around the world since then, we’re moving ahead, together, in several areas.  

We’re stepping up our efforts to discredit ISIL’s propaganda, especially online.  The UAE’s new messaging hub -- the Sawab Center -- is exposing ISIL for what it is, which is a band of terrorists that kills innocent Muslim men, women and children.  We’re working to lift up the voices of Muslim scholars, clerics and others -- including ISIL defectors -- who courageously stand up to ISIL and its warped interpretations of Islam.

We recognize that we have to confront the economic grievances that exist in some of the areas that ISIL seeks to exploit.  Poverty does not cause terrorism.  But as we’ve seen across the Middle East and North Africa, when people, especially young people, are impoverished and hopeless and feel humiliated by injustice and corruption, that can fuel resentments that terrorists exploit.  Which is why sustainable development -- creating opportunity and dignity, particularly for youth -- is part of countering violent extremism.

We recognize we also have to address the political grievances that ISIL exploits.  I’ve said this before -- when human rights are denied and citizens have no opportunity to redress their grievances peacefully, it feeds terrorist propaganda that justifies violence.  Likewise, when political opponents are treated like terrorists and thrown in jail, it can be a self-fulfilling prophecy.  So the real path to lasting stability and progress is not less democracy; I believe it is more democracy in terms of free speech, and freedom of religion, rule of law, strong civil societies.  All that has to play a part in countering violent extremism.  

And finally, we recognize that our best partners in protecting vulnerable people from succumbing to violent extremist ideologies are the communities themselves -- families, friends, neighbors, clerics, faith leaders who love and care for these young people.

Remember that violent extremism is not unique to any one faith, so no one should be profiled or targeted simply because of their faith.  Yet we have to recognize that ISIL is targeting Muslim communities around the world, especially individuals who may be disillusioned or confused or wrestling with their identities.  

And in all our countries, we have to continue to build true partnerships with Muslim communities, based on trust and cooperation, so that they can help protect their loved ones from becoming radicalized.  This cannot just be the work of government.  It is up to all of us.  We have to commit ourselves to build diverse, tolerant, inclusive societies that reject anti-Muslim and anti-immigrant bigotry that creates the divisions, the fear and the resentments upon which extremists can prey.  

I’m pleased that here at this summit, businesses -- including high-tech companies -- are investing funds, training and technological expertise to support innovative programs that push back on violent extremism.  Cities around the world are joining together to build more resilient communities.  Researchers are partnering to share best practices, knowing what works and what we can do better.  

And as we saw yesterday, young people from around the world are participating in their own summit.  These young people, many of them Muslim, are coming together and using their talents and technology to push back on ISIL’s propaganda, especially online, and to protect their brothers and sisters from recruitment.  These young people are an inspiration and give us hope, and I’d ask everyone to join me in thanking all the young people who are here today.  (Applause.)    

So, to conclude, we face a grave challenge.  We have to be clear-eyed about the fact that this is very hard work.  We have individuals here, like Prime Minister Abadi and President Buhari, who are on the front lines.  And this is not going to be turned around overnight, because it is not just a military campaign that we are involved in.  There are profound changes taking place in the Middle East and North Africa.  There are problems that have built over decades that are expressing themselves and manifesting themselves in organizations like ISIL.  Even if we were to wipe out the entire cadre of ISIL leadership, we would still have some of these forces at work.

But, ultimately, I am optimistic.  In Iraq and in Syria, ISIL is surrounded by communities, countries and a broad international coalition committed to its destruction.  We’ve seen that ISIL can be defeated on the battlefield, where there is sound organization and a government and military that is coordinating with this coalition and with our diplomatic efforts.  And here at this summit, we’re seeing a new global movement to counter the violent extremism that ISIL needs to survive.  

Like terrorists and tyrants throughout history, ISIL will eventually lose because it has nothing to offer but suffering and death.  And when you look at the reports of those who are laboring under their control, it is a stark and brutal life that does not appeal to people over the long term.  So we will ultimately prevail because we are guided by a stronger, better vision:  a commitment to the security, opportunity and dignity of every human being.  But it will require diligence, focus and sustained effort by all of us.  And I am grateful that all of you who are already participating are committed to this work.

With that, I want to give the floor to our Secretary-General, His Excellency Mr. Ban Ki-moon.  (Applause.)",President,Barack Obama,https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/the-press-office/2015/09/29/remarks-president-obama-leaders-summit-countering-isil-and-violent,,INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS

Statement by the President on Airstrikes in Syria","Good morning, everybody.  Last night, on my orders, America’s armed forces began strikes against ISIL targets in Syria.  Today, the American people give thanks for the extraordinary service of our men and women in uniform, including the pilots who flew these missions with the courage and professionalism that we've come to expect from the finest military that the world has ever known.

Earlier this month, I outlined for the American people our strategy to confront the threat posed by the terrorist group known as ISIL.  I made clear that as part of this campaign the United States would take action against targets in both Iraq and Syria so that these terrorists can't find safe haven anywhere.  I also made clear that America would act as part of a broad coalition.  And that's exactly what we've done.

We were joined in this action by our friends and partners -- Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Jordan, Bahrain, and Qatar.  America is proud to stand shoulder to shoulder with these nations on behalf of our common security. 

The strength of this coalition makes it clear to the world that this is not America’s fight alone.  Above all, the people and governments in the Middle East are rejecting ISIL and standing up for the peace and security that the people of the region and the world deserve. 

Meanwhile, we will move forward with our plans, supported by bipartisan majorities in Congress, to ramp up our effort to train and equip the Syrian opposition, who are the best counterweight to ISIL and the Assad regime.  And more broadly, over 40 nations have offered to help in this comprehensive effort to confront this terrorist threat -- to take out terrorist targets; to train and equip Iraqi and Syrian opposition fighters who are going up against ISIL on the ground; to cut off ISIL’s financing; to counter its hateful ideology; and to stop the flow of fighters into and out of the region.

Last night, we also took strikes to disrupt plotting against the United States and our allies by seasoned al Qaeda operatives in Syria who are known as the Khorasan Group.  And once again, it must be clear to anyone who would plot against America and try to do Americans harm that we will not tolerate safe havens for terrorists who threaten our people. 

I've spoken to leaders in Congress and I'm pleased that there is bipartisan support for the actions we are taking.  America is always stronger when we stand united, and that unity sends a powerful message to the world that we will do what’s necessary to defend our country.

Over the next several days I will have the opportunity to meet with Prime Minister Abadi of Iraq, and with friends and allies at the United Nations to continue building support for the coalition that is confronting this serious threat to our peace and security.  The overall effort will take time.  There will be challenges ahead.  But we're going to do what’s necessary to take the fight to this terrorist group, for the security of the country and the region and for the entire world.

Remarks by the President at 60th Anniversary of the Korean War Armistice"," Thank you so much.  (Applause.)  Thank you.  Please be seated.  Good morning.  Annyong haseyo. 

Secretaries Hagel, Jewell and Shinseki; Admiral Winnefeld; General Jung; all our friends from the Republic of Korea, including the legendary General Paik Sun Yup; distinguished guests; and most of all, veterans of the Korean War and your families.  (Applause.)  To our veterans -- many in your 80s, a few in your old uniforms -- which still fit -- (laughter) -- let me just say you look outstanding.  And I would ask that all United States, Republic of Korea, and other veterans who fought  -- I would ask those who can stand to please stand so that we can properly honor you here today.  (Applause.)    

July 27th, 1953 -- 60 years ago today.  In the village of Panmunjom, in a barren room, the generals picked up their pens and signed their names to the agreement spread before them.  That night, as the armistice took hold, the guns of war thundered no more.  Along the jagged front, men emerged from their muddy trenches.  A Marine raised his bugle and played taps.  And a soldier spoke for millions when he said, “Thank God it is over.”

In the days that followed, both sides pulled back, leaving a demilitarized zone between them.  Soldiers emptied their sandbags and tore down their bunkers.  Our POWs emerged from the camps.  Our troops boarded ships and steamed back across the ocean.  And describing the moment he passed under the Golden Gate Bridge, one of those soldiers wrote, “We suddenly knew we had survived the war, and we were home.”

Yet ask these veterans here today and many will tell you, compared to other wars, theirs was a different kind of homecoming.  Unlike the Second World War, Korea did not galvanize our country.  These veterans did not return to parades.  Unlike Vietnam, Korea did not tear at our country.  These veterans did not return to protests.  Among many Americans, tired of war, there was, it seemed, a desire to forget, to move on.  As one of these veterans recalls, “We just came home and took off our uniforms and went to work.  That was about it.”  

You, our veterans of Korea, deserved better.  And down the decades, our nation has worked to right that wrong, including here, with this eternal memorial, where the measure of your sacrifice is enshrined for all time.  Because here in America, no war should ever be forgotten, and no veteran should ever be overlooked.  And after the armistice, a reporter wrote, “When men talk in some distant time with faint remembrance of the Korean War, the shining deeds will live.”  The shining deeds will live. 

On this 60th anniversary, perhaps the highest tribute we can offer our veterans of Korea is to do what should have been done the day you come home.  In our hurried lives, let us pause.  Let us listen.  Let these veterans carry us back to the days of their youth, and let us be awed by their shining deeds.

Listen closely and hear the story of a generation -- veterans of World War II recalled to duty.  Husbands kissing their wives goodbye yet again.  Young men -- some just boys, 18, 19, 20 years old -- leaving behind everyone they loved “to defend a country they never knew and a people they never met.”  Let’s never forget all the daughters who left home, especially our heroic nurses who saved so many.  Our women in Korea also served with honor.  They also gave their lives.  (Applause.)

Listen, and hear how these Americans faced down their fears and did their duty.  Clutching their rifles; hearing the bugles in the distance; knowing that waves of enemy fighters would soon be upon them.  In ships offshore, climbing down the ropes into the landing craft, knowing some of them would not leave that beach.  On the tarmacs and flight decks, taking off in their Corsairs and Sabres, knowing that they might not return to this earth.

Listen, and hear of their gallantry -- often outnumbered and outgunned -- in some of the most brutal combat in modern history. How they held the line at the Pusan Perimeter.  How they landed at Inchon and turned the tide of the war.  How, surrounded and freezing, they battled their way out of Chosin Reservoir.  And how they fought -- foxhole by foxhole, mountain after mountain, day and night -- at the Punchbowl and Heartbreak Ridge, Old Baldy and Pork Chop Hill.

Listen, and hear how perhaps the only thing worse than the enemy was the weather.  The searing heat, the choking dust of summer.  The deep snow and bitter cold of winter -- so cold their weapons could jam; so cold their food would turn to ice.  And surely no one endured more than our POWs in those hellish camps, where the torment was unimaginable.  Our POWs from Korea are some of the strongest men our nation has ever produced, and today we honor them all -- those who never came home and those who are here today.  (Applause.)

Listen to these veterans and you’ll also hear of the resilience of the human spirit.  There was compassion -- starving prisoners who shared their food.  There was love -- men who charged machine guns, and reached for grenades, so their brothers might live.  There was the dark humor of war -- as when someone misunderstood the code name for mortar rounds -- “Tootsie Rolls” -- and then shipped our troops thousands of Tootsie Rolls --  candies.

And there was hope -- as told in a letter home written by a soldier in the 7th Cavalry.  Marching through the snow and ice, something caught his eye -- a young lieutenant up ahead, and from the muzzle of his rifle hung a pair of tiny baby booties, “swinging silently in the wind…like tiny bells.”  They were sent by the lieutenant’s wife, pregnant with their first child, and she promised to send ribbons -- blue if a boy, pink if a girl.  But as the war ground on, those soldiers were scattered.  Until one day, on a Korean road, he spotted the lieutenant again.  “Swinging gaily in the first rays of the morning sun,” the soldier wrote, were those booties, “and fluttering below them was the brightest, bluest piece of ribbon I have ever seen.”

Six decades on, these moments may seem like faint remembrances of a distant time.  But for you -- our Korea veterans and your families -- I know it must feel sometimes just like just yesterday.  And on days such as this, you’re back there once more.  For Korea was the fire that helped to forge you. 

As we listen to the story of your service, I say let us also learn, because your lives hold lessons for us today.  Korea taught us the perils when we fail to prepare.  After the Second World War, a rapid drawdown left our troops underequipped, so that in the early days of Korea, their rockets literally bounced off enemy tanks.  Today, as we end a decade of war and reorient our forces for the future, as we make hard choices at home, our allies and adversaries must know the United States of America will maintain the strongest military the world has ever known, bar none, always.  That is what we do.  (Applause.)

Korea taught us that, as a people, we are stronger when we stand as one.  On President Truman’s orders, our troops served together in integrated units.  And the heroism of African Americans in Korea -- and Latinos and Asian Americans and Native Americans -- advanced the idea:  If these Americans could live and work together over there, surely we could do the same thing here at home.  (Applause.) 

Change came slowly.  And we continue our long journey toward a more perfect union.  But for the great strides we have made toward the ideals of equality and opportunity, we must give thanks to our Korean War veterans who helped point the way.

Korea reminds us that when we send our troops into battle, they deserve the support and gratitude of the American people -- especially when they come home.  Today, let us remember that -- right now -- our sons and daughters continue to risk their lives, give their lives, in Afghanistan.  And as this war ends and we welcome them home, we will make it our mission to give them the respect and the care and the opportunities that they have earned. (Applause.) 

And Korea reminds us that our obligations to our fallen and their families endure long after the battle ends.  To this day, 7,910 Americans are still missing from the Korean War.  And we will not stop working until we give these families a full accounting of their loved ones.  (Applause.)  Like Sergeant First Class William Robinson -- 26 years old -- missing for 63 years.  This week, in Indiantown Gap, Pennsylvania, the Robinsons will welcome their uncle home and finally lay him to rest -- with full military honors.  (Applause.)     

Freedom is not free.  And in Korea, no one paid a heavier price than those who gave all -- 36,574 American patriots, and, among our allies, more than one million of our South Korean friends -- soldiers and civilians.  That July day, when the fighting finally ended, not far from where it began, some suggested this sacrifice had been for naught, and they summed it up with a phrase -- “die for a tie.” 

It took many decades for this memorial to gain its rightful place on this great Mall where we tell our American story.  It has, perhaps, taken even longer to see clearly, and understand fully, the true legacy of your service.  But here, today, we can say with confidence that war was no tie.  Korea was a victory.  When 50 million South Koreans live in freedom -- a vibrant democracy, one of the world’s most dynamic economies, in stark contrast to the repression and poverty of the North -- that’s a victory; that’s your legacy.  (Applause.)

When our soldiers stand firm along the DMZ; when our South Korean friends can go about their lives, knowing that the commitment of the United States to the security of the Republic of Korea will never waver -- that is a victory, and that is your legacy.

When our allies across the Asia Pacific know -- as we have proven in Korea for 60 straight years -- that the United States will remain a force for peace and security and prosperity --that’s a victory; that’s your legacy.

And for generations to come, when history recalls how free nations banded together in a long Cold War, and how we won that war, let it be said that Korea was the first battle -- where freedom held its ground and free peoples refused to yield, that, too, is your victory, your legacy.

Most of all, your legacy burns brightest right here, in a grateful nation that reveres you; in the loving families that cherish you -- like that young soldier with those baby booties swinging from his rifle.  Ever since the war, the story of that soldier has been passed among our Korean War vets.  Some of you may have heard it before.  And many may have wondered what became of that soldier.  Today, six decades later, we now know -- because we found him.  His was Richard Shank, from St. Louis, Missouri.  For his valor in Korea he earned the Silver Star.  Yes, Dick survived the war.  He returned home.  He held his baby boy in his arms.  He was able to be a father to his son. 

But this story doesn’t end there -- because like so many of you, Dick continued to serve in uniform.  His son grew into a man, got married, had children of his own.  Those children are now adults themselves, scattered across the country.  And like so many American families, they still speak with pride of their grandfather’s service in Korea.    

Today, Dick Shank lives in Gainesville, Florida, and I believe he’s watching us this morning.  He’s 84 years old, recovering from a recent fall while roller skating.  (Laughter.) “Life is short,” he says, “and I just keep on living it.”  And one of the ways he keeps living it is by meeting up every year with his buddies from Korea, and recalling the time they shared together in that fight which ended 60 years ago today.

Veterans of the Korean War -- in the spring of your youth you learned how short and precious life can be.  And because of you, millions of people can keep on living it, in freedom and in peace.  Your lives are an inspiration.  Your service will never be forgotten.  You have the thanks of a grateful nation.  And your shining deeds will live -- now and forever. 

May God bless those who gave all in Korea.  May God bless you and your families.  May God bless the alliances that helped secure our prosperity and our security.  And may God continue to bless these United States of America.  Thank you very much.

Remarks by President Obama Before a Meeting with Central and Eastern European Leaders","Well, thank you very much.  Good afternoon. And along with President Komorowski, I’m very pleased to welcome our outstanding allies from across Central and Eastern Europe.  We have done this before in Prague and on my last visit to Warsaw.  And I want to thank my fellow leaders for being here.

As the President indicated, this 25th anniversary of Polish freedom reminds us of the transformation that’s taken place all across the region.  The countries represented here have all undertaken hard reforms, have built democratic institutions, have delivered greater prosperity for their citizens, and underlying this progress is the security guarantee that comes from NATO membership.  We’re here today because as NATO allies we have to stand absolutely united in our Article 5 commitments to collective defense.  We stand together always. 

And as I’ve said throughout the day and previously back home, I continue to believe that NATO is the cornerstone foundation of U.S. security, not just European security.  Now, given Russia’s actions in Ukraine, NATO has increased its presence across the region from the Baltic to the Black Sea.  I thank our allies for the contributions they’re making, and I’ll be discussing the initiative that I announced today to bolster the U.S. presence in Europe. 

A number of countries represented here have already committed to increasing their investments in our collective defense, and today we’ll be discussing additional steps that we can take both as individual nations and as an alliance to make sure we have the capabilities that we need.  I expect that we’ll also have an opportunity to discuss how Europe, especially Central and Eastern Europe, can continue to diversify its energy sources.  The United States will be exporting more natural gas to the global market in the years to come.  But more immediately, there are steps that we can take together to reduce energy risks, upgrade our energy infrastructure and improve efficiency. 

So, again, I want to thank our fellow leaders for being here today.  I think their presence sends a powerful message that as NATO allies, we stand as one.  Citizens across Central and Eastern Europe need to know that what you’ve built over the last 25 years no other nation can take away. 

So, again, thank you, President Komorowski, for your hospitality.  And I think once the press clears the room, we can get the meeting started.

Weekly Address: Upholding the Legacy of Those We Lost on September 11th"," Fifteen years ago, a September day that began like any other became one of the darkest in our nation’s history. The Twin Towers were reduced to rubble. The Pentagon was in flames. A Pennsylvania field burned with the wreckage of an airplane. And nearly 3,000 innocent lives were lost. Sons and daughters, husbands and wives, neighbors and colleagues and friends. They were from all walks of life, all races and religions, all colors and creeds, from across America and around the world.

This weekend, we honor their memory once more. We stand with the survivors who still bear the scars of that day. We thank the first responders who risked everything to save others. And we salute a generation of Americans—our men and women in uniform, diplomats and our intelligence, homeland security and law enforcement professionals -- who serve, and have given their lives, to help keep us safe.

A lot has changed over these past 15 years. We’ve delivered devastating blows to the al Qaeda leaders that attacked us on 9/11. We delivered justice to Osama bin Laden. We’ve strengthened our homeland security. We’ve prevented attacks. We’ve saved lives.

At the same time, the terrorist threat has evolved, as we’ve seen so tragically from Boston to Chattanooga, from San Bernardino to Orlando. So in Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria and beyond, we’ll stay relentless against terrorists like al Qaeda and ISIL. We will destroy them. And we’ll keep doing everything in our power to protect our homeland.

As we reflect on these past 15 years, it’s also important to remember what has not changed—the core values that define us as Americans. The resilience that sustains us. After all, terrorists will never be able to defeat the United States. Their only hope is to terrorize us into changing who we are or our way of life. That’s why we Americans will never give in to fear. And it’s why this weekend we remember the true spirit of 9/11. We’re still the America of heroes who ran into harm’s way; of ordinary folks who took down the hijackers; of families who turned their pain into hope. We are still the America that looks out for one another, bound by our shared belief that I am my brother’s keeper, I am my sister’s keeper. /p>

In the face of terrorism, how we respond matters. We cannot give in to those who would divide us. We cannot react in ways that erode the fabric of our society. Because it’s our diversity, our welcoming of all talent, our treating of everybody fairly—no matter their race, gender, ethnicity, or faith—that’s part of what makes our country great. It’s what makes us resilient. And if we stay true to those values, we’ll uphold the legacy of those we’ve lost, and keep our nation strong and free. God bless you, and God bless the United States of America.",President,Barack Obama,https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/the-press-office/2016/09/10/weekly-address-upholding-legacy-those-we-lost-september-11th,,OTHERS
Russia,22-10-2019,Vladimir Putin,Press statement following Russian-Turkish talks,"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen,

We thank the President of Turkey for accepting our offer made during a recent telephone conversation, and today he and representatives of his delegation arrived in Sochi to discuss the developments in the Syrian Arab Republic, including in the northeast, beyond the Euphrates.

Mr Erdogan gave a detailed explanation of the goals of the Turkish military operation along the Syrian border. We have noted many times that we understand Turkey’s desire to take measures that would guarantee its national security.

We share Turkey’s concerns about the growing threat of terrorism and ethnic and religious disputes in that region. We believe these disputes and separatist sentiments have been fueled artificially from the outside.

It is important to prevent members of terrorist organisations, such as ISIS, whose militants have been taken prisoners by Kurd military groups and try to break free, from taking advantage of the actions of the Turkish military units.

Syria must be liberated from illegal foreign military presence. We believe that the only way to achieve strong and long-lasting stability in Syria is to respect the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the country. This is our principled position, and we have discussed it with the President of Turkey.

It is important that our Turkish partners share this approach. The Turks and the Syrians will have to protect peace on the border together, which would be impossible without mutually respectful cooperation between the two countries.

In addition to this, a broad dialogue between the Syrian government and the Kurds living in northeastern Syria must be launched. It is clear that all the rights and interests of the Kurds as an integral part of the multi-ethnic Syrian nation can only be fully considered and fulfilled via such an inclusive dialogue.

Of course, during our talks with the President of Turkey, we discussed further steps to promote the peaceful political process in Syria, which the Syrians will conduct within the Constitutional Committee in cooperation with the United Nations.

The guarantors of the Astana format have meticulously worked on it for many years.

We believe the situation on the ground must not prevent the long-awaited launch of the committee in Geneva next week – October 29–30.

Naturally, we also discussed humanitarian issues. We consider it necessary to continue helping Syrian refugees to return home, which will substantially alleviate the socioeconomic burden shouldered by the countries that agreed to take in Syrians. First and foremost this applies to the Republic of Turkey.

We urge the international community, primarily relevant UN agencies, to be more active in rendering humanitarian aid to all Syrians going home, without any discrimination, politicisation and preconditions. We also used today’s meeting to discuss current bilateral issues.

We noted with satisfaction our growing trade. Last year it increased by 16 percent. We exchanged views on what to do in the near future and expressed confidence that the implementation of the agreements on settlements and payments in national currencies signed in early October will also facilitate the further growth of trade.

We spoke about an important document that provides not only for more active use of the ruble and lira but also broader acceptance of the Russian Mir cards in Turkey and the connection of Turkish banks and companies to the Bank of Russia’s financial messaging system. I believe this is yet another step forward on expanding tourist exchanges.

We spoke about the whole package of our relations, including major projects that we are actively and successfully developing. We are also deepening our military-technical cooperation. I would like to note that cross-years of culture and tourism are held with success in Russia and Turkey.

In conclusion, I would like to thank the President of Turkey and all our friends and colleagues for a business-like and sincere conversation. We intend to further develop our cooperation in all areas on the principles of neighbourliness and respect for each other’s interests.

I am pleased to say that as a result of lengthy and intensive work we managed to make decisions that the foreign ministers of our countries will voice after our statements.

I think these decisions are very important, if not historic, and will allow us to settle the fairly acute situation on the Syrian-Turkish border. ",President,Vladimir Putin,http://en.kremlin.ru/events/president/transcripts/statements/61876,,INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS
USA,28-05-2019 00:00,Donald Trump,Remarks by President Trump Aboard the JS Kaga,"PRESIDENT TRUMP:  Well, thank you very much.  And I want to start by saying Happy Memorial Day.  Happy Memorial Day.  It’s a great day.

Thank you very much.  And, you know, we had a tremendous couple of days with the Prime Minister.  He’s a great gentleman, great leader.  And I just want to say that our First Lady and I are very honored to be here today on the JS Kaga.  That’s a great ship.  They love this ship.  You all love the ship, right?  You feel good about it, don’t you?  I do too.  I feel very safe on this.

And I’m honored to be with my friend, the Prime Minister, and Mrs. Abe, and the extraordinary men and women of the United States Navy’s Seventh Fleet and the Japanese Maritime Self-Defense Forces.

It was a great honor last night and this morning to meet and greet your new Emperor and Empress — two very, very special people.  Spectacular.  And we got to know them, and they’re going to do a tremendous job for Japan.  Going to make you very proud.

On behalf of the First Lady and myself, I want to take a moment to send our prayers and sympathy to the victims of the stabbing attack this morning in Tokyo.  All Americans stand with the people of Japan and grieve for the victims and for their families.

Our thanks to Ambassador Hagerty, Mrs. Hagerty, Vice Admiral Phil Sawyer, and Rear Admiral Gregory Fenton for joining us today.   Thank you very much.  Thank you.

My thanks as well to Admiral Hiroshi Yamamura and also to Captain Hideki Mizuta, who commands this magnificent ship, for joining us today.  Thank you very much.  I appreciate it.

At this very historic moment, as Japan begins Reiwa and the Reiwa era, we celebrate the U.S.-Japan alliance and the friendship between our freedom-loving peoples.

Our armed forces train and serve together around the world, including right here.  Very special.  In fact, this is the only port in the world where an American naval fleet and an allied naval fleet are headquartered side-by-side.  The American and Japanese sailors stationed in this bay are living testaments to the enduring power of our incredible partnership.

As you know, Japan recently announced its intent to purchase 105 brand new, stealth F-35 fighter aircraft.  The best in the world.  This purchase would give Japan the largest fleet of F-35s of any of our allies.  And soon, this very ship will be upgraded to carry that cutting-edge aircraft.  With this extraordinary new equipment, the JS Kaga will help our nations defend against a range of complex threats in the region and far beyond.

I want to thank my friend and your Prime Minister — he’s an extraordinary man — for his commitment to improving Japan’s defense capabilities, which also advances the security of the United States of America.

And to all of the incredible American and Japanese service members here today, it has been a true privilege to visit with you.  On behalf of all Americans, we extend our deep gratitude for everything you do to safeguard our people.

Again, thank you.  God bless you all.  Thank you very much.  Thank you.",President,Donald Trump,https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefings-statements/remarks-president-trump-aboard-js-kaga/,,INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS
Russia,21-12-2006,Vladimir Putin,Speech at the Council of Legislators Session,"Good afternoon dear colleagues!

Issues that you will discuss today have a key strategic value for our country and society. I am referring to the most important demographic problems whose resolution will, without any undue exaggeration, determine Russia’s future. And it is obvious that the executive and legislative authorities – in this case the authorities in the Russian regions – play a major role here.

You are aware that, unfortunately, over the past 13 years the Russian population has steadily decreased. Over these years the number of people that passed away exceeded the number of people who were born by 11,2 million people. And one other disturbing demographic indicator is the speed at which the country is ageing. The share of people over 65 amounts to 13,7 percent of the population. This number is almost two times more than the international standard which classifies a given society as old.

In Russia today for every 1,000 workers there are 276 children and 323 retirees. Therefore you can count who works: about 600 people – 599 people. Along with this I would point out that the overall reduction in the workforce is also caused by the high death rate.

We must break out of these negative tendencies and do so based on a systematic and well-designed policy in this sphere.

As you know, certain urgent measures have already been taken in this sphere and today Dmitrii Anatolevich Medvedev, the person responsible for the national projects, will tell us about how they are being implemented. I will comment on the major areas in which teamwork should take place.

First – we must create the necessary conditions for increasing the birth rate. And I am not only referring to the population’s reproduction levels but also to comprehensive support for the family and increasing the family’s authority in Russian society.

I will tell you downright that in this respect a great deal depends not only on material factors but also on moral beliefs, on the status that family values hold among values as a whole. And our task is to support and elevate the family institution in every possible way, to increase the prestige of parenthood. Every level of authority must pay critical attention to these issues. It is obvious that these problems can be resolved more effectively on location. Since it is precisely here where people live, resolve their social problems and create families.

I also consider that the system of grants and privileges which will already start operating in 2007 is certainly a powerful one, but it is only a supplement to family incomes. We must go further and create all necessary conditions so that parents can receive worthy salaries. In Russia there should not only be more children – they also need to be healthier, both morally and physically. They must receive the necessary education, upbringing and, in the future, worthy jobs.

I shall emphasise once again that to a large degree the tasks of creating new work places, the development of small businesses, the creation of a free business climate and improving citizens’ quality of life as a whole, lie with the regional and municipal authorities. Resolving all these problems has a direct relationship with establishing the conditions for demographic development.

The next issue that we will discuss today is how to reduce the high death rate. As we have already said, and said more than once, the death of people of working age remains a difficult problem. And 90 percent of these people are men. And what is especially disturbing is that the group at risk is essentially composed of youth. The reasons for these so-called superfluous deaths are well-known. The most common is problems with the cardiovascular system. The second group of reasons are the so-called unnatural or external factors: road and transport accidents, alcohol poisoning, crimes.

It is obvious that the conditions people live in and their way of life acts as a key factor in the death rate. And, for that reason, when developing regional demographic programmes one must not only consider improving the level of health care but also developing a system of leisure, promoting physical education, sport and improving working conditions.

Alcoholism has a special place among these problems. Experts consider that a significant number of deaths that could be prevented are connected with alcohol abuse.

I believe that we will discuss all these themes today in a very detailed way.

The third area within our demographic policy must be the competent management of migration flows. I would like to say at once that the need Russia has for inflows of people from other countries remains very high. It is precisely these people that we can count on to accomplish the short-term task of renewing the population. Along with this one must consider that while in 1992 migration practically replaced the decline in Russia’s population, it only did so by 12,7 percent in 2005.

Therefore attracting our compatriots abroad to Russia remains one of our important tasks. You are aware that in June we adopted the corresponding programme that concerns the voluntary resettlement of compatriots to Russia and that in 2007 twelve Russian regions will give those who wish to return to their historic Motherland the possibility to do so. And the further destiny of this programme directly depends on how this work will be accomplished.

I consider that the pilot programmes in the Russian regions and the municipalities will provide immigrants with all-around support. This includes with respect to their initial living arrangements, with work permits, pension and medical security, as well as providing children with preschool and school education.

I would like to emphasise the value of competent and delicate work designed to integrate immigrants into their environments. Along with this is it is important to ensure a balance between the rights and legitimate interests of Russian citizens and those of immigrants.

And finally several words about labour migration that is not helping resolve the demographic problem but rather using up external labour to resolve the problem of shortages in labour resources. I shall remind you that as of the 15th of January the regime by which people can receive work permits for Russia will be significantly simplified, especially for citizens from CIS countries. It is well-known that excessive administrative procedures promoted the growth of illegal migration and the development of corruption. But nevertheless I would like to emphasise that along with the regime being simplified the responsibility of employers will be significantly increased, both with respect to the legal status of their foreign employees and the conditions in which they work.

I should also note that since 1 January 2007 the major functions with respect to employment and also concerning putting forward proposals on labour migration will be transferred to the regions. Of course the responsibility for executing these powers goes along with this.

I should admit that we tried to determine how many immigrants, migrants, and temporary residents we need on Russian territory. And it is with regret that I must say that we cannot even determine this figure. And it is revealing that there are still no well-developed contacts between regions, municipal authorities, federal authorities, employers, business and national enterprises, in this sphere.

Dear colleagues! The task of the federal authorities in resolving demographic problems consists in establishing common rules and norms as well as providing guarantees and supporting the measures that have been taken with the necessary financial resources. And you and your colleagues from the local government bodies should inform people about the content of the documents that have been accepted and supplement them with your own supportive measures – not by merely adding red tape to this process.

Moreover, you should develop your own regional strategy for resolving demographic problems – a strategy that takes into account regional specifics, traditions and particularities. You probably already have proposals concerning the methodological, personnel, and organisational support required for demographic programmes. I very much expect that today you will be able to fruitfully discuss all these issues and also formulate your proposals in such a way that they reach the federal level and are studied by the federal authorities. And thereby we will finally have a uniform state policy in this important area in which we cooperate.

Thank you for your attention.

Thank you very much.",President,Vladimir Putin,http://en.kremlin.ru/events/president/transcripts/statements/23968,,OTHERS
United Kingdom,11-Jun-10,David Cameron,PM’s speech at Camp Bastion,"Transcript of speech given by the Prime Minister David Cameron at Camp Bastion on 11 June 2010. Read the transcript: Brigadier: Good morning, troops. I am absolutely delighted that the Prime Minister has been able to come out here to join us, so thank you very much for coming and we very much look forward to hearing what you have to say. Prime Minister: Thank you very much, Brigadier, and good morning, everyone. Thank you very much for coming. Now, I know you were told that if you came out here this morning, you would get a message from the most important person in England. And I don’t want to let you down, so I’ve got a message from the most important person in England, and that is of course Fabio Capello, the England manager. And he wrote me this: ‘Dear Prime Minister, as you’re travelling out to see the service men and women, I would like to ask if you could relay this message on behalf of me and all the England team’. And this was his message: ‘While the players receive incredible support from the country as we’re about to kick off in the World Cup, it’s important you know how much all your efforts mean to all the players and staff with the England team. Your brave service to your country means so much to the players, and we will all have complete respect for the incredible sacrifices that you and your families have made. While we will be doing all we can to achieve success in South Africa for the whole country, we want you to know that we believe that you are the real heroes’. And I think Fabio is absolutely right with what he says. Now, last night I was talking to some of the Scots Guards and of course I was saying, ‘Come on guys, you’ve got to be cheering on England’. And I’m not sure I got - I did get one. I cut a deal with them. I said if it ends up as England-Argentina, you’ve got to cheer for England. I think I would call that progress. But I want to say a really big thank you. You need to know how proud everyone is at home of what you do. And they are proud whatever you are doing here: whether you’re the ones sorting the mail or whether you’re defusing Taliban bombs; whether you’re fighting on the frontline or whether you’re being supported and helping people on the frontline. We’re incredibly proud of everything that you do. Some of the stories we read are just so inspiring. I think of Flight Lieutenant Fortune, who was a Chinook pilot shot in the head, but carried on because he had six casualties on his Chinook and he wanted to get the job done. I think of Kate Nesbitt, a medical assistant, who ran across an open field under fire to reach a fallen comrade and to give vital life-saving treatment while still being fired on. I think of Staff Sergeant Kim Hughes, who without any body armour, without any equipment, without any protective clothing crawled through the dust to disable seven linked Taliban mines because he wanted to get to his fallen comrades. These stories inspire people back at home because when Kim Hughes was asked, why he did what he did, he said what you always say: ‘I was just doing my job’. But I’ve got to tell you: most people couldn’t do your job. I couldn’t do your job. People at home couldn’t do your job, but we’re incredibly proud that you do do your job. So a really big thank you from everyone at home. Ad it’s worth remembering why we’re here, why we’re fighting, what this is all about. This is not a war of choice; it is a war of necessity. This is not a war of occupation; it is a war of obligation. On 9/11 when the Twin Towers were blown up and so many British people died as well as Americans, almost every single person that took part in that attack was trained here in Afghanistan by Al Qaeda. That is why we came here, that is why we cleared away those training camps, and if we left tomorrow those training camps could come back tomorrow, because today the Afghans are not yet ready to look after their own security. As soon as they are ready, and you are helping them to be ready, then we can leave and go home. Big progress is being made. I can see it in the training of the Afghan national army, in the training of the Afghan police. The fact that we now control 11 out of the 14 provinces here in Helmand, the fact that we have a good governor - Governor Mangal - the fact that we are spreading governance across Helmand. You are doing incredible work and just as soon as we have trained up that Afghan security, we can go home with our heads held high. I know what I can expect from you. I can expect that bravery, that dedication, that service. And I just want to say a couple of words about what you can expect from me as your new Prime Minister. The first is a clear sense of mission, of why we’re here. We’re not here to build the perfect democracy. We’re not here to build some perfect model society. We are here to help the Afghans take control of their security so we can go home. I can sum up this mission in two words: it is about national security, our national security back in the UK. Clearing Al Qaeda out of Afghanistan, damaging them in Pakistan, making sure this country is safe and secure, will make us safe and secure back home in the United Kingdom. We don’t have some dreamy ideas about what this mission is about; it’s about that, pure and simple. The second thing you can expect from me is proper support. I know how hard you all work out here, and I know the promise that I made to all of you, that we would double the operational allowance. And I can tell you today, it is going to be doubled; you’re going to get it next month, and it’s going to be backdated to the date of the general election. But there are many other ways in which you deserve our support. Making sure the good equipment keeps coming through; making sure the new vehicles keep coming through. Making sure - and we will do this - we double the number of IED teams, so that when you go out on patrol - when you’re out of the bases, out of the FOBs - you’re getting proper protection. Alongside proper support is proper backing at home. I want to make sure, as Prime Minister, that all the things that your families and you can quibble about back at home - whether you’re getting good schools, whether you’re getting proper healthcare, the state of the housing and the flats that some of you have to live in - that we take action on all of these things; and we re-write, and re-publish, that military covenant, the covenant between the government and the civilians of a country and its military: that you do so much for us, and we’re going to properly look after you. We’re going to re-write that covenant. So, a clear mission, proper support for what you do, and backing at home. But I think there is a fourth thing as well. And that is to give real leadership in our country, to make sure that we support our military in its broadest sense, in every single way that we can. During the First and the Second World Wars, and during the Falklands War, there was real support in our country for the military. And I want to put you front and centre of our national life again. I think it’s vital. There’s huge respect and support for what the military does, and I want that in every single part of our country. And I want you to be proud of what you do. I want you to think of that great quotation: that it’s not the politician that brings the right to vote; it is the soldier. It’s not the poet that brings free speech; it is the soldier. It’s not the journalist that brings free expression; it is the soldier. So I want you to help me create a new atmosphere in our country - an atmosphere where we back and revere and support our military. Now, I know there will be times when you’ll feel quite down - when you’ll miss your loved ones at home; when you’ll long for that leave; when you’ll wish that you were back home having a quiet pint, or maybe even, as someone said to me, from Nottingham, yesterday, a slightly more noisy pint, when he goes out on a Friday night. I know there will be times when you’re down. And when that happens I want you to think of this: think of what you’re achieving. Think of that soldier who said, ‘Those things we do for ourselves; they die with us. Those things we do for others and for our world are immortal; they never die; they’re never forgotten.’ What you’re doing here will never be forgotten. It is great and important work. You are incredibly brave and professional in what you do. And I stand here, as your Prime Minister, wanting to tell you, from the bottom of my heart, that you should be proud of yourselves and what you do, because your country is incredibly proud of you. Thank you for coming; thank you for listening; thank you for everything you do for our country. You make me proud to be standing here as your Prime Minister. Thank you.",Prime Minister,David Cameron,https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/pms-speech-at-camp-bastion,,INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS
Russia,17-03-2003,Vladimir Putin,Opening Remarks at a Meeting with Religious Leaders of the Chechen Republic,"Esteemed friends,

You know I am regularly meeting with religious leaders, the representatives of various denominations: Christian, Muslim and others. Therefore I am especially pleased to see in the Kremlin the spiritual leaders of Chechnya and to be able to exchange with you opinions on the problems which today especially worry not only Chechnya, but also the whole North Caucasus region.

In Russia, and in the Caucasus in particular, the authority of spiritual leaders has in all times been very high. Their opinion is carefully heeded, their word is trusted.

We highly appreciate your role in the establishment of mutual understanding between the followers of the various religions, and in the promotion of stability and interethnic harmony in the North Caucasus in particular, and in Russia as a whole. And understand – it was largely thanks to your position that there failed the extremists' and radicals' large-scale ideological expansion in the North Caucasus. They were never able to consolidate their hold.

Today, when terrorists are trying to use religious values for the achievement of far from moral aims, your firm position is of the utmost importance.

Obviously the problem is particularly acute in Chechnya. Here active preparations are under way for the constitutional referendum and we highly appreciate your support. It was in Chechnya that fundamentalists tried with particular vigour to organize the propaganda of their ideas. And tens of thousands of ordinary citizens – both Christians and Muslims – became the bandits' victims in the process.

The referendum – I am firmly convinced of this and said this in my address to the Chechen people – is the sole possible way to normalizing the situation in the republic. It is the most democratic way to creating a legal basis for the activity of the bodies of power.

The adoption of a Constitution and of laws on presidential and parliamentary elections will make the work on the reconstruction of the republic effective and responsible. And what is extremely important – will open the way for a cultural and spiritual revival of the people of Chechnya. I want to stress that the adoption of a Constitution is not going to predetermine the results of parliamentary elections or of presidential elections. This only gives the legitimate possibility to do that in a worthy manner.

One major theme is the possibility of concluding a special treaty between the Federation and the Chechen Republic. A treaty which will have to concretize the ways of achieving broad autonomy for Chechnya as part of Russia.

You are carrying out big work on the explanation of the commandments of traditional Islam, and helping bring up children and young people on the values of humanism and morality. I believe that that work is strengthening peace and harmony in society.

In many regions of Russia they understand this, find a field for joint work with religious organizations, and support religious centres and educational institutions. We shall yet be able to speak about this today, I hope.

Another key question is the organization in the republic of a judicial system. Unfortunately, the commonly adopted attitude to a court judgment as one final and binding is currently lacking in Chechnya. Judicial practice encounters here both the contradictions in law sources and, let us say frankly, the unsatisfactory organization of the work of the courts themselves. Although, it has to be admitted, the very fact of their existence is already an achievement. The judicial system is being strengthened.

Without exaggeration, your word here is extremely significant. And we must together look for a solution ensuring a worthy level of protection of civil rights in Chechnya.

* * *

I did not want to speak of the problem of Iraq today, but once you have recalled this. I know that only recently a communal prayer was held practically in all the mosques of the country over the developments in Iraq with the wish to resolve all the problems around that country by peaceful means.

You know the stand of the Russian leadership – we favour resolving all the problems around Iraq solely by diplomatic means. And our position remains invariable. I am convinced that any other development of events would be a mistake which could entail not only human casualties, which is, in itself, inadmissible – there has been a lot of suffering already – but it would destabilize considerably the international situation as a whole.

In Russia there live, as we know from the last population census, almost 20 million Muslims. This is a serious factor in our life. We cannot but take into consideration the sentiments of the Muslims, including the Muslims of Chechnya. Therefore I want to reassure you that our position remains clear, understandable and invariable.

As to the principal theme for which we have today gathered – of course, in the last decade very many mistakes have been made, including those on the part of the federal centre. In these conditions, of course, it is very hard for the ordinary citizen to make out what is happening; it is very difficult to make the right choice, to determine one's own position. And sometimes also terrifying, because when there is no power, the state cannot protect its ordinary citizen. We have no right to forget about this, and so I take very seriously your appeal that it is necessary to give an opportunity to all, including those who have not yet laid down arms, to return to a peaceful life.

I think that if the referendum passes successfully and if the results are positive, then this gives considerable grounds for the leadership of Chechnya, indeed greater moral grounds to raise before the parliament of Russia the question of solving these problems in just this way. For my part I will be ready to support that.",President,Vladimir Putin,http://en.kremlin.ru/events/president/transcripts/statements/21941,,OTHERS
USA,08-06-2021 00:00,Joe Biden,Statement of President Joe Biden on Senate Passage of the U.S. Innovation and Competition Act,"I applaud the United States Senate — led by the dedicated efforts of Majority Leader Schumer and Senators Todd Young, Maria Cantwell, and Roger Wicker — for coming together to pass the U.S. Innovation and Competition Act.  This legislation addresses key elements that were included in my American Jobs Plan, and I am encouraged by this bipartisan effort to advance those elements separately through this bill.

It is long past time that we invest in American workers and American innovation.  Along with the American Jobs Plan, the U.S. Innovation and Competition Act would make generational investments in research and development and advanced manufacturing to help us grow critical industries and win the jobs of the future.  It will empower us to discover, build, and enhance tomorrow’s most vital technologies — from artificial intelligence, to computer chips, to the lithium batteries used in smart devices and electric vehicles — right here in the United States.  By strengthening our innovation infrastructure, we can lay the foundation for the next generation of American jobs and American leadership in manufacturing and technology.

We are in a competition to win the 21st century, and the starting gun has gone off.  As other countries continue to invest in their own research and development, we cannot risk falling behind.  America must maintain its position as the most innovative and productive nation on Earth.  I look forward to working with the House of Representatives on this important bipartisan legislation, and I look forward to signing it into law as soon as possible.

USA,05-09-2021 00:00,Joe Biden,Statement by President Joe Biden on Rosh Hashanah,"On Rosh Hashanah, Jewish communities around the world celebrate the world’s birth and commemorate the creation of humankind.

Rosh Hashanah and the Days of Awe that follow charge those who celebrate to pause, look inward, and reflect on the past year. It is a time to undertake an inventory of the soul, a cheshbon hanefesh, and to ask of ourselves and of each other questions that go beyond our own individual faiths: Who do I want to be? What type of nation do we want to forge? What type of world do we want to create?

That is the message and gift of the Jewish New Year – a reminder of our infinite capacity to transform our lives and begin anew. To partner with the Divine and our fellow human beings in the ongoing work of creation. To rebuild our communities through empathy, acts of kindness, and compassion. To seek repentance, or teshuva, when we have fallen short of our values. Rosh Hashanah is a reaffirmation that we are each endowed, by virtue of our Creator and our common humanity, with the ability to bridge the gap between the world we see and the world we seek.

In that effort, we’ve made significant progress, but much work remains. To protect ourselves and each other against a once-in-a-century virus. To rebuild an economy that provides opportunity for all Americans. To give hate no safe harbor, and speak out with clarity and conviction against antisemitism wherever and however it manifests. To reaffirm our ironclad bond with the State of Israel.

May the year 5782 be a year of health, healing, and progress. And may we all be inscribed in the Book of Life.

Jill and I extend our warmest wishes to all those celebrating Rosh Hashanah in the United States, Israel, and around the world.

Shanah Tovah U’Metukah. May it be a sweet, healthy, and happy new year.",President,Joe Biden,https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/09/05/statement-by-president-joe-biden-on-rosh-hashanah/,,OTHERS
United Kingdom,09-Mar-20,Boris Johnson,Prime Minister's statement on coronavirus (COVID-19): 9 March 2020,"This morning I chaired a meeting of the government’s COBR emergency committee on the Coronavirus outbreak. The First Ministers of Scotland and Wales and the First Minister and deputy First Minister of Northern Ireland also attended and we agreed to continue to work closely in the weeks and months ahead. We received a detailed briefing from the Chief Medical Officer and the Chief Scientific Advisor. And again I repeat my gratitude to both Chris and to Patrick. There have now been four deaths from coronavirus in the UK, and our deepest sympathies are obviously with their friends and families. Our action plan as you know sets out the four phases of our approach to tackling the virus: Contain, Delay, Research, and Mitigate. We remain in the Contain phase of the outbreak, but watching what is happening around the world, our scientists think containment is extremely unlikely to work on its own, and that is why we are making extensive preparations for a move to the delay phase. We are preparing various actions to slow the spread of this disease in order to reduce the strain it places on the NHS. The more we can delay the peak of the spread to the summer, the better the NHS will be able to manage. Patrick and Chris will give you some more detailed information on the latest advice we are giving the public today - and how we expect that advice to change as the outbreak develops. As things stand I’m afraid it bears repeating that the best thing we can all do is wash our hands for 20 seconds with soap and water. We will also take questions, because I know there are lots of things the public want to hear from our advisors about. But before that I want to stress the following things: First, we are doing everything we can to combat this outbreak, based on the very latest scientific and medical advice. Second, we have a truly brilliant NHS, where staff have responded with all the determination, compassion and skill that makes their service so revered across the world. And they will continue to have this government’s full support, my support, in tackling this virus on the frontline. Third, we will set out further steps in the days and weeks ahead to help people protect themselves, their family and in particular the elderly and vulnerable. And finally, while it is absolutely critical, it’s absolutely critical in managing the spread of this virus that we take the right decisions at the right time, based on the latest and best evidence. So we must not do things which have no or limited medical benefit, nor things which could turn out to be counterproductive. There is no hiding from the fact that the coronavirus outbreak will present significant challenges for the UK, just as it does in other countries. But if we continue to look out for one another, to pull together in a united and national effort, I have no doubt that we can and will rise to that challenge. And I’m now going to ask Patrick and then Chris to give their own perspective on where we are.",Prime Minister,Boris Johnson,https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/pm-statement-on-coronavirus-9-march-2020,,DEVELOPMENT
United Kingdom,11-May-20,Boris Johnson,PM statement in the House of Commons: 11 May 2020,"Mr Speaker, with permission, I will make a statement about the next steps in our battle against coronavirus, and how we can, with the utmost caution, gradually begin to rebuild our economy and reopen our society. For the last two months, the British people have faced a grave threat with common sense, compassion and unflinching resolve. We have together observed the toughest restrictions on our freedoms in memory, changing our way of life on a scale unimaginable only months ago. All our efforts have been directed towards protecting our NHS and saving lives. Tragically, many families have lost loved ones before their time and we share their grief. Yet our shared effort has averted a still worse catastrophe, one that could have overwhelmed the NHS and claimed half a million lives. Every day, dedicated doctors, nurses, and social care workers, army medics and more have risked their own lives in the service of others, they have helped to cut the Reproduction rate from between 2.6 and 2.8 in April to between 0.5 and 0.9 today. The number of covid patients in hospital has fallen by over a third since Easter Sunday. Our armed forces joined our NHS to build new hospitals on timetables that were telescoped from years to weeks, almost doubling the number of critical care beds, and ensuring that since the end of March, at least a third have always been available. Our challenge now is to find a way forward that preserves our hard won gains, while easing the burden of the lockdown. And I will be candid with the House: this is a supremely difficult balance to strike. There could be no greater mistake than to jeopardise everything we have striven to achieve by proceeding too far and too fast. We will be driven not by hope or economic revival as an end in itself, but by data, and science and public health. And so the Government is submitting to the House today a plan which is conditional and dependent as always on the common sense and observance of the British people, and on continual re-assessment of the data. That picture varies across the regions and Home Nations of the United Kingdom, requiring a flexible response. Different parts of the UK may need to stay in full lockdown longer but any divergence should only be short-term because as Prime Minister of the UK, I am in no doubt that we must defeat this threat and face the challenge of recovery together. Our progress will depend on meeting five essential tests: protecting the NHS, reducing both the daily death toll and the infection rate in a sustained way,ensuring that testing and PPE can meet future demand - a global problem, but one that we must fix, and avoiding a second peak that would overwhelm the NHS. A new UK-wide Joint Biosecurity Centre will measure our progress with a five-stage Covid Alert System, and the combined effect of our measures so far has been to prevent us from reaching Level Five, a situation that would have seen the NHS overwhelmed, and to hold us at Level Four. Thanks to the hard work and sacrifice of the British people by following the social distancing rules, we are now in a position where we can move in stages to where I hope the scientific advice will tell us that we are down to Level Three. But this will only happen if everyone continues to play their part, to stay alert and to follow the rules. We must also deal with the epidemic in care homes, where a tragic number of the elderly and vulnerable have been lost and while the situation is thankfully improving, there is a vast amount more to be done. And of course we need a world-leading system for testing and tracking and tracing victims and their contacts so I’m delighted that Baroness Harding, the chair of NHS Improvement, has agreed to take charge of a programme that will ultimately enable us to test hundreds of thousands of people every day. All this means we have begun our descent from the peak of the epidemic, but our journey has reached the most perilous moment where a wrong move could be disastrous. So at this stage, we can go no further than to announce the first careful modifications of our measures, Step 1 in moving towards Covid Alert Level 3, a shift in emphasis that we can begin this week. Anyone who cannot work from home should be actively encouraged to go to work. And sectors that are allowed to be open should indeed be open, but subject to social distancing. These include food production, construction, manufacturing, logistics, distribution, scientific research. And to support this, to explain this again, we are publishing guidance for businesses on how to make these workplaces safe. Covid secure. People who are able to work from home, as we’ve continually said, should continue to do so, and people who cannot work from home should talk to their employers about returning this week and the difficulties they may or may not have. Anyone with covid symptoms obviously – or in a household where someone else has symptoms – should self-isolate. We want everyone travelling to work to be safe, so people should continue to avoid public transport wherever possible because we must maintain social distancing which will inevitably limit capacity. Instead people should drive or better still walk or cycle. With more activity outside our homes, we would now advise people to wear a cloth face covering in enclosed spaces where social distancing is not always possible, and you are more likely to come in contact with people you do not normally meet. The reason is face coverings can help to protect each other and reduce the spread of the disease, particularly if you have coronavirus like symptoms. But this does not mean – and I must stress this – this does not mean wearing medical face masks, 2R or FFP3, which must be reserved for people who need them. We have all lived so far with onerous restrictions Mr Speaker on outdoor spaces and exercise, and this is where my honourable friend interjects as I know he’s a keen swimmer and unfortunately we can’t do anything for swimming pools but we can do something for lakes and the sea. and this is where we can go significantly further because there is a lower risk from outdoors than indoors. So from Wednesday there will be no limits on the frequency of outdoor exercise people can take. You can now walk, sit and rest in parks, you can play sports and exercise, and you can do all these things with members of your own household, or with one other person from another household, provided you observe social distancing and remain 2 metres apart from them. And I do hope that’s clear Mr Speaker. I’m conscious people want to come back and ask questions in more detail and I’d be very happy to answer. We shall increase the fines for the small minority who break the rules, starting at £100 but doubling with each infringement up to £3,600. You can drive as far as you like to reach an outdoor space, subject to the same rules and the laws and guidance of the Devolved Administrations. I am sorry to say however, Mr Speaker, that we shall continue to ask those who are clinically vulnerable – including pregnant women and people over 70, or those with pre-existing chronic conditions – to take particular care to minimise contact with those outside their households. And we must continue to shield people who are extremely vulnerable. They should, I am afraid, remain at home and avoid any direct contact with others. I know that easing restrictions for the many will only increase the anguish of those who must remain shielded, so the Government will look at every possible way of supporting the most vulnerable. Mr Speaker, all of our precautions will count for little if our country is re-infected from overseas, so I give notice that we shall introduce new restrictions at the UK border, requiring 14 days of self-isolation for international arrivals, while respecting our common travel area with Ireland. Every day, we shall monitor our progress, and if we stay on the downward slope, and the R remains below 1, then – and only then – will it become safe to go further, and move to the second step. This will not happen until 1st June at the earliest, but we may then be in a position to start the phased reopening of shops; to return children to early years’ settings, including nurseries and childminders; to return primary schools in stages, giving priority to the youngest children in reception and year 1, and those in year 6 preparing for secondary school; and to enable secondary school pupils facing exams next year to get at least some time with their teachers. Our ambition – and I stress this is conditional Mr Speaker –is for all primary school pupils to return to the classroom for a month before the summer break. To those ends, we are publishing guidance on how schools might reopen safely. Step two could also include allowing cultural and sporting events behind closed doors for broadcast, which I think would provide a much needed boost to national morale. But nothing can substitute for human contact and so the Government has asked SAGE when and how we could safely allow people to expand their household group to include one other household, on a strictly reciprocal basis. Finally, and no earlier than July, we may be able to move to step three – if and only if supported by the data, and the best scientific advice. We would then aim to reopen some remaining businesses, including potentially hospitality, cinemas and hairdressers as well as places of worship and leisure facilities. And this will depend on maintaining social distancing and new ways of providing services, so we will phase and pilot any re-openings to ensure public safety. And I must be clear again: if the data goes the wrong way, if the Alert Level begins to rise, we will have no hesitation in putting on the brakes, delaying or reintroducing measures – locally, regionally or nationally. Mr Speaker, our struggle against this virus has placed our country under the kind of strain that will be remembered for generations. But so too has the response of the British people, from dedicated shopworkers keeping our supermarkets open, and ingenious teachers finding new ways of inspiring their pupils, to the kindness of millions who have checked on their neighbours, delivered food for the elderly, or raised astonishing amounts for charity. In these and in so many other ways, we are seeing the indomitable spirit of Britain And Mr speaker let me summarise by saying that people should Stay Alert by working from home if you possibly can, by limiting contact with other people, by keeping your distance 2 metres apart where possible - by washing your hands regularly, and if you or anyone in your household has symptoms, you all need to self-isolate. Because if everyone stays alert and follows the rules, we can control the virus, keep the rate of infection down and the keep number of infections down. And this Mr Speaker is how we can continue to save lives, and livelihoods, as we begin to recover from coronavirus, and I commend this statement to the House.",Prime Minister,Boris Johnson,https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/pm-statement-in-the-house-of-commons-11-may-2020,,DEVELOPMENT
Russia,22-12-2000,Vladimir Putin,Speech at a Meeting to Mark the 80th Anniversary of the GOELRO Plan,"Friends,

Power Engineer’s Day coincides with a momentous date, the 80th anniversary of the adoption of the State Plan for the Electrification of Russia, the GOELRO Plan.

The GOELRO Plan is a symbol of an entire era, an era of hopes and unheard of enthusiasm. It marked the starting point for creating the power system in the country. No less importantly, it was the first scientifically grounded long-term programme of the country’s economic development. In fact, the emergence of our country as an industrial power began with the GOELRO Plan.

So today is not only a red-letter day for people in the energy sphere. It is a historic milestone in the life of our people and the peoples of the former Soviet Union.

The electrification plan was launched in a difficult period of the Civil War and economic dislocation. Skeptics described the GOELRO Plan as a fiction and a utopia.

They were mistaken.

First, it was a thoroughly considered project that took a long time to develop. It began to be developed before the First World War.

And secondly, as time has shown, the GOELRO Plan was not only fulfilled but considerably over-fulfilled. The Russian power industry quickly gained momentum, and within 15 years we ranked second in Europe and third in the world in terms of the amount of electricity generated.

The creation of the Single Power Grid in the mid-1950s was a natural continuation of the GOELRO Plan. It increased the country’s industrial potential many times over and became a powerful factor of economic integration that linked all the country’s industrial regions.

The cementing and uniting impact of that factor increased the country’s potential over time. That is something well worth remembering now that the country is on the rise again.

The success of the GOELRO Plan is not only the result of a massive labour effort. It is also a tribute to precise calculations and excellent organisation, the ability and painstaking work of economists and energy experts, those who calculated and checked out all the details of that incredibly bold project.

Today, when arguments about the future of the power sector in the country are reminiscent of the 1920s, we again must meet the challenge of the times. We must again approach the massive task of supplying the country with energy in a thoughtful and precise way. Our actions in the power sector determine the future of Russia, its resurgence, wellbeing and political stability, and the social welfare of all our citizens.

Today is a big red-letter day, but a true holiday is preceded by prolonged and strenuous day-to-day work. So I cannot sidestep the problems of the power sector.

At the top of the list of problems are those that have to do with people. Above all, the uninterrupted supply of heating and electricity in some regions.

There are, of course, strategic issues connected with the development of the sector as a whole, which are the subject of heated arguments. I think the decisions must be well calculated and well balanced, and they must come from energy specialists and economists. I repeat, we are talking about a long-term programme, large-scale and serious work to modernise the sector and optimise management.

In order to successfully solve these tasks, we must have a clear-cut and well-grounded strategy for the reform and development of the Russian energy sector, closely linked with the national economic strategy. As we develop it, it is our duty to draw on the historical experience, including GOELRO. But at the same time, we should use modern market methods drawing on our own and foreign experience.

Electrification is a key sector of the economy in any country. But for Russia (especially its northern part) power means much more: it is life in the direct sense of the word. So we must be aware of the importance of the tasks facing us.

We must carefully weigh and calculate the consequences of the decisions we take. These are not problems that concern individual agencies. The interests of the whole country are at stake, and indeed, the interests of all Russian citizens. I think that the workers in your sector are well aware of that.

You know that the first unit of the North-Western Thermal Power Plant which uses unique technologies, will be launched today. It is important to make sure that the event itself does not remain unique.

The energy sector has at all times employed excellent specialists, true professionals. You take the credit for keeping the Russian power system stable. It could only have been accomplished by people that are truly dedicated to their job.

And now I pass on to the ceremonial part. It is my honour to give state decorations to the foremost workers in the energy sector. ",President,Vladimir Putin,http://en.kremlin.ru/events/president/transcripts/statements/21147,,DEVELOPMENT
USA,15-03-2013,Barack Obama,"
Remarks by the President on American Energy -- Lemont, Illinois","Hello, everybody!  (Applause.)  Hello, Illinois!  Hello!  It is good to be home!  (Applause.)

Well, let me begin by thanking Ann for the great introduction, the great work she’s doing, the leadership she’s showing with her team on so many different, amazing technological breakthroughs.  I want to thank Dr. Isaacs and Dr. Crabtree for giving me a great tour of your facilities. 

It’s not every day that I get to walk into a thermal test chamber.  (Laughter.)  I told my girls that I was going to go into a thermal test chamber and they were pretty excited.  I told them I’d come out looking like the Hulk.  (Laughter.)  They didn’t believe that. 

I want to thank my friend and your friend -- a truly great U.S. Senator, Senator Dick Durbin -- huge supporter of Argonne.  (Applause.)  An outstanding member of Congress who actually could explain some of the stuff that's going on here -- Bill Foster is here.  (Applause.)  Congressman Bobby Rush, a big supporter of Argonne -- glad he’s here.  (Applause.)  We’ve got a number of state and local officials with us, including your Mayor, Brian Reaves.  (Applause.) 

And I could not come to Argonne without bringing my own Nobel Prize-winning scientist, someone who has served our country so well over the past four years -- our Energy Secretary, Dr. Steven Chu.  (Applause.) 

Now, I’m here today to talk about what should be our top priority as a nation, and that's reigniting the true engine of America’s economic growth -- a rising, thriving middle class and an economy built on innovation.  In my State of the Union address, I said our most important task was to drive that economic growth, and I meant it.  And every day, we should be asking ourselves three questions:  How do we make America a magnet for good jobs?  How do we equip our people with the skills and training to do those jobs?  And how do we make sure that hard work leads to a decent living? 

Those of you who have chairs -- I wasn’t sure everybody had chairs there.  (Laughter.)  Please feel free to sit down -- I'm sorry.  Everybody was standing and I thought Argonne -- one of the effects of the sequester, you had to -- (laughter) -- get rid of chairs.  (Applause.)  That's good, I'm glad we've got some chairs. 

So I chose Argonne National Lab because right now, few areas hold more promise for creating good jobs and growing our economy than how we use American energy. 

After years of talking about it, we’re finally poised to take control of our energy future.  We produce more oil than we have in 15 years.  We import less oil than we have in 20 years.  We’ve doubled the amount of renewable energy that we generate from sources like wind and solar -- with tens of thousands of good jobs to show for it.  We’re producing more natural gas than we ever have before -- with hundreds of thousands of good jobs to show for it.  We supported the first new nuclear power plant in America since the 1970s.  And we’re sending less carbon pollution into the environment than we have in nearly 20 years.

So we’re making real progress across the board.  And it’s possible, in part, because of labs like this and outstanding scientists like so many of you, entrepreneurs, innovators -- all of you who are working together to take your discoveries and turn them into a business. 

So think about this:  Just a few years ago, the American auto industry was flat-lining.  Today, thanks in part to discoveries made right here at Argonne, some of the most high-tech, fuel-efficient, pretty spiffy cars in the world are once again designed, engineered and built here in the United States. 

And that’s why we have to keep investing in scientific research.  It’s why we have to maintain our edge -- because the work you’re doing today will end up in the products that we make and sell tomorrow.  You’re helping to secure our energy future.  And if we do it well, then that’s going to help us avoid some of the perils of climate change and leave a healthier planet for our kids.  But to do it, we’ve got to make sure that we’re making the right choices in Washington. 

Just the other day, Dr. Isaacs and directors of two of our other national laboratories wrote about the effects of the so-called sequester -- these across-the-board budget cuts put in place two weeks ago -- and specifically the effects it will have on America’s scientific research.  And one of the reasons I was opposed to these cuts is because they don’t distinguish between wasteful programs and vital investments.  They don’t trim the fat; they cut into muscle and into bone -- like research and development being done right here that not only gives a great place for young researchers to come and ply their trade, but also ends up creating all kinds of spinoffs that create good jobs and good wages.   

So Dr. Isaacs said these cuts will force him to stop any new project that’s coming down the line.  And I’m quoting him now -- he says, “This sudden halt on new starts will freeze American science in place while the rest of the world races forward, and it will knock a generation of young scientists off their stride, ultimately costing billions of dollars in missed future opportunities.”  I mean, essentially because of this sequester, we’re looking at two years where we don’t start new research.  And at a time when every month you’ve got to replace your smartphone because something new has come up, imagine what that means when China and Germany and Japan are all continuing to plump up their basic research, and we’re just sitting there doing nothing. 

We can’t afford to miss these opportunities while the rest of the world races forward.  We have to seize these opportunities.  I want the next great job-creating breakthroughs -- whether it’s in energy or nanotechnology or bioengineering -- I want those breakthroughs to be right here in the United States of America, creating American jobs and maintaining our technological lead.  (Applause.)  

So I just want to be clear -- these cuts will harm, not help, our economy.  They aren’t the smart way to cut our deficits.  And that’s why I’m reaching out to Republicans and Democrats to come together around a balanced approach, a smart, phased-in approach to deficit reduction that includes smart spending cuts and entitlement reforms and new revenue, and that won’t hurt our middle class or slow economic growth.  And if we do that, then we can move beyond governing from crisis to crisis to crisis, and we keep our focus on policies that actually create jobs and grow our economy, and move forward to face all of the other challenges we face, from fixing our broken immigration system to educating our kids to keeping them safe from gun violence. 

And few pieces of business are more important for us than getting our energy future right.  So here at Argonne, and other labs around the country, scientists are working on getting us where we need to get 10 years from now, 20 years from now.  Today, what most Americans feel first when it comes to energy prices -- or energy issues are prices that they pay at the pump. And over the past few weeks, we saw -- we went through another spike in gas prices.  And people are nodding here.  They weren’t happy about it.  The problem is this happens every year.  It happened last year, the year before that.  And it’s a serious blow to family budgets.  It feels like you’re getting hit with a new tax coming right out of your pocket.  And every time it happens, politicians -- they dust off their three-point plans for $2 gas, but nothing happens and then we go through the same cycle again. 

But here’s the thing:  Over the past four years, we haven’t just talked about it, we’ve actually started doing something about it.  We’ve worked with the auto companies to put in place the toughest fuel economy standards in our history.  And what that means is, by the middle of the next decade, our cars will go twice as far on a gallon of gas.  And the standards that we set are part of what’s driving some of the amazing scientists and engineers who are working here at Argonne Labs.  We’ve set some achievable but ambitious goals.  So in the middle of the next decade, we expect that you’ll fill up half as often, which means you spend half as much.  And over the life of a new car, the average family will save more than $8,000 at the pump.  That's worth applauding.  That's big news.  (Applause.) 

In fact, a new report issued today shows that America is becoming a global leader in advanced vehicles.  You walk into any dealership today, and you’ll see twice as many hybrids to choose from as there were five years ago.  You’ll see seven times as many cars that can go 40 miles a gallon or more.  And as costs go down, sales are going up.

Last year, General Motors sold more hybrid vehicles than ever before.  Ford is selling some of the most fuel-efficient cars so quickly that dealers are having a tough time keeping up with the demand.  So by investing in our energy security, we’re helping our businesses succeed and we’re creating good middle-class jobs right here in America.

So we’re making progress, but the only way to really break this cycle of spiking gas prices, the only way to break that cycle for good is to shift our cars entirely -- our cars and trucks -- off oil.  That’s why, in my State of the Union address, I called on Congress to set up an Energy Security Trust to fund research into new technologies that will help us reach that goal. 
Now, I’d like to take credit for this idea because it’s a good idea, but I can’t.  Basically, my proposal builds off a proposal that was put forward by a non-partisan coalition that includes retired generals and admirals and leading CEOs.  And these leaders came together around a simple idea -- much of our energy is drawn from lands and waters that we, the public, own together.  So what they’ve proposed is let’s take some of our oil and gas revenues from public lands and put it towards research that will benefit the public so we can support American ingenuity without adding a dime to our deficit.

We can support scientists who are designing new engines that are more energy efficient; support scientists that are developing cheaper batteries that can go farther on a single charge; support scientists and engineers that are devising new ways to fuel our cars and trucks with new sources of clean energy -- like advanced biofuels and natural gas -- so drivers can one day go coast to coast without using a drop of oil. 

And the reason so many different people from the private sector, the public sector, our military support this idea is because it’s not just about saving money; it’s also about saving the environment, but it’s also about our national security.  For military officials -- like General Paul Kelley, a former Commandant of the Marine Corps -- this is about national security.  Our reliance on oil makes us way too dependent on other parts of the world, many of which are very volatile.  For business leaders -- like Fred Smith, the CEO of FedEx -- this is about economic security, because when fuel prices shoot up, it’s harder to plan investments, expand operations, create new jobs. 

So these leaders all say we need to fix this.  This is not a Democratic idea or a Republican idea.  This is just a smart idea. And we should be taking their advice.  Let’s set up an Energy Security Trust that helps us free our families and our businesses from painful spikes in gas once and for all.  (Applause.)  Let’s do that.  We can do it.  We’ve done it before.  We innovated here at Argonne.   

And in the meantime, we’ll keep moving on the all-of-the-above energy strategy that we’ve been working on for the last couple years, where we're producing more oil and gas here at home but we're also producing more biofuels, we're also producing more fuel-efficient vehicles; more solar power; more wind power.  We're working to make sure that here in America we're building cars and homes and businesses that waste less energy. 

We can do this.  The nature of America's miraculous rise has been our drive, our restless spirit, our willingness to reach out to new horizons, our willingness to take risks, our willingness to innovate.  We are not satisfied just because things -- this is how things have been.  We're going to try something that maybe we just imagine now, but if we work at it, we'll achieve it.  That’s the nature of America.  That’s what Argonne National Lab is about.  That’s what this facility is about.  (Applause.)  

Two decades ago, scientists at Argonne, led by Mike Thackeray, who’s here today -- where is Mike?  There he is right here.  (Applause.)  Mike started work on a rechargeable lithium battery for cars.  And some folks at the time said the idea wasn’t worth the effort.  They said that even if you had the technology, the car would cost too much, it wouldn’t go far enough. 

But Mike and his team knew better.  They knew you could do better.  And America, our government, our federal government made it a priority, and we funded those efforts.  And Mike went to work.  And when others gave up, the team kept on at it.  And when development hit a snag, the team found solutions.  And a few years ago, all of this hard work paid off, and scientists here at Argonne helped create a lithium ion battery that costs less, lasts longer than any that had come before. 

So what was just an idea two decades ago is now rolling off assembly lines in cutting-edge fuel efficient cars that you can plug in at night.  Well, imagine all the ideas right now with all of these young scientists and engineers that 20 years ago -- or 20 years from now will be offering solutions to our problems that we can't even comprehend -- as long as we're still funding these young scientists and engineers; as long as the pipeline for research is maintained; as long as we recognize there are some things we do together as a country because individually we can't do it -- and, by the way, the private sector on its own will not invest in this research because it's too expensive.  It's too risky.  They can't afford it in terms of their bottom lines.

So we've got to support it.  And we'll all benefit from it, and our kids will benefit from it, and our grandkids will benefit from it.  That’s who we are.  That’s been the American story. 

We don’t stand still, we look forward.  We invent.  We build.  We turn new ideas into new industries.  We change the way we can live our lives here at home and around the world.  That’s how we sent a man to the moon.  That’s how we invented the Internet. 

When somebody tells us we can't, we say, yes we can.  And I'm telling all of you, I am absolutely confident that America is poised to succeed in the same way as long as we don’t lose that spirit of innovation and recognize that we can only do it together.  And I'm going to work as hard as I can every single day to make sure that we do.

So congratulations, Argonne.  (Applause.)  Let's keep it up.  Thank you.  God bless you.  God bless America.",President,Barack Obama,https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/the-press-office/2013/03/15/remarks-president-american-energy-lemont-illinois,,DEVELOPMENT
USA,05-06-2017 00:00,Donald Trump,Remarks by President Trump at Announcement of Air Traffic Control Initiative,"THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you very much.  Thank you, Mike.  I really appreciate everything and I appreciate you being here.  But I especially want to thank Secretary Elaine Chao, Leader Kevin McCarthy — thank you, Kevin — Chairman Bill Shuster — thank you very much, Bill — and all the members of Congress — we have many of them here today — for joining us as we prepare to enter a great new era in American aviation.  (Applause.)  It’s about time, too, I can tell you.

But before discussing our plans to modernize air travel, I want to provide an update on our efforts to fix and modernize vital services for our veterans — our great, great veterans who we all love.  For decades the federal government has struggled to accomplish something that should be very, very simple — seamlessly transferring a veteran’s medical records from the Defense Department to the veterans groups and to the VA.  In recent years, it has taken not just days or weeks, but many months for the records to follow the veteran.  This has caused massive problems for our veterans.

I’m very proud to say that we are finally taking steps to solve this situation once and for all.  Secretary Shulkin announced this morning that the VA will announce and modernize its medical records to use the same system as the Department of Defense.  No more complications.  The records will now be able to follow the veteran when they leave service — meaning faster, better, and far better quality care.  (Applause.)  Thank you.

This is one of the biggest wins for our veterans in decades.  And I congratulate Secretary Shulkin for making this very, very important decision.  Thank you, Secretary.  Appreciate it.  I appreciate it.  He’s done a great job.  Stand up, Secretary.  Where is Secretary Shulkin?  What a great job.  Thank you.

Of course, there is still much work to do, but today’s action shows the determined leadership and what it can accomplish — great, great reform.  So, again, to David Shulkin, thank you.  To all of our veterans who have a served this nation, a very, very special thank you.  This is truly wonderful, really monumental reform, so important for our veterans.  But it’s just the beginning.

We’re here today to discuss another issue that has gone unsolved for far too long.  For too many years, our country has tolerated unacceptable delays at the airport, long wait times on the tarmac, and a slowing of commerce and travel that costs us billions and billions of dollars in lost hours and lost dollars themselves.  Today, we are proposing to take American air travel into the future — finally.  (Applause.)  Finally, right?  Finally.  It’s been a long time.

We’re proposing reduced wait times, increased route efficiency, and far fewer delays.  Our plan will get you where you need to go more quickly, more reliably, more affordably and, yes — for the first time in a long time — on time.  We will launch this air travel revolution by modernizing the outdated system of air traffic control.  It’s about time.  (Applause.)

Since the early days of commercial air service, the federal government has owned and operated the United States air traffic control system.  Yet, more than a half a century later, the government is still using much of the exact same outdated technology.  At a time when every passenger has GPS technology in their pockets, our air traffic control system still runs on radar and ground-based radio systems that they don’t even make anymore, they can’t even fix anymore, and many controllers must use slips of paper to track our thousands and thousands of planes that are up in the air.

Our air traffic control system was designed when roughly 100,000 people flew at our airports each year.  We are now approaching nearly one billion passengers annually.  The current system cannot keep up — hasn’t been able to keep up for many years.  It causes flight delays and crippling inefficiencies, costing our economy as much as $25 billion a year in economic output.  We live in a modern age, yet our air traffic control system is stuck painfully in the past.

The FAA has been trying to upgrade our nation’s air traffic control system for a long period of years.  But after billions and billions of tax dollars spent and the many years of delays, we are still stuck with an ancient, broken, antiquated, horrible system that doesn’t work.  Other than that, it’s quite good.  (Laughter.)

The previous administration spent over $7 billion trying to upgrade the system, and totally failed.  Honestly, they didn’t know what the hell they were doing.  A total waste of money — $7 billion-plus-plus.

It’s time to join the future.  That is why I’m proposing new principles to Congress for air traffic control reform making flights quicker, safer and more reliable.  Crucially, these reforms are supported by air traffic controllers themselves.  They’re the ones that know the systems that they want.  They know it better than anybody.  And we have people — they don’t even call them in the past.  But now we call them.

I’m also proud to be joined today by passenger advocates, pilot unions, and leaders of airlines and cargo companies who strongly support our new framework and our bidding process.  And we’re bidding, ideally, to one great company — there will be many bids, but one great company that can piece it all together — not many companies all over the United States, like in the past.  When they came time to piece it together, it didn’t work.  There were all different systems.  We threw away billions and billions of dollars.

I am very grateful that every former FAA chief and chief operating officers and three former Transportation Secretaries — Jim Burnley, Elizabeth Dole, and Mary Peters — stand with us today.  Thank you.  (Applause.)  This is an incredible coalition for change.  All over the room, it’s a coalition for change.  The leaders of the industry.

At its core, our new plan will dramatically improve America’s air traffic control system by turning it over to a self-financing, non-profit organization.  This new entity will not need taxpayer money, which is very shocking when people hear that.  They don’t hear that too often.

Under this new plan, the Federal Aviation Administration will focus firmly on what it does best — safety.  A separate non-profit entity would be charged with ensuring route efficiency, timely service, and a long-awaited reduction in delays.

Our plan will also maintain support for rural communities and small airports, including airfields used by our Air National Guard units — great people.  And, very importantly, air traffic controllers will highly — and this will be highly valued.  These are highly valued people.  These are amazing people that know this system so well.  And under our plan, they will have more financial security, professional opportunity, and far superior equipment.  The best equipment anywhere in the world.  There will never be anything like what we’re doing.  And other systems are very good.  I won’t tell you the names of the country, but we have studied numerous countries, one in particular — they have a very, very good system.  Ours is going to top it by a lot.

Our incredible air traffic controllers keep us safe every day even though they are forced to use this badly outdated system.  That is why we want to give them access to capital markets and investors so they can obtain the best, newest, and safest technology available.  And by the way, the new technology — and I’ve seen it — is incredible.

If we adopt these changes, Americans can look forward to cheaper, faster, and safer travel — a future where 20 percent of a ticket price doesn’t go to the government, and where you don’t have to sit on a tarmac or circle for hours and hours over an airport — which is very dangerous also — before you land.

Dozens of countries have already made similar changes with terrific results.  And we’re going to top them, actually, by a long shot.  Canada, as an example, modernized their air traffic control through a non-government organization about 20 years ago, and they have cut costs significantly, adopted cutting-edge
technology, and handled 50 percent more traffic — and actually, far more than that on a relative basis compared to us.

A modern air traffic control system will make life better for all Americans who travel, ship, or fly.  It will reduce cost and increase convenience for every American consumer — and these new efficiencies will produce a huge economic boost for the country, and for the 1 in 14 American jobs that aviation supports.

Today, we are taking the first important step to clearing the runway for more jobs, lower prices, and much, much, much better transportation.  America is the nation that pioneered air travel, and with these reforms, we can once again lead the way far into the future.  Our nation will move faster, fly higher, and soar proudly toward the next great chapter of American aviation.

Thank you.  God bless you.  And God bless the United States of America.  Thank you.  Thank you very much.  (Applause.)

China,11-10-2014 00:00,Li Keqiang,Set a New Example of Mutual Benefit and Win-Win Cooperation,"Your Excellency Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier,
Your Excellency Prime Minister Xavier Bettel,
Your Excellency President Martin Schulz,
Ladies and Gentlemen,

It is my great pleasure to attend the “Hamburg Summit: China meets Europe”. Known as the “City of Bridges”, Hamburg boasts a unique view with over 2,000 bridges. As I see it, Hamburg has even more intangible bridges that extend to the rest of the world. Hamburg has a time-honored tradition of free trade and had established the Hanseatic League back in the 13th century. Today, Hamburg is known to be the fastest transshipment port in Europe. In fact, one out of every three containers handled in the Port of Hamburg travels between China and Europe. This illustrates the long history and current dynamism of China-Europe exchanges.

The “Hamburg Summit: China meets Europe” 2014 has a rich program, including topics such as how China and Europe perceive each other, trade and investment order, urbanization in China, green growth, etc. I can see from the program that there is a great deal of anticipation for China-Europe cooperation. Cooperation requires more understanding of each other, so I wish to take this opportunity to brief you on the current state and future prospects of the Chinese economy.

Since the start of this year, in the face of a complex environment at home and abroad, the Chinese economy, under heavy downward pressure, has managed to maintain a stable performance on the whole. Its GDP grew by 7.4% in the first half of this year, a momentum that has basically continued into the third quarter. Although this figure is somewhat lower than China’s high-speed growth of about 10% in the past, it remains a medium-to-high growth rate. Worldwide, our growth rate is still high. Given China’s large economic size, the 7% increase in its economy today equals, if not exceeds, a 10% increase in its economy in the past. The increase is also equivalent to the size of a medium-sized economy.

In the beginning of this year and in recent months, there have been some small fluctuations in some of China’s economic indicators, yet the economy is still running within a reasonable range. It is inevitable to have some fluctuations, which also occurred last year. And the growth of other countries is not a perfect straight line either. We maintain that the Chinese economy needs to perform within a reasonable range. The growth target for this year is set at around 7.5%. I would like to draw your attention to the word “around”. This means that with adequate employment and relatively stable price levels, and as long as we could ensure parallel growth of household income and positive progress in protecting the environment, a growth rate slightly higher or lower than 7.5% would be considered acceptable. For the Chinese government, its focus is still on employment. Since the start of this year, although economic growth has somewhat slowed, employment has increased. From January to September, more than 10 million urban jobs were created, over 100,000 more than that of the same period of last year. Surveyed unemployment rate has stayed at around 5% in 31 big cities.

Economic growth is not a sprint but rather long-distance running that will never end. It demands certain speed. More importantly, it demands perseverance and staying power. The quality and efficiency of China’s economic growth is improving, something that we hope to see. With the continued rise of the proportion of the service industry, the rapid development of emerging industries such as e-commerce, logistics and express delivery, and the growth of high-tech industries and equipment manufacturing faster than the entire secondary industry, the adjustment and improvement of industrial structure has progressed by leaps and bounds. We have also seen encouraging results in energy conservation and emissions reduction. Energy consumption per unit of GDP was down by 4.2%, and carbon intensity down by about 5% in the first half of this year, the biggest cuts in years. With growing household income, consumer demand is also rising steadily. In particular, consumption by the general public is increasing rapidly. People have enjoyed tangible benefits in the course of economic development.

The Chinese economy has made these achievements thanks mainly to reform and innovation. Despite downward pressure on the economy, we have not adopted indiscriminate strong economic stimulus; nor have we ever eased monetary policy or expanded deficit. Instead, we have vigorously promoted reform in administrative, fiscal, financial, investment and other key areas and, at the same time, reformed and innovated the approaches of macro-control by promoting structural adjustment, namely targeted macro-control on the basis of range-based macro-control. Reform is also a stimulus on the economy, as it helps to improve both the micro-foundations and the macro-environment for economic growth, and could generate huge market vitality and social creativity. We have put in place a number of reform measures to incentivize market entities, strengthen weak links and boost the real economy, with an aim to release the massive dividend of reform for development.

Since the beginning of this year, the Chinese government has continued to spearhead a “self-targeted revolution” by substantially streamlining administration and delegating powers and promoting market-based reforms so as to boost the vigor of creation and innovation for more individuals and businesses. Since the adoption of reform on the business registration system last March, we have seen an over 60% year- on-year growth, a massive upsurge, in other words, on the number of newly registered market entities over the past six months and more. These new businesses, mostly small and micro-enterprises or players in the service sector, have generated more than 10 million jobs, and have become a new pillar of China’s economic growth thanks to their strong growth prospect. We have not only lowered the threshold of market access by offering much-needed policy support to these newly-established businesses, but also enhanced on-going and ex-post oversight, created a market environment featuring fair competition, and improved the social security network, so that those involved in entrepreneurship and innovation will have no additional worries and will grow healthily on the land we have fostered for them.

Speaking as I am, I think of a line from Goethe, which reads “If you want to love your own value, you must create value for the world.” Innovation and creation is the common ideal and pursuit of mankind. We have adopted these measures of reform and innovation so that the newly-born market forces will grow steadily, and that more people will see the hope and follow suit. In this way, we will see a massive wave of entrepreneurship and innovation by the people on the Chinese land. This wave will help everyone to grasp the opportunity of realizing the dream of greater accomplishments and a colorful life. It will enable us to turn our “demographic dividend” into “talent dividend” and improve income distribution and promote social equity, so that we could achieve sustained economic growth and all-round development of the people.

To ensure stable economic performance, we will be more proactive on the basis of maintaining overall policy stability. As a next step, we will further enhance reform and innovation. In addition to removing systemic obstacles, we will also address structural problems by strengthening weak links in development and in the real economy. For example, on finance and credit, we will make good use of both existing and additional resources to support the development of agriculture, rural areas, farmers, small and micro-enterprises, emerging industries and other forms of the real economy. We will continue to advance major livelihood and development projects such as railways in Central and Western China, renovation of urban run-down areas, water conservancy and pollution prevention and treatment, and make efforts to increase the supply of public goods. With the strong driving force of reform and innovation, we have every confidence that we could achieve the main targets for this year’s economic and social development.

The Chinese economy has been growing in a sustained and rapid manner for over 30 years, and it still has ample source of energy for future development. It has a bright prospect, thanks to its strong resilience of growth, as well as the huge market space and ample room for leverage. Many of you are old friends of the Chinese business community. As you may have noticed, China does have a number of advantages such as improved human resources, well-developed infrastructure, industries, capitals and technologies, and strong risk-resistance capability. Yet to know a country like China well, one also needs to see more than that, as China is a big country with over 1.3 billion people and there is uneven development between the urban and rural areas and among different regions. Much remains to be done before we could realize industrialization and urbanization. The broad space in China’s rural areas and inland provinces allows the economy to grow in an incremental and gradual manner, and these are where we find still a huge potential for development. As I see it, reform and innovation is the best “excavator” to bring out the potential. The diligent and hardworking Chinese people are making innovations on the system and science and technology development through their own wisdom, thus ensuring that the Chinese economy will maintain medium to high growth rate and move to the medium-and-higher end of growth.

China’s development is open development. The Chinese economy cannot develop without the world, and prosperity of the global economy also needs China. The Chinese economy will not head for a “hard-landing” as some have worried about. On the contrary, it will bear positively on the global economy, and serve as a significant force propelling world economic recovery. That, I believe, is conducive to China-Europe business cooperation and ensures mutual benefit and win-win outcomes in our cooperation.

China’s development requires a peaceful international environment and a stable neighboring environment. As the global political and economic environment remains complex, China makes a major force for upholding world peace, and China is committed to upholding stability and security at the regional level. China hopes that countries may join hands, respect and live in peace with each other and seek to achieve common development.

Ladies and Gentlemen,

I have visited Europe a number of times. Europe boasts a long history and splendid cultures and is advanced in economy, science and technology. As a major pillar of the world that carries strategic significance, Europe contributes in its own way to safeguarding world peace. Europe cares about China and has an interest in China, and I believe the same is true with China about Europe. We are heartened to see the positive results in Europe’s efforts to stabilize economy and regain its competitiveness. Important steps have been made towards the building of a banking union, and progress has been achieved in the structural reforms of the deeply indebted countries, with a notable drop of the treasury bond yields. We believe that Europe will emerge even stronger and more prosperous from the crisis.

Over the past four decades, the China-Europe relationship has grown from a seedling into a luxuriant tree that has borne rich fruits. Our political trust, economic cooperation and people-to-people exchanges have all scaled unprecedented heights. Since the establishment of diplomatic ties, trade between China and Europe has increased by over 230 folds. Every day, some US$1.5 billion worth of trade is being conducted between the two sides, which means that during the twenty minutes of my speech today, the two sides have already concluded trade deals worth tens of millions of US dollars. The bond of common interests between us makes China-Europe relations even more appealing and expansible, which gives us every reason to be confident in the future of China and Europe.

China and Europe are two major strategic forces. We both undertake the lofty mission of promoting global economy, advancing human civilization and progress and safeguarding world peace. The two sides are expanding their converging strategic interests. During his visit to Europe last spring, President Xi Jinping called on China and Europe to work jointly to build the four bridges for peace, growth, reform and civilization between the two sides and a China-EU comprehensive strategic partnership of greater global influence, which brought our relationship to a new height. We are ready to work with the European side to keep the development of our relationship on the right track and jointly set up a new model of mutual benefit and win-win cooperation in the world. China is the largest emerging market and the EU the largest developed economy. Nothing is impossible when the two “largests” converge. And strength will be multiplied if the “emerging” meets the “developed”. China-EU cooperation may serve as a fine example of that between the emerging and developed economies. China and Europe are located at the two ends of the Eurasian continent, the biggest landmass on earth and the most populous continent in the world with huge market and great development opportunities. Together China and Europe may contribute even more to promoting prosperity and development and achieving win-win and all-win development in Asia and Europe. Both sides call for greater democracy in international relations and we share common interests on many major international issues. Our relationship is acquiring more and more important global significance. The two sides may join hands in the course of promoting world peace and global governance. Both China and Europe enjoy splendid culture and the tradition of objective reasoning and speculative philosophy. While China advocates “harmony without uniformity”, the EU stands for “unity in diversity”. The 1.3 billion Chinese people and the 700 million European people have a common destiny and a common future. China and Europe may well take the lead in promoting mutual learning and inclusiveness between different civilizations.

Europe is committed to its integration process. No matter what may change in the international arena, China’s support to the EU will remain unchanged. We support Europe in seeking greater strength through unity and a bigger role played by the EU in international affairs. We also hope the EU will continue to understand and support the development path chosen by China that suits its own national conditions and continue to respect and accommodate China’s core interests.

Ladies and Gentlemen,

We live in the age of new technology revolution and industrial transformation. Both China and Europe are at a critical development stage and are faced with the common task of maintaining growth, readjusting structure and creating more jobs. To deepen the results-oriented cooperation is an objective need for both sides and both face rare opportunities in doing so. There is an old saying in China which goes, “You will surely see water coming out if you really dig deep enough”. We should indeed tap deeper into our cooperation potential the way we dig a well. Along that line, let me make the following proposals:

First, we should make a “grand strategy” to promote growth in trade. China and Europe together account for one third of the world economy, but our trade makes a mere 1.5% of global trade. Although we cannot simply draw a comparison between these two figures, this does speak to the huge potential of growth of bilateral trade. Such a potential is not just about larger scale but also about improved structure. Therefore, we need to make good planning in order to increase both the scale and quality of trade. During my current visit, our two business communities have concluded some US$10 billion of agreements, which include both trade of products and technical cooperation between the two sides. We have taken note of Europe’s plan to invest 50 billion euros in the building of transport, energy and digital networks. We hope that the European side will favorably consider using Chinese equipment in high-speed railway, nuclear power and other projects, as our equipment is low in cost but high in quality. We have long expressed concern over the issue of European high-tech exports to China, and we hope that the European side will give China fair treatment in effecting the upcoming reform of its export control regime. China and Europe should jointly oppose trade protectionism of all forms. We are ready to conduct consultations with the EU in search of an early consensus on the case of wireless communications equipment. The establishment of a China-EU free trade area will be a significant step for upgrading two-way trade, and the two sides may launch feasibility studies on it at an earlier date.

Second, we should take bilateral investment onto the “fast track”. Investment cooperation is the manifestation of the strategic nature of China-EU relations. China and Europe should seize the favorable opportunities, build on the strong momentum of investment growth, and support their companies in expanding investment in such areas as industrial development and industrial parks. The early conclusion of a China-Europe investment agreement will provide strong guarantee for mutual investment. The two sides need to speed up the negotiation process and work for early outcomes. We hope that the European side will create a more equitable and transparent business environment for Chinese companies investing in Europe, and provide China with more facilitations on market access, entry visa, work permit and other issues. China and Europe may also work together to explore market opportunities in third countries through joint investment and other means in order to deliver benefits to all sides.

Third, we should explore the “deep ocean” of cooperation on innovation. China and Europe are both committed to conducting structural reform and upgrading economic structure. This has provided new opportunities for us to expand cooperation in new technologies, new industries and new sectors. When I visited Europe in 2012, the two sides launched the mechanism of urbanization cooperation. This is an area where a lot could be achieved through cooperation on both the “hardware” and the “software” aspects. In the area of green economy, Europe has advantages while China has the market. We believe the two sides may jointly develop a group of demonstration zones on circular economy, energy conservation and environmental protection in order to maximize the catalytic and multiplying effect of our cooperation. The two sides may also make a joint effort to advance medium- to long-term cooperation in aviation and space, and strengthen cooperation in the operation, maintenance and management of rail transport systems.

People-to-people exchanges, like a decoder, serve to dispel misgivings and forge closer bonds between people’s hearts. I know that there is a food process engineer in the Rheinland-Pfalz State of Germany, who has visited China more than 250 times in the past thirty years and more. He has brought to China the technologies he knows, offered donations to areas hit by earthquakes, and provided funding support for school drop-outs. This friend of China called himself an “85% Chinese”. His story is a perfect showcase and epitome of China-Germany and China-Europe friendship. Now, more than five million people travel between China and Europe each year, and nearly 300,000 students are studying in each other’s countries. We need to further strengthen exchanges in education, science and technology, culture, sports and other fields, encourage cooperation between our cultural industries and in areas of products and services, and expand personnel exchanges, especially the interactions between our young people, so as to lay a deeper and stronger foundation for China-EU relations.

Ladies and Gentlemen,

China-Germany relations have always been at the forefront of China-EU relations. On this very day 42 years ago, China established diplomatic relations with the Federal Republic of Germany. Today, this relationship has become much more mature. During my visit this time, the two sides have issued the Program of Action for China-Germany Cooperation, which includes specific plans and measures for advancing bilateral cooperation in various areas over the medium and longer terms. We are ready to continue to work with the German side to take this relationship to a new height.

The Hamburg Summit has entered its tenth year. Over the past decade, the summit has made contribution to the growth of China’s relations with Germany and with Europe as a whole, and our friends present have also provided valuable insights for enhancing practical cooperation between the two sides. I wish to take this opportunity to express my thanks to you all. The summit is a place where we can gain new inspirations through the exchange of ideas. The Germans often say, “Faith can move mountains.” And back in China, we have a similar story about a “foolish old man” who is determined to remove mountains that block his way. In a world of both opportunities and challenges, faith in openness and in cooperation could help us overcome the distance of mountains and oceans and embark on a journey toward mutual benefit and win-win cooperation.

To conclude, I wish the summit a full success. Thank you.",Premier,Xi Jinping,https://www.fmprc.gov.cn/mfa_eng/wjdt_665385/zyjh_665391/t1202863.shtml,,INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS
USA,23-10-2019 00:00,Donald Trump,Remarks by President Trump on the Situation in Northern Syria,"THE PRESIDENT:  Well, thank you very much.  My fellow Americans, I greet you this morning from the White House to announce a major breakthrough toward achieving a better future for Syria and for the Middle East.  It’s been a long time.

Over the last five days, you have seen that a ceasefire that we established along Syria’s border has held, and it’s held very well, beyond most expectations.  Early this morning, the government of Turkey informed my administration that they would be stopping combat and their offensive in Syria, and making the ceasefire permanent.  And it will indeed be permanent.  However you would also define the word “permanent” in that part of the world as somewhat questionable, we all understand that.  But I do believe it will be permanent.

I have therefore instructed the Secretary of the Treasury to lift all sanctions imposed on October 14th in response to Turkey’s original offensive moves against the Kurds in Syria’s northeast border region.  So the sanctions will be lifted unless something happens that we’re not happy with.

This was an outcome created by us, the United States, and nobody else, no other nation.  Very simple.  And we’re willing to take blame, and we’re also willing to take credit.  This is something they’ve been trying to do for many, many decades.  Since then, others have come out to help, and we welcome them to do so.  Other countries have stepped forward, they want to help, and we think that’s great.  The nations in the region must ultimately take on the responsibility of helping Turkey and Syria police their border.  We want other nations to get involved.

We’ve secured the oil, and, therefore, a small number of U.S. troops will remain in the area where they have the oil.  And we’re going to be protecting it, and we’ll be deciding what we’re going to do with it in the future.

In any event, by the moves that we’ve made, we are achieving a much more peaceful and stable area between Turkey and Syria, including a 20-mile-wide safe zone.  An interesting term, “safe zone.”  That’s the term we’re using it.  Hopefully, that zone will become safe.  Thousands and thousands of people have been killed in that zone over the years.  But it’s been sought for many, many decades, and I think we have something that’s going to be strong and hold up.

Turkey, Syria, and all forms of the Kurds, have been fighting for centuries.  We have done them a great service, and we’ve done a great job for all of them.  And now we’re getting out.  A long time.  We were supposed to be there for 30 days; that was almost 10 years ago.  So we’re there for 30 days, and now we’re leaving.  It was supposed to be a very quick hit and let’s get out.  And it was a quick hit, except they stayed for almost 10 years.  Let someone else fight over this long-bloodstained sand.

I want to thank Vice President Pence and Secretary of State Pompeo for leading the American delegation so successfully to Turkey several days ago, along with National Security Advisor O’Brien.  I want to thank them very much.  The American delegation negotiated the original five-day ceasefire that ended [enabled] Kurdish fighters to safely leave.  It just got them to a point where, frankly, they were able.  It enabled them to get out, to go and move, really, just a few miles in a slightly different direction.  So this enabled them to do so.

Countless lives are now being saved as a result of our negotiation with Turkey — an outcome reached without spilling one drop of American blood.  No injuries.  Nobody shot, nobody killed.

I have just spoken to General Mazloum, a wonderful man, the Commander-in-Chief of the SDF Kurds.  And he was extremely thankful for what the United States has done.  Could not have been more thankful.  General Mazloum has assured me that ISIS is under very, very strict lock and key, and the detention facilities are being strongly maintained.  There were a few that got out — a small number, relatively speaking — and they’ve been largely recaptured.

I’m also sure that he will be issuing his own statement very shortly.  We had a great talk.  But we’ve saved the lives of many, many Kurds.  He understands that.  The war was going to be vicious and probably not very long.  And I’m very happy to have been involved in it, as are our Vice President, our Secretary of State, and all of the other people on our team.  By getting that ceasefire to stick, we’ve done something that’s very, very special.  But by getting the ceasefire after a tremendous amount of really tough war for a very short period of days, that is something very special.

Our troops are safe, and the pain and suffering of the three-day fight that occurred was directly responsible for our ability to make an agreement with Turkey and the Kurds that could never have been made without this short-term outburst.

Should Turkey fail to honor its obligations, including the protection of religious and ethnic minorities — which I truly believe they will do — we reserve the right to re-impose crippling sanctions, including substantially increased tariffs on steel and all other products coming out of Turkey.

We are now an economic powerhouse like never before, and, very importantly, like no other.  Our economic might is stronger than it’s ever been, and our competitors are not doing very well.

We also expect Turkey to abide by its commitment regarding ISIS.  As a backup to the Kurds watching over them, should something happen, Turkey is there to grab them.

Further, we implore European countries to come and take those fighters that the U.S. captured and bring them back to their countries for incarceration and for trial.  Until just recently, Europe has been very unresponsive in doing what they should have been doing for a long time.  Now is their chance to finally act.

American forces defeated 100 percent of the ISIS caliphate during the last two years.  We thank the Syrian Democratic Forces for their sacrifices in this effort.  They’ve been terrific.  Now Turkey, Syria, and others in the region must work to ensure that ISIS does not regain any territory.  It’s their neighborhood; they have to maintain it.  They have to take care of it.

There were some political pundits who responded to Turkey’s offensive in Syria by calling for yet another American military intervention.  I don’t think so.  But halting the incursion by military force would have required deploying tens of thousands of American troops against Turkey — a NATO Ally and a country the United States has developed a very good relationship with, including President Erdoğan.

The same people that I watched and read — giving me and the United States advice — were the people that I have been watching and reading for many years.  They are the ones that got us into the Middle East mess but never had the vision or the courage to get us out.  They just talk.

How many Americans must die in the Middle East in the midst of these ancient sectarian and tribal conflicts?  After all of the precious blood and treasure America has poured into the deserts of the Middle East, I am committed to pursuing a different course — one that leads to victory for America.

Through much work, we have done things that everybody said couldn’t be done.  Today’s announcement validates our course of action with Turkey that only a couple of weeks ago were scorned, and now people are saying, “Wow.  What a great outcome.  Congratulations.”  It’s too early to me to be congratulated, but we’ve done a good job.  We’ve saved a lot of lives.

Most importantly, we have avoided another costly military intervention that could’ve led to disastrous, far-reaching consequences.  Many thousands of people could’ve been killed.

The last administration said, “Assad must go.”  They could’ve easily produced that outcome, but they didn’t.  In fact, they drew a very powerful red line in the sand — you all remember, the red line in the sand — when children were gassed and killed, but then did not honor their commitment as other children died in the same horrible manner.  But I did honor my commitments with 58 Tomahawks.

Eight long years after President Obama’s ill-fated push at regime change, U.S. troops are still on the ground in Syria.  More than half a million people are dead, hundreds of thousands are terribly injured, and millions more Syrians are displaced.  It really is a nightmare of misery.

Across the Middle East, we have seen anguish on a colossal scale.  We have spent $8 trillion on wars in the Middle East, never really wanting to win those wars.  But after all that money was spent and all of those lives lost, the young men and women gravely wounded — so many — the Middle East is less safe, less stable, and less secure than before these conflicts began.

The same people pushing for these wars are often the ones demanding America open its doors to unlimited migration from war-torn regions, importing the terrorism and the threat of terrorism right to our own shores.  But not anymore.  My administration understands that immigration security is national security.

As a candidate for President, I made clear that we needed a new approach to American foreign policy, one guided not by ideology, but by experience, history, and a realistic understanding of the world.

We are building up America’s military might like never before, investing $2.5 trillion since my election.  But we will not be depleted.  We will not happen again.  It will not be allowed to happen again, where our military is depleted, fighting in areas of the world where we shouldn’t be.

When we commit American troops to battle, we must do so only when a vital national interest is at stake, and when we have a clear objective, a plan for victory, and a path out of conflict.  That’s what we have to have.  We need a plan of victory.  We will only win.  Our whole basis has to be the right plan, and then we will only win.  Nobody can beat us.  Nobody can beat us.

I want to again thank everyone on the American team who helped achieve the ceasefire in Syria, saved so many lives, along with President Erdoğan of Turkey — a man I’ve gotten to know very well and a man who loves his country.  And, in his mind, he’s doing the right thing for his country, and we may be meeting in the very near future.

I also want to thank General Mazloum for his understanding and for his great strength and for his incredible words today to me — but me just as a representative of the United States — because he knows that we saved tens of thousands of Kurds.  And we’re not talking in the long term, we’re talking in the short term.  We’re talking something that was going on immediately and something, frankly, that was planned for a long time.

The job of our military is not to police the world.  Other nations must step up and do their fair share.  That hasn’t taken place.  Today’s breakthrough is a critical step in that direction.

Thank you all very much, and God bless America.  Thank you.  Thank you.",President,Donald Trump,https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefings-statements/remarks-president-trump-situation-northern-syria/,,INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS
United Kingdom,14-Jun-11,David Cameron,PM's speech on the NHS,"Prime Minister Ten weeks ago we pressed pause on our NHS reforms. We wanted to speak to professionals, patients and everyone who cares about the NHS… …and make sure our proposals were absolutely right. Now there were those who said this was a humiliating U-turn, that we were back-tracking and ditching all our plans. And there were those who said the opposite… …that actually we weren’t going to change anything - that this was all a big PR stunt. Today we show that both are wrong. The fundamentals of our plans… …more control to patients, more power to doctors and nurses, less bureaucracy in the NHS… …they are as strong today as they’ve ever been. But the shape of our plans… …the detail of how we’re going to make all this work… …that really has changed - as a direct result of this consultation. We listened to what professionals and patients told us. You wanted us to make clear that competition isn’t there for its own sake, but to make life better for patients - done. You wanted us to get specialists - not just GPs - on commissioning groups - done. You wanted us to join up the different parts of the NHS, to put integration right at the heart of our reforms - done. We have listened, we have learned, and we are improving our plans for the NHS. We come here today with a substantive package of changes… …and for that I want to thank Steve Field, the Future Forum and everyone who took part. In a moment Nick and Andrew are going to say something about those changes… …but first I want to remind people why we’re doing this. Because behind all the talk about processes and policies there are people saying: ‘what’s the point of these plans?’ ‘What do they actually mean for me?’ Today I want to answer that. I want to set out the five big things these reforms mean for you. Free Health Service One, they mean the NHS you know and love is safeguarded and secured for the years ahead. We all know about the pressures on our health service. A population ageing so fast that the number of people over 85 is set to double over the next two decades. New drugs and treatments that are so expensive they add hundreds of millions to the bill each year. This is a monumental challenge for the NHS. Fail to reform now and we could see a bigger and bigger black hole opening up in the budget. Fail to confront this and the founding principle of the NHS - health care available to everyone who needs it, free at the point of use - would be in danger. I refuse to let that happen. Because of what we’re doing today, the NHS will continue to thrive tomorrow… …it will continue to be free at the point of use, based on need and not ability to pay… …and our children and grandchildren will be able to rely on it - just as we have done. Choice The second thing these reforms mean for you is greater choice… …the choice to get treated where you want, the way you want. So if you’re being treated for cancer and you want to have your drug treatment at home at a time that suits you - you should have that choice. If your child needs a wheelchair and you want to choose the supplier - you should that choice. If you’ve got problems with your heart and need regular tests - you should be able to decide when and where. This is your National Health Service, and we are going to put you in the driving seat. Access to the best Three, they mean you’re going to have access to the best. Because as well as giving you more choice, we’re giving you more information. Information on how hospitals are performing, on survival rates from operations, on patient satisfaction… …all there online for you to see. In this non-bureaucratic, patient-driven, clinician-led, open and transparent system… …you’re going to be able to seek out the best treatments there are. Of course what’s important to people isn’t just how and where they get treated but when they get treated. That’s why waiting times are online too. We are keeping the 18-week limit - and we will keep on measuring how long people have to wait in A&E. Be in no doubt that this government is pledged, determined, committed to keeping waiting times low. Breaking down barriers Four, these reforms will mean a smoother, more seamless journey through the health service. If there’s one big frustration a lot of people have, it’s that the NHS can seem a bit disjointed. You see different doctors at different appointments, all to talk about the same thing. Or your mother gets stuck in hospital when she wants to come home, because social services and the NHS aren’t properly joined up. Our plans are about breaking down these barriers… …with specialists from across the NHS talking to each other to get the best for you. And we’ll be exploring ways to bring the different pots of money together across health and social care. This might sound dry - but it’s going to make a real difference to people’s lives. Long-term conditions And five, these reforms will mean a big improvement in the way people with long-term conditions are treated. Today one in three people has a condition like asthma, arthritis or diabetes. They account for 70 per cent of spending on health. They are the biggest users of the NHS… …but frankly, the NHS hasn’t caught up. People routinely end up in hospital when their condition could have been managed at home. Patients have to check in with specialists when they’d quite happily monitor themselves. These reforms change all that. Putting spending power into the hands of doctors and nurses is going to make a radical difference to millions of lives. Why? Because together with your GP you’ll be able to design a package of care that fits into your life. So say you’ve got diabetes. With our changes, as part of your care planning you can talk to your GP about access to education and support so you can manage your own blood sugar levels… …something we know works, and which will help you reduce your chances of winding up in hospital to be stabilised when it gets too late. That’s good for you - giving you more independence and more control. And it’s good for our NHS - as we start to manage these long-term conditions much more effectively and efficiently. Conclusion So this is what we’re doing this for. Putting power in patients’ hands. Making sure everyone has access to the best. Making the whole system more seamless. Treating long-term conditions the right way, not the old way. Above all - safeguarding our NHS and everything it stands for. Ten weeks ago, we paused our legislation. Today, we show how we are improving it. Ten weeks ago, some of the people who worked in our NHS were sceptical of our changes. Today, we are taking people with us. It’s in this spirit of unity that we want to continue. We’re going to carry on listening and we’re going to carry on working together - for the good of our NHS.",Prime Minister,David Cameron,https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/pms-speech-on-the-nhs,,DEVELOPMENT
Russia,01-12-2004 00:00,Vladimir Putin,Speech at the First Session of the Council under the President for the Fight against Corruption,"Good afternoon respected colleagues,

We are holding the first session of the Council for the Fight against Corruption today. And I would like to describe its tasks in more detail.

Many countries, to some or other extent, have to deal with the problem of corruption. And a certain practice has already been worked out, while great experience in targeted anti-corruption policies has been accumulated. Entire systems to counteract this evil are in place.

The main form of corruption in Russia today is bribery. Meanwhile, corruption as a social manifestation is a far more complicated matter. Its consequences extremely negatively affect the most diverse spheres of state and public life, from the economy to morals.

It is obvious that corruption is closely linked with various forms of abuse of power. Moreover, this occurs at all levels. This comes in the form of all sorts of preferences for so-called close businessmen and the creation of extra-legal advantages when receiving state services and much more.

In essence, this means actions that lead to violations of equality and the very freedom of economic activity. They lead to the state failing to fulfil its obligations to guarantee honest competition.

As a result, citizens’ legal rights are violated, the economy’s normal development is held back and serious barriers emerge in the way of economic growth.

In general, corruption demoralises society, while it damages the authorities and the state apparatus. It is particularly unacceptable in judicial and law enforcement practice, in judicial and law enforcement bodies, for whom the fight against corruption is a primary function.

I believe that the main task of the council, as a consultative body, is to identify the reasons for and the conditions in which corruption spreads. And this is the basis for drawing up a systemic anti-corruption policy. This should be a policy that is reflected in both current legislation and in the organisation of enforcement proceedings.

I would like to stress once again: the roots of corruption lie in the very flaws of the organisation of the state’s economic and administrative life. Poor quality legislation cultivates these roots, while they spread due to the lack of effective control over the activity of officials, and bodies of state and municipal power.

As you know, the authorities in Russia have repeatedly and forcefully declared that corruption needs to be dealt with. Entire programmes have been drawn up, while individual, quite tough measures have been taken. However, I should say directly that they have not, unfortunately, had much effect.

The scale of this problem will only be reduced when the country sees the law, its institutions of democracy and the civilised market strengthened. And when the authorities will not only fight with the consequences of corruption, but also its causes.

Accordingly, I would like to set out the main priorities that, in my view, form the basis of our joint work.

Firstly, constant and systemic anti-corruption expert studies have to be conducted with regard to legislation. This applies to both articles that could lead to abuse and the very possibility of corruption in current laws and bills being prepared. The legal field has to be cleared of empty declarations, dual interpretations and internal contradictions. Laws should only include clear and realistic demands, as well as comprehensible mechanisms for their application.

Secondly, the council will have to become involved in work to analyse the activity of federal, regional and local bodies of power. I would like to emphasise that this does not mean interfering in the work of local authorities. I am speaking about analysing their activity. You know that the relevant commission has already been set up, whose results should not only influence the course of administrative reforms. I should reiterate that we have delayed this process, but also the definition of an anti-corruption component part of the state policy.

The execution of any administrative procedures should be as transparent as possible. Bodies of power have to part once and for all with the traditions of making state and municipal decisions outside the limits of budgetary and taxation legislation. And the budget and extra-budget funds established by the law must become the only way to receive and allocate money for the authorities.

The third area of our activity is the improvement of the state and municipal apparatus, the tough regulation of officials’ rights and obligations. A task connected with this is the creation of a working mechanism to settle conflicts of interests of state and municipal service officials. They need to be put within strict procedural limits, while the results of their work must be open to civil society, to people, in essence, taxpayers, who pay for the services of the state apparatus from their own pockets.

We should not be afraid, in my opinion, of improving the material situation, raising the wages of officials, but their activity should be transparent, open and absolutely understandable for society.

The council will have to form working commissions featuring specialists who know the problem and have great authority in the professional and public sphere.

The council should possess objective information about the scale of corruption and in which areas it has become the most entrenched. It should rely on clear legal criteria and appraisals. We must provide an exact definition of the very notion of “corruption” and understand what facilitates it in today’s conditions.

And, finally, my last point. The more effective and stronger the institutions of civil control are, the fewer chances to abuse power in the interests of personal and collective gain there will be. And, therefore, one of the council’s tasks is to work out effective forms of public control over state and municipal authorities.

We have already raised this subject repeatedly, but effectively working mechanisms of control have so far not been established. I would suggest that the council should put forward its own specific proposals in the form of legislative initiatives of the Government and the President of the Russian Federation.

In conclusion, I shall add that the period of the organisational formation of the council must be completed as soon as possible, including with regard to its expert and working mechanisms. Empty talk, any fuss or form of “campaigning” is totally unnecessary in this sphere and they must be consigned to the past.

On the contrary, precise and realistic measures are needed both to deal with instances of corruption and, most importantly, to prevent them. To fulfil this task and form, as I have already said, working bodies quickly, I propose that we appoint the council’s chairman today. I know that some of my colleagues are of the opinion that the chair should rotate for a period of six months. I agree with them. We shall do this. I propose that the council’s chairman for the first six months be Chairman of the Russian Federation Government Mikhail Kasyanov. If there are no objections, then let’s do this.

Now let’s talks about the formation of the two working commissions and determine who will chair them.",President,Vladimir Putin,http://en.kremlin.ru/events/president/transcripts/statements/22279,,OTHERS

Premier of the State Council of
The People's Republic of China
At the 22nd ASEAN Plus China, Japan and ROK Summit","Prime Minister Prayut Chan-o-cha,
Colleagues,

It gives me great pleasure to attend the 22nd ASEAN Plus Three (APT) Summit. On behalf of the Chinese government, I would like to express my sincere thanks to our host Thailand for its thoughtful preparations and arrangements for the Summit.

APT cooperation, which was initiated in the aftermath of the Asian financial crisis, has traversed an extraordinary journey. In the past 20 years and more, thanks to our joint efforts, the APT framework has continued to strengthen with expanding and deepening cooperation, contributing to the steady progress of regional economic integration. Deemed a successful example of multilateral cooperation, APT cooperation has delivered benefits to the countries and peoples in the region, and boosted economic growth in Asia and beyond. These hard-won achievements deserve to be cherished, and the valuable experience gained therefrom should be carried forward.

As we meet, the world is seeing profound and complex changes. Slowing global growth, sluggish trade and investment worldwide, and notably rising protectionism are shaking market confidence and posing new risks and challenges to the development of East Asian countries and APT cooperation. As underpinning forces for regional prosperity and stability, APT countries are duty-bound to strengthen unity and collaboration. Together, we must firmly stand for the international system with the UN at its core and the WTO-centered multilateral trading regime, vigorously advance regional economic integration, firmly pursue open and inclusive development with win-win cooperation, and tackle risks and challenges head on. This will help broaden our space of development and inject a fresh impetus into the steady growth of the regional and global economy.

Colleagues,

Given our diversity and strong economic complementarity, there exists a broad room for cooperation among APT countries. We need to further unleash the potential to seek more substantive progress in APT cooperation, and steer East Asian cooperation toward higher-quality development. In this context, I propose that we intensify our efforts in the following areas:

First, bringing economic integration to a higher level. Asia is one of the most economically integrated regions in the world. Most of the new free trade agreements since 2013 are signed mainly by Asian countries. APT countries, representing the bulk of Asia's economy, have a total trade volume of over US$10 trillion, almost half of which is intra-regional trade. With the ASEAN Economic Community realized, over 90 percent of tariff items in intra-ASEAN trade have been eliminated.

China, Japan and the ROK are ASEAN's important trade and investment partners. Last year, ASEAN's free trade arrangements with China, Japan and the ROK generated a total trade volume of close to US$870 billion, up by 6.8 percent year on year. And the three countries' investment in ASEAN countries grew by 10 percent to reach US$38 billion.

Thanks to the joint efforts of all parties, 15 RCEP participating countries have concluded text-based negotiations and essentially all their market access issues, and are committed to resolving the few outstanding issues by the end of this year, to make the agreement ready for signing at next year's RCEP Summit. This is a major breakthrough in building a free trade area in East Asia that covers the largest population, the most diverse membership and boasts the greatest development potential. The conclusion of the RCEP will strongly boost trade and investment liberalization and facilitation.

APT countries, accounting for a large part of the RCEP, have been strong supporters throughout the negotiations, and will be direct beneficiaries. As such, we should play a positive role in facilitating the signing of the agreement as soon as possible. The successful conclusion of the RCEP will put us at a new starting point, and make us more confident in speeding up the China-Japan-ROK FTA negotiations and building an industrial chain and specialization structure in East Asia based on our comparative advantages. These efforts will be conducive to fostering a higher level of economic integration in our region, and put us on course toward an East Asia Economic Community (EAEC).

Second, supporting regional connectivity. Connectivity is an important foundation for East Asian economic integration. China supports Thailand's proposal of issuing the APT Leaders' Statement on Connecting the Connectivities Initiative at this year's Summit, as it will help forge a synergy of our efforts in boosting regional connectivity. As a cooperation platform for common and inclusive development, the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) has drawn a strong interest from regional countries. Yesterday, ASEAN leaders and I issued the Joint Statement on Synergizing MPAC 2025 and the BRI. China is ready to work with all parties to enhance the synergy between the BRI and other regional connectivity initiatives, follow a high-standard, people-centered and sustainable approach and promote open, clean and green development. We need to strengthen cooperation on economic corridors and industrial parks, and improve institutional connectivity including that of market rules and standards, so as to promote interconnected and integrated development of regional countries.

Third, enhancing regional financial cooperation. Financial cooperation is a priority for the APT framework. Parties need to act on the vision set out in the Strategic Directions of ASEAN+3 Finance Process, and work to improve the regional economic governance architecture through financial cooperation and serve the need for regional economic integration.

The role of the Chiang Mai Initiative Multilateralization (CMIM) and AMRO needs to be fully leveraged to upgrade the regional financial safety net and build up East Asia's capacity to defuse financial risks and maintain steady economic growth. We welcome the completion of the first periodic review of the CMIM Agreement and support further efforts to explore using local currencies to make the CMIM safer, more effective and readily available. Meanwhile, the use of local currencies in regional trade and investment should also be increased. We support AMRO in strengthening its economic surveillance capacity. We suggest efforts be made to develop local currency bond markets, implement the new ABMI Mid-Term Road Map and mobilize more private capital in the region to invest in the infrastructure sector.

We also need to strengthen FinTech cooperation in joint research, information sharing and regulation. Last month, the inaugural meeting of the APT Inter-Bank Association was successfully held in Thailand, which will help further diversify financing channels in the region.

Fourth, promoting sustainable development. Over the years, APT countries have engaged in extensive cooperation on poverty reduction, aging and food security. China will work with other APT countries to implement the UN 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and share experience through the East Asia Cooperation Initiative on Poverty Reduction and further enhance APTERR.

China will do what it can to narrow the development gap and achieve common prosperity in the region through sub-regional cooperation frameworks, including the Lancang-Mekong and the China- BIMP-EAGA cooperation. We support the establishment of the APT Ministerial Meeting on Disaster Management and will be happy to host its first meeting next year. We will work with Japan and the ROK for cooperation with interested ASEAN countries under the ""China-Japan-ROK+X"" arrangement in a joint effort to pursue common progress in the region.

China supports cooperation on the digital economy, smart cities, artificial intelligence and e-commerce to deliver greater benefits of innovation and scientific and technological advances to the general public.

Fifth, deepening people-to-people exchanges. Close bonds between our peoples are key to smooth progress in cooperation. Recent years have seen a boom of people-to-people and cultural exchanges among APT countries, which are popular among our people. Cooperation frameworks on tourism, education, culture and press should be fully leveraged and the APT Cooperation Fund well used to sponsor more projects that enjoy the support of the people. The launch of the Network of APT Cultural Cities last month will boost cultural exchanges and cooperation among cities in the region.

China welcomes the establishment of the APT Website, which will help the general public better understand and appreciate APT cooperation. China will remain a good host of the APT Media Cooperation Forum and the APT Young Scientists' Forum to strengthen exchanges and mutual learning between cultures and deepen the understanding and affinity among our peoples.

The prosperity and development of East Asia requires an environment of peace and stability. As an immediate neighbor to the Korean Peninsula and a responsible major country, China has been a promoter of peace and stability, facilitator of dialogue and negotiation, and contributor to long-term security. China will continue to work with other regional countries and play a positive role in promoting political resolution of the Peninsula issue, denuclearization of the Peninsula and enduring peace in the region, and this process.

Colleagues,

This year marks the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China. Over the past seven decades, China has made remarkable progress in development owing to the hard work, wisdom and courage of the Chinese people, and in the course of its mutually beneficial exchanges and cooperation with the rest of the world. Going forward, China has the capacity to take good care of its own affairs and make new contributions to the common development of all countries.

This year, in spite of the complex international environment, the Chinese economy has, on the whole, registered steady growth and solid progress with major indicators performing within our expectations. GDP growth stood at 6.2 percent in the first three quarters of this year and is expected to stay in the range of 6 to 6.5 percent set out early this year. Close to 11 million urban jobs have been newly created, and the surveyed urban unemployment rate in September was 5.2 percent. International payments have been balanced overall with foreign exchange reserves remaining above US$3 trillion.

Structural adjustments are making steady progress. We have seen another bumper harvest of grains. The high-tech manufacturing and modern services industries have maintained fairly fast growth. An average of nearly 20,000 businesses are newly registered every day, maintaining a strong momentum of business growth. This testifies to the dynamism of entrepreneurship and innovation in society and the confidence of market entities. The per capita disposable income of urban and rural residents has been rising in sync with economic growth, the ecological environment is improving, and continued progress has been achieved in meeting people's basic needs.

These achievements have not been easy for China, particularly when its economy has surpassed US$13 trillion and major economies around the world are seeing a slow-down in growth. It once again proves the resilience, potential and vitality of the Chinese economy and our ability to fend off risks and challenges. The fundamentals sustaining China's positive economic outlook for the long term remain unchanged and will not change.

That said, due to the slowing global growth, the Chinese economy is also facing difficulties and challenges amid mounting downward pressure. Fully anticipating the complex and challenging situation at home and abroad, we have made comprehensive preparations and responded with proactive measures.

As the largest developing country in the world, China has intensified its efforts to promote a new type of industrialization, IT application, urbanization and agricultural modernization through deepening reform and opening-up. This process has generated stronger driving forces from within and promises unlimited potential for future development.

China has a 900 million-strong work force, a talent pool of over 170 million with higher education or professional skills, and more than 100 million and still growing market entities. We have a huge market of nearly 1.4 billion people with fast upgrading consumption demand, a full-fledged industrial system with a growing innovative capacity, and well-established infrastructure. All these constitute a strong underpinning for China's growth.

In the meantime, the host of major policies and measures we have taken are paying off. For example, the larger-scale tax and fee cuts adopted early this year have effectively slashed 1.53 trillion yuan worth of taxes and fees in the first eight months of this year. And the amount for the whole year is expected to surpass 2 trillion yuan. Such cuts will help relieve burdens on businesses, invigorate market entities and counteract the downward pressure.

Furthermore, we have stepped up efforts to nurture a world-class, market-oriented business environment governed by a sound legal framework and provide a level playing field for businesses of all types of ownership, domestic and foreign-invested alike. In the first three quarters of this year, despite the sluggish flows of FDI globally, foreign investment in China grew by 6.5 percent year on year. It shows that foreign companies remain optimistic about China and about making investment in China.

Besides, with a large toolkit and sufficient policy reserves for macro-regulation at our disposal, we are confident about meeting the main targets and goals for this year's economic and social development, laying a solid groundwork for the coming year.

China is a friendly neighbor to all countries around the table, ASEAN, Japan and the ROK. China's development will first and foremost benefit its neighborhood. Last year, all ASEAN countries, Japan and the ROK participated in the first China International Import Expo (CIIE), ranking among the top in terms of products exhibited and transaction value. The second CIIE, which will be even larger in scale, is to open in Shanghai shortly. China looks forward to the active participation of your countries.

Looking ahead, no matter how the external environment may change, China will stay committed to the path of peaceful development and all-round opening-up. We will share development opportunities with the people around the world, jointly foster an open world economy, and build a community with a shared future for mankind.

Colleagues,

As APT cooperation now enjoys stronger popular support, a more solid basis and greater opportunities for further development, China will, together with all parties, make APT cooperation a major engine for regional economic integration and contribute more to the long-term prosperity and stability of East Asia.

Thank you.",Premier,Xi Jinping,https://www.fmprc.gov.cn/mfa_eng/wjdt_665385/zyjh_665391/t1713331.shtml,,DEVELOPMENT
United Kingdom,16-May-11,David Cameron,Speech on the NHS,"Six weeks ago, we announced a pause in our plans for the modernisation of the health service. Since then there’s been a whole flurry of debate. Column inches have been written. Concerns aired. Passions raised. That goes to show something I’ve known all along: that the NHS is the most important thing to Britain’s families. Well, let me tell you this. It’s the most important thing to my family too. That’s why, over four years ago, I got up on a platform like this and said that you could sum up my priorities in just three letters, N-H-S. Since then, if anything, the feeling has got stronger. My determination to deliver a first-class, world-class health service - that’s got stronger. My determination to make sure the poorest people get the best care - that’s got stronger. My determination to protect the core principle of the NHS… …that all have access to healthcare regardless of their wealth…that’s got stronger. That’s what fires me - and I know that’s what fires everyone else. We have an institution - a precious idea - that says we are in this together; looking out for each other. So this government will never, ever take risks with the NHS. We will make it better. That’s why, despite all the financial constraints, we are protecting the NHS budget from cuts. This year, and the year after, and the year after that, NHS funding will increase in real terms. What’s more, since we’ve come to office: We have introduced a new cancer drugs fund, helping 2,000 patients get access to drugs they would have previously been denied. We have cut the number of times a patient has been placed in mixed-sex accommodation without justification by half. We have kept up the pressure on hospital-acquired infections, reducing the number of cases of MRSA and C Difficile. And for the first time in a long time, we have made sure the number of doctors in our NHS is growing while the number of bureaucrats is actually falling. But I know that some people still have concerns. They might be listening to this and thinking… …OK, but if you love the NHS so much, if you don’t want to take any risks with it, why do you want to change it? But this is the point: It’s because I love the NHS so much that I want to change it… …because the fact is the NHS needs to change. It needs to change to make it work better today and it needs to change to avoid a crisis tomorrow. Let me take each of those points in turn. Change needed today First, we need change to make it work better today. I know that as soon as I say this there’ll be people lining up, accusing me of talking down the NHS. I’ll say it again - I love the NHS. And yes, in many ways the NHS is providing the best service it ever has. Waiting times for tests and treatments have dropped dramatically and access to cutting edge technologies like primary angioplasty is becoming common-place, saving thousands of lives. But I’m sorry - I just do not think we do anyone any favours… …not the patients who use our health service, the professionals who work in it or the taxpayers who pay for it… …if we deny that there are problems with the way the NHS works today. I’ve been to hospitals and surgeries up and down the country… …I’ve spoken to consultants, nurses, midwives, physios, GPs… ….I receive a vast mailbag from patients, both as a constituency MP and as Prime Minister… …and this is the resounding message I’ve got: “Yes, we love the NHS but yes, there are some real problems.” There’s the problem of waste and inefficiency. This isn’t just about the one-off cases we’ve all read about… …like the £400,000 one health authority spent on a yacht. It’s the way the system can encourage over-spending. If a hospital doesn’t balance its books, year after year… …then that hospital will be bailed out and subsidised by the surpluses taken from other hospitals which have kept within their budget. If there is one health authority that invests money into the prevention of diseases like diabetes… …and another that is poor at prevention, has poor quality outcomes and overspends… …then money is snatched from the former to prop up the latter. Then there’s the problem of too much top-down control, stopping doctors and nurses from doing what they know is best. Today we have the situation where a GP and an orthopaedic surgeon can both see an elderly person having problems walking… …both recommend a knee operation… …and both be over-ruled by someone who has never met the patient. We have a commissioning process where a tier of management, who sit above doctors, are in charge. Yes, these managers do important and valuable work. But they’re not on the frontline so sometimes, they don’t know precisely what local patients need. Don’t take my word for it. Last year, the Health Select Committee said “Primary Care Trust commissioning is widely regarded as the weakest link in the English NHS”, citing their “lack of clinical knowledge” in particular. This is what top-down control is doing to our NHS - and I believe it should change. Then there’s the inflexibility of the NHS - and this is what frustrates so many patients, and indeed nurses and doctors. The mother who wants to give birth in the big county hospital but have her scans done more locally… …she’s told no - because of the contracting arrangements between different hospitals she’s got to go where she’s told. The woman who needs surgery, who knows there’s a great private hospital just down the road, where they’ll do her operation at NHS standards and at NHS costs… …but she’s told no - she’s got to go to a specific NHS hospital, that could be miles away, because that’s where she was seen before. I was sat in a surgery in Birmingham last week, listening to the doctor explain that he has world-class physiotherapists in the same building… …but he can’t refer his patients to them because the current system stopped it. This is frustrating enough, but add to it to the lack of co-ordination and integration. Modern healthcare needs to be joined up, but we have a system today where different nurses and doctors sometimes have to start from scratch when they each see the same patient. We have a system where different elements of a patient’s care - primary or secondary - can occur in isolation to one another. This doesn’t just cause stress and inconvenience, it’s just not conducive to delivering the best quality healthcare possible. And quite apart from these frustrations, patients also have to tolerate disparities in the service offered in one part of the country to another. Whether it’s the quality of care people experience, the type of treatment available, or the outcomes achieved… …too much comes down to luck and where people live. In Britain today, we have some great, world-leading, groundbreaking hospitals. Take the Royal Marsden, which will soon go live with CyberKnife, the latest in radiotherapy technology. But in other hospitals, in other parts of our country, patients are treated with much less sophisticated equipment. And in some parts of the UK, you are three times more likely to die of a stroke than in others. I don’t think people should have to put up with this unfairness. We have a duty to do what we can to close the gap between the best and the rest. As Lord Darzi, the last government’s Health Minister, said: we need to ensure high quality care for all. Now some people say that some inefficiency, some hassle, some disparity in service are just the price you pay for a health system like ours. But look abroad and you’ll see that’s not the case. I’ve listened to doctors and I know how much they care about getting good outcomes - and I know the statistics tell a better picture than we in this country sometimes get credit for. We’re getting better, and in some cases we’re closing the gap with our European neighbours, but we’ve still got some way to go. If we had cancer survival rates at the average in Europe, we’d save 5,000 lives a year. If we had respiratory disease care equivalent to the average in Europe, we’d save 2,000 lives a year. If we could prevent and treat chronic liver disease and cirrhosis as well as the European average, we could save 550 lives a year. We’re approaching the European average spending on health. I just think it’s time we had the confidence to say we should have some of the best health outcomes in Europe too. Saying this doesn’t make you anti-NHS… …it makes you pro-NHS - because you want to make things better for everyone. Modernise today or crisis tomorrow So that’s the first reason we need change - to make the NHS better today. The second reason is that if we don’t modernise now, we face a crisis tomorrow. The NHS is facing enormous financial pressures in the years ahead - driven by rising demand and the cost of new drugs and technologies. Let’s take demand first. That’s in part down to the achievement of our health system - people are living longer. For the first time ever there are more pensioners in this country than children under 16. And the number of people aged over 85 is set to double in the next twenty years. Just think about what that will mean. Every hour the NHS deals with more than 25,000 people… …think how many of them are elderly, and then consider with our population ageing at the rate it is… …how those numbers could rise dramatically. And the type of care and treatment they need is changing too. In the old days, healthcare was often about lifesaving treatment at a moment of crisis. So, responding medically to heart attacks and strokes. Treatments for diseases like cancer. Today, the big killers of the past are becoming the lifelong conditions of the future. Between 1978 and 2008, the death rate from coronary heart disease fell by over seventy-five percent. That is fantastic news for families - indeed for our whole country - but there are clear financial implications. Already three quarters of the health and care budget goes on long term chronic conditions - and the pressure is going to get bigger. In just eight years, the number of people with three or more long-term health conditions is set to rise by thirty per cent. Indeed, by 2050, the number of over sixty-fives with one or more long term conditions is expected to rise by 252 per cent. But these demands on our health service are not just driven by an ageing population. For while we are living longer, in many ways we are also becoming less healthy. Obesity and poor diets. Drug and alcohol abuse. These public health challenges are getting bigger and bigger. Take obesity: it already costs our NHS a staggering £4 billion a year. But within four years, that figure’s expected to rise to £6.3 billion. Already we can see the impact of all these rising pressures. For example, 2, 700 more planned operations are carried out on a typical day than was the case just four years ago. That is the truth of the rising demand the NHS is facing. But it’s not just increasing demand. It’s also about the rising cost of treatment. The overall cost of medicines has been growing on average by nearly £600 million a year. A lot of this is driven by new treatments coming on stream. Ten years ago no one had heard of the cancer drug herceptin. Now it is widely available for the women who need it - at a cost of almost £100 million a year. For diabetes, the cost of newer treatments meant drug costs rose by £200 million over five years - that’s an increase of forty-two percent. Timely interventions with effective new drugs and treatments can of course save money. But when a new gene test can costs thousands and when robots costing millions are increasingly the right option for complicated surgery, the pressure on costs far outstrips any potential efficiencies. And it’s not just the pressure from the increasing use of existing technologies. Right now scientists are working on artificial limbs that are controlled by thought alone. Breathalyzers that can diagnose disease with one puff. Kidneys grown in laboratories from stem cells. A world class health service demands these advances. Our NHS and its patients should get them. But that will only happen if we find a sustainable way to deal with the rising costs. Sticking with the status quo and hoping we can get by with a bit more money is simply not an option. If we stay as we are, the NHS will need £130 billion a year by 2015 - meaning a potential funding gap of £20 billion. The question is, what are we going to do about that: Ignore it? No - because we’d see a crisis of funding in the NHS, over-crowded wards and fewer treatments. Borrow more so we can chuck more money at it? No - because we can’t afford to. Ask people to start paying at the point of delivery for it? No - because as I said, the NHS must always be free to those who need it. There’s only one option we’ve got - and that is to change and modernise the NHS… …to make it more efficient and more effective - and above all, more focused on prevention, on health, not just sickness. We save the NHS by changing it. We risk its long-term future by resisting change now. Deep down even Ed Miliband knows this. That’s why he said “to create an ever better health service, change will be essential.” Listening exercise So this is the consensus: no change is not an option. But we have to make sure it is the right change, delivered in the right way. Change needs to go to the heart of the current problems I have described… …and the future challenges I have set out. It must tackle the waste and the bureaucracy by reducing the overlapping layers we have today. It must put the patient centre stage, giving them choices and chances that they are currently denied. It must promote prevention and a healthier nation, which must mean giving GPs… …who are our first contact with the system and have a good understanding of their area’s health needs… …a wider role. It must tackle the longstanding and damaging divide between health and social care, including the bed blocking that still afflicts so many of our hospitals. It must assist with the challenge to increase efficiency, raise productivity and keep costs down so we can go on meeting everyone’s needs. Change must do all these things… …but change - if it is to endure, to really work - should have the support of people who work in our NHS. We have to take our nurses and doctors with us. They provide the care, they know what’s best for patients… …so we want to work with them, not against them. Already, a significant number are on board with what we propose. Last week, GPs representing 1,100 practices across England, caring for over seven million patients, wrote to The Daily Telegraph expressing their wholehearted support for our reforms to commissioning arrangements… …arguing they will benefit the most vulnerable in society. But we recognise that many doctors and nurses have concerns about what we’re doing. That’s why at the beginning of last month, we decided we should pause, listen, reflect on and improve our NHS modernisation plans. And since then, that’s what we have been doing. In the past six weeks, I’ve sat with staff in hospitals in Frimley, Reading and Darlington… …have held events in the country’s largest hospitals like the Queen Elizabeth in Birmingham and smaller ones like Chipping Norton too… …and had meetings with voluntary bodies, community care providers and GPs. What’s more the NHS Future Forum, the independent organisation charged with overseeing the listening process… …and which is led by Professor Steve Field and includes other eminent clinicians, patient advocates and voluntary sector representatives… …has met more than 4,000 people. These meetings have been open, frank, productive - above all meaningful. We are listening - and we will make substantive changes to improve the reforms, based on what we hear. I do not want to pre-empt what those changes will be. The NHS Future Forum is due to report its recommendations at the beginning of next month, and we will issue our response later in June. But it is clear for example, that when people working in our hospitals hear the term ‘GP commissioning’, they worry it’s only GPs that are going to be involved in making decisions. Now that’s not the case, but I agree we need hospital doctors and nurses to be much more closely engaged in commissioning. But whatever the results from this listening exercise, let me be clear about the reform package that will emerge: There will be choice for patients, not competition for its own sake. Innovation and improvement, not breaking up efficient and integrated care. It will be evolutionary, not revolutionary. Our changes are a logical extension of tried-and-tested policies initiated by governments of all parties in recent years. Clinical commissioning has existed in one form or another for the past two decades. Payment by results, and Foundation Trusts, for the best part of the past decade. Working with others from the independent sector too - that’s not new either. The NHS has a long history of this - be it with social enterprises, charities or private companies… …and the last government in particular understood the importance of introducing an element of choice to drive up standards. The difference is that we plan to make these changes effective across our NHS. As I said: evolution, not revolution. That’s why, when I think about what our NHS will look like in five years time, I don’t picture some space-age institution, a million miles away from what we have now. Let me make clear: there will be no privatisation… …there will be no cherry-picking from private providers… …there will be no new upfront costs people have to pay to get care. Absolutely not. These are red lines we will not cross. Instead, our NHS will be much like what we have today. The values and ethos of our NHS that you care so much about - and Andrew Lansley and I care so much about… …they will still be there. You’ll still be able to call your local surgery, and speak to a receptionist you know to book an appointment with a GP you trust. You’ll still be able to go through the doors of an A&E in an emergency, and be seen by a nurse or doctor quickly and effectively. Your parents will still get the healthcare they need, from specialists and nurses on wards or in their homes. And let me repeat: all this will still be free, to those who need it, when they need it. It will be the NHS you love and recognise - only better. You will have much greater choice of where you are treated, and how you are treated. You’ll also see much greater co-ordination and integration between nurses and doctors and between surgeries and hospitals So if you have diabetes, professionals will work closely together with you to manage your condition from diagnosis onwards. In our NHS, nurses and doctors won’t be passengers, they will be drivers, supported by managers rather than in conflict with them. They understand the needs of patients, they know what’s needed… …so they will have new powers to transform patient care in a way that’s simply never been possible before…. …they will have the money and the freedom to complement their expertise and knowledge. So if local GPs see that there is a significant need for more respiratory services in their local area, they will be able to organise local clinics for their patients… …rather than making them travel to a hospital miles away. If nurses feel that they can deliver better care to autistic children in partnership with a local charity, they will find it much easier to make this happen. Ours is a vision of a stronger, more responsive NHS. An NHS with consistent, high quality care for all - instead of just pockets of excellence. An NHS which addresses the full needs of each person - of their physical and mental health… …rather than offering a piecemeal or patchwork approach. An NHS free-from-political control, where what matters is the care you receive not the headlines governments get… …where a new and independent National Commissioning Board, staffed with senior doctors and professionals, takes responsibility for what services are provided, outcomes are achieved and how well money is spent. A genuine National Health Service, rather than a National Sickness Service… …with a greater focus on outcomes and on improving public health - so people don’t get sick and ill in the first place. A NHS which makes people healthy - and keeps them healthy. Conclusion Let me end by saying this. It’s been a year since the coalition came together in the national interest. And we take those two words - national interest - very seriously. We are two different parties, with different identities, bound by one common cause - to do what is good for the country. And we don’t just have the will… … with a full five year Parliament to work with, we also have the opportunity to really tackle the long-term problems that have dogged our country. So that’s what we’re doing. Clearly cutting the deficit isn’t pain-free - but it’s in our country’s interest to bring sense to our public finances. Reforming welfare isn’t easy - but it’s right that as we help those who genuinely cannot work, we make sure those who can, do. Changing our education system isn’t popular with some parts of the establishment - but we have to do it if we’re going to give every child the best start in life. And it’s that commitment to act in the national interest which means we will also modernise our NHS. Believe me, it would have been so easy for me to stand on a platform like this and pretend - everything is fine, we can carry on as we are, nothing needs to change. But that would be a complete dereliction of duty. It would run completely counter to the purpose of this coalition - to act in our country’s interest. Sticking with the status quo is not an option. That may not be easy on the ear, but it’s the truth. The NHS needs to change - so that’s what we’ll do. Working with professionals, taking time to listen and improve our proposals… …we will make sure we build a strong, sustainable and better NHS… …free to all who need it. That’s my commitment. That’s my promise. That’s what acting in the national interest means.",Prime Minister,David Cameron,https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/speech-on-the-nhs,,DEVELOPMENT

Weekly Address: A Balanced Approach to Growing the Economy in 2013"," Hi, everybody. 

In the coming weeks, we face some important decisions about how to pay down our debt in a way that grows our economy and creates good jobs – decisions that will make a real difference in the strength and pace of our recovery. 

We began this year with economists and business leaders saying that we are poised to grow in 2013.  And there are real signs of progress:  Home prices are starting to climb again.  Car sales are at a five-year high.  Manufacturing is roaring back.  Our businesses created 2.2 million jobs last year.  And we just learned that our economy created more jobs over the last few months than economists originally thought. 

But this week, we also received the first estimate of America’s economic growth over the last few months.  And it reminded us that bad decisions in Washington can get in the way of our economic progress.   

We all agree that it’s critical to cut unnecessary spending.  But we can’t just cut our way to prosperity.  It hasn’t worked in the past, and it won’t work today.  It could slow down our recovery.  It could weaken our economy.  And it could cost us jobs – now, and in the future. 

What we need instead is a balanced approach; an approach that says let’s cut what we can’t afford but let’s make the investments we can’t afford to live without.  Investments in education and infrastructure, research and development – the things that will help America compete for the best jobs and new industries. 

Already, Republicans and Democrats have worked together to reduce our deficits by $2.5 trillion.  That’s a good start.  But to get the rest of the way, we need a balanced set of reforms. 

For example, we need to lower the cost of health care in programs like Medicare that are the biggest drivers of our deficit, without just passing the burden off to seniors.  And these reforms must go hand-in-hand with eliminating excess spending in our tax code, so that the wealthiest individuals and biggest corporations can’t take advantage of loopholes and deductions that aren’t available to most Americans. 

2013 can be a year of solid growth, more jobs, and higher wages.  But that will only happen if we put a stop to self-inflicted wounds in Washington.  Everyone in Washington needs to focus not on politics but on what’s right for the country; on what’s right for you and your families.  That’s how we’ll get our economy growing faster.  That’s how we’ll strengthen our middle class.  And that’s how we’ll build a country that rewards the effort and determination of every single American. 

Thanks.  And have a great weekend.",President,Barack Obama,https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/the-press-office/2013/02/02/weekly-address-balanced-approach-growing-economy-2013,,DEVELOPMENT
USA,20-11-2019 00:00,Donald Trump,Remarks by President Trump Before Marine One Departure,"THE PRESIDENT:  So, thank you very much.  We’re going to Austin, Texas.  Apple is opening up a fantastic facility.  They’re spending a tremendous amount of money.  And I’ve been asking Tim Cook from the day I got elected — from the campaign, I’ve been asking Tim Cook to, if they would, we want to see Apple build here; that way, you have no tariffs.  There’s no tariffs.  When companies come to our country and they build, there’s no tariffs.

The economy is doing unbelievably well.  We continue to talk to China.  China wants to make a deal.  The question is: Do I want to make a deal?  Because I like what’s happening right now.  We’re taking in billions and billions of dollars.

I’m going to go very quickly — just a quick comment on what’s going on in terms of testimony with Ambassador Sondland.  And I just noticed one thing, and I would say that means it’s all over.  “What do want from Ukraine?” he asks me, screaming.  “What do you want from Ukraine?  I keep hearing all these different ideas and theories.”  This is Ambassador Sondland speaking to me.  Just happened.  To which I turned off the television.

“What do you want from Ukraine?  I keep hearing all these different ideas and theories…What do you want?”  “What do you want?”  “It was a very short and abrupt conversation” that he had with me.  They said, “He was not in a good mood.”  I’m always in a good mood.  I don’t know what that is.  He just said — now he’s talking about what my response.

So, he’s going: ‘What do you want?  What do you want?  I hear all these theories.  What do you want?’  Right?

And now, here’s my response that he gave — just gave. Ready?  You have the cameras rolling?  “I want nothing.”  “That’s what I want from Ukraine.”  That’s what I said.  “I want nothing.”  I said it twice.  So, he goes — he asks me the question: “What do you want?  I keep hearing all of these things.  What do you want?”  He finally gets me — I don’t know him very well.  I have not spoken to him much.  This is not a man I know well.  Seems like a nice guy, though.  But I don’t know him well.  He was with other candidates.  He actually supported other candidates — not me.  Came in late.

But here’s my response.  Now, if you weren’t fake news, you’d cover it properly.  I’d say to the Ambassador in response:  “I want nothing.  I want nothing.  I want no quid pro quo.  Tell Zelensky” — President Zelensky — “to do the right thing.”  So here’s my answer: “I want nothing.  I want nothing.  I want no quid pro quo.  Tell Zelensky to do the right thing.”  Then he says, “This is the final word…from the President of the United States.”  “I want nothing.”

Thank you, folks.  Have a good time.  I’m going to Texas.",President,Donald Trump,https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefings-statements/remarks-president-trump-marine-one-departure-77/,,INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS
Russia,21-03-2014,Vladimir Putin,Expanded meeting of the Interior Ministry Board,"Friends,

The Interior Ministry has undergone a lot of change and modernisation over the recent years. A modern legal base has been established and human resources methods and approaches are changing too. The Ministry’s central organisation has been optimised, as have regional branches, and the level of technical resources has also increased substantially.

Of course, it would be impossible to achieve truly radical change overnight in such a complex and multifunctional system as the Interior Ministry. A large number of internal problems had built up, as you all know. But the state authorities, and more important still, the public want to see improvement take place at even faster pace, want to see quality results that will make their effect felt on the country as a whole and on people at the individual level.

I am sure that the Ministry has the administrative, professional and human resource potential needed for achieving these important objectives. In this respect, I want to note once again the well-coordinated work that the Interior Ministry and Interior Ministry forces carried out during the Olympics and Paralympics in Sochi, and also during the World Student Games in Kazan.

Colleagues and friends, I want to thank everyone in the Interior Ministry and its forces who ensured security at these big events. I thank you for your professionalism, responsible approach, discipline, and your respectful attitude towards the guests, athletes, supporters, and the people of Sochi.

In many respects you not only ensured security but also created a positive atmosphere at these events. You gave a clear demonstration of what our law enforcement agencies can accomplish, including in terms of swift response and good coordination with other agencies and services and with the regional authorities.

I think it is important that we now take this positive experience and build on it, including in the big organisational task that is the establishment of branches of our law enforcement agencies in Crimea and Sevastopol, in accordance with our country’s laws.

The Minister and I were talking just now: the Ministry, jointly with the Presidential Executive Office, has prepared corresponding documents and draft presidential executive orders so that we can recognise military ranks, service records and diplomas for Interior Ministry staff members who used to work in Crimea and Sevastopol. This will allow us to formalise many of their documents so they can work. We must resolve all these issues as efficiently as possible with material and social provisions for Interior Ministry staff in Crimea and Sevastopol.

Colleagues, I would like to outline the priority challenges faced by the Interior Ministry in the near future and in the long-term.

The most important among them remains the protection of citizens’ legal interests and resolutely combatting crime. I will note that last year, we saw a continued trend in the decrease of registered crime numbers, including serious and particularly grave offenses.

This trend has continued in Russia over the last seven years, and it is certainly a good result. The number of registered property offences has decreased by 7% and the number of burglaries has dropped by over 10%.

At the same time, the overall number of crimes committed remains significant. So far, we have been unable to increase the crime detection rate. The share of unsolved crimes in Russia is nearly 44%; I want to draw your attention to this figure. It carries serious criminogenic risks, is detrimental to the department’s authority and, indeed, to the entire system of power; it leads to a lack of faith in justice, the power of the law and the inevitability of punishment for criminals.

We need to turn this situation around, first and foremost by increasing the quality of operative investigation and criminal procedure work, at all levels: from the neighbourhood branch to the central headquarters, and build more effective cooperation with other law enforcement agencies.

It is also imperative to react immediately to alarms and calls from people, identify and investigate them, without allowing delays, run-arounds, buck-passing and other types of heartless, bureaucratic attitudes toward this work, or even direct violations of the law and service standards. I am asking managers at all levels to monitor this very strictly and thoroughly.

An important area of your work involves decriminalising the economy and participating in the creation of a healthy business climate. I will note that compared to 2012, we have seen a nearly 20% drop (a little over 18%) in the number of economic crimes.

Incidentally, these indicators are directly related to fundamental changes in our legislation and law enforcement practices by interior affairs agencies. I feel that in the future, we must also consistently eliminate various opportunities for unfounded meddling by law enforcement agencies in economic affairs and disputes between businesses.

At the same time, we must be more active in cases when the interests of citizens, businesses and the state are genuinely threatened, including corporate raiding and unlawful financial operations, the embezzlement of public funds and corruption. It is imperative to use new approaches that will allow us to effectively identify such crimes in the early stages and thoroughly prepare the evidence.

Another priority is ensuring public safety, first and foremost by reducing the level of crime in public places, on the streets, and in our cities’ and towns’ courtyards.

The Federal Law On Citizen Participation in Maintaining Public Order should be very helpful in this work. It was submitted to the State Duma on your initiative and its goal is to engage volunteers who wish to help the police maintain order. Incidentally, most federal constituent entities have similar laws, which work effectively.

Our approach to preventing crime requires some serious adjustment. We have addressed this topic many times, putting a lot of effort into building a corresponding state system. At the same time, it is clear that the system’s legal and methodological framework must fully correspond to modern demands.

The time has come to update many of the stipulations that create the legislative backbone of this system, paying particular attention to minors and individuals in difficult situations.

We will need to improve the efficiency of neighbourhood police. Their assignments and responsibilities are very extensive, and their area of work is certainly difficult and quite complex. It is important to release them from non-core functions and allow them more time to be involved in their direct duties.

Citizens should know the faces of their neighbourhood police officers, as they did in the past, and police officers should have a good understanding of the problems faced by their territory and its residents, including the risk groups, and be aware of the latest information. In many cases, this information allows them to identify criminals more quickly. For example, statistically speaking, in nearly one quarter of burglaries, the criminal’s identity was discovered with the help of neighbourhood police.

Furthermore, there are serious risks associated with uncontrolled migration flows. Last year’s data analysis shows that the number of crimes committed by foreign nationals – first and foremost, citizens of CIS nations – grew by 10%.

Clearly, in addition to the existing decisions aimed at establishing order in the field of migration – and I want to stress that this is not some sort of campaign, this is serious work aimed at improving the situation in this sphere – we need to consider an additional set of measures for effectively preventing such crimes and using combined knowhow, strategic information and assistance from our colleagues in CIS nations.

The same approach needs to be applied in countering illegal migration and building closer coordination – first and foremost with security agencies, the migration services, bailiff offices – in order to identify and intercept groups organising illegal migration, giving particular attention to territories adjacent to the border.

The fight against extremism remains one of the most important objectives of the Interior Ministry. Statistics show that such crimes have increased in the past year, and this poses a serious threat to our entire society. I have already said this and I want to repeat it: it is unacceptable to close our eyes and underestimate anyone’s extremist actions.

Your professional duty is to emphatically fight against all manifestations of xenophobia, nationalism and religious hatred, work to prevent extremism among young people, and use all of the Interior Ministry legal and organisational opportunities to intercept hate speech and radical propaganda, including online and through other information technologies and resources.

As experts, you are well aware that there is a direct link between extremist and terrorist groups, and here, the Interior Ministry must also work actively with colleagues from other security agencies and services with the National Anti-Terrorism Committee serving as a coordinator.

I want to stress that the responsibility of all officials related to anti-terrorist security will only grow and increase – in order for us to finally nip this very serious threat to our nation in the bud.

There is another issue I would like to touch on separately: road safety. You know, we have toughened penalties for speeding and drunk driving, and adopted a whole range of federal and regional programmes; we have increased the technical equipment of the state traffic police several-fold, and practically all the main highways are equipped with video cameras. However, the number of traffic incidents is not decreasing. Moreover, the number of accidents involving drunk drivers increased by nearly 6% compared to 2012; there were over 13,500 such accidents, which is a very worrying figure.

I want to stress that every such incident should be treated as extreme, and perpetrators should be subject to the strictest measures provided by the law. And, of course, we need to raise the standards of behaviour on the road. Government agencies, public organisations, civil society groups and the media should all be involved in this work

Colleagues, one of today’s priorities is strengthening the Interior Ministry’s human resources. It is important to ensure consistency in appointing administrators, taking a principled approach to the professional and personal qualities of staff at all levels. We need to continue training and preparing the pool of high-potential managers, at both the federal and regional level. We must increase the level of internal discipline and require managers to be held accountable for the actions of their subordinates.

For its part, the government will help create good conditions for serving in the Interior Ministry. We will continue to equip units with modern equipment, transport, weapons and means of communication, increasing employees’ salaries and their level of legal and social protection.

As you know, budgetary expenditures for the maintenance of the Ministry and interior forces have been growing in recent years. I will also note that over the past two years, there has been a noticeable increase in Interior Ministry staff salaries. Housing is still an issue, and funding is being allocated for purchasing and building housing, and we will increase the availability of this programme as finances allow.

In conclusion, I would like to wish the Interior Ministry and interior forces staff success in their service. I am confident that you will continue to fulfil all the objectives before you conscientiously.

Thank you for your attention. Good luck!",President,Vladimir Putin,http://en.kremlin.ru/events/president/transcripts/statements/20624,,OTHERS
Russia,23-12-2017,Vladimir Putin,United Russia Party congress,"Friends, colleagues, 
Many of you present here today took part in building the United Russia Party. We did it at a complicated and critical stage in the life of our state, when the nation needed a powerful unifying force for its steady development, for strengthening its statehood and addressing large-scale challenges. The United Russia Party has achieved and continues to achieve this goal. I am very pleased to note that and would like to thank you for that. 
United Russia has earned its leading position by real actions in the interests of the people, to the benefit of our regions, and to the benefit of the whole country. The people of Russia and all of us have walked down a hard but monumental road of development. We did not sidestep from the designated track and responded well to the challenges of the hardest trials and crises, including global ones, often completely out of our control. We stood together in countering the assault of international terrorism, in standing up for Russia’s independence and self-reliance, and we showed unity in deciding the fate of Crimea and Sevastopol.
We turned around seemingly insurmountable trends in the economy, demographics and social sphere. We ensured Russia’s enhanced security and growing influence in the world. Huge infrastructure projects and large-scale construction sites, new enterprises and advanced industries are the results of our joint work.
If we managed to achieve anything, the credit definitely goes to the Russian people, their will, labour, confidence, sometimes sacrifices, faith in patriotism as a key idea, belief in their Motherland. All that is the decisive force behind our progress 
Yes, we realise that we could have achieved more. This is always the case when one takes up the most difficult tasks, when one sets ambitious goals. And it is clear that if such super tasks are set, we can be sure from the onset that we may fail in some areas. But it is much worse when such ambitious goals are not set. Then nothing will come out at all.
At the same time, we must honestly identify unresolved issues and persevere in solving them, removing everything that impedes progress. We must set even more ambitious goals and achieve results. There are many urgent things we must work on. What has been done is just the foundation but not a guarantee of further successful development. The future depends on our ability to ensure that changes are irreversible, to preserve and considerably augment what we have achieved over the past years.
I would like to emphasise, to draw your attention to the fact that the irreversibility of achievements and changes means our readiness to respond to global challenges, to defend Russia’s statehood and people’s lives and security from threats and shocks, and to lay the foundation for growing prosperity for everyone. 
Everyone must be ensured a worthy place in the future. We must keep opening up broad opportunities for the success and self-fulfilment of each individual. Securing such continuity, sustainable and uninterrupted development of the nation is the main responsibility of all the constructive and visionary political and social forces.
It means that despite all the differences in opinions, approaches and proposals on developing the country, we must be guided by the citizens’ rights and freedoms, Russia’s long-term interests and the strength of our statehood. We can succeed in implementing our plans only on condition of general national accord.
For our country to live, to be revived, to preserve its identity, we must protect the basic values existing in society. They are patriotism, mutual understanding, concord between the peoples of our multi-ethnic nation, and respect for our history, culture, traditions, freedoms, rights and the dignity of man.
These values fortify our resolve to work for the common good and fuel the energy of volunteer activities. Caring, selfless people make an invaluable contribution to solving specific issues. They do not wait for somebody else to come and do it for them.
People’s responsibility, their participation in devising and implementing the development agenda is the basis for a strong and mature civil society, and undoubtedly, for a stable political and state system.
Stability must not meat inertia, stagnation, or a frozen petrified structure that lags behind the challenges of the time. If it were like that, everything could collapse at any moment and expose the country to the risk of destruction and dissolution, as it happened in our recent history.
We remember those lessons of history and that is why we keep developing our state and political system, making it more flexible, capable of adapting to the rapid changes of the modern world. The ability to meet the demands of people and society, their growing desire to actively participate in the life of the country – these are the things that we should be guided by. 
I would also like to stress that nothing undermines stability and steals the resource of development as much as untruth, injustice, lawlessness, the rust of corruption and bribery, indifference to one’s own country and distancing oneself from people’s needs, whether displayed by politicians, officials, businesses or those who call themselves “the elite.”
All these things weaken and undermine sustainable development, our social solidarity and stability. Let me underscore this – it is these matters, not people’s fair demands to solve outstanding problems.
It is my conviction that we should further expand the mechanisms of direct democracy, fully release the potential of civil activities laid in our Constitution, encourage the competition of ideas, proposals and approaches to solving development issues. We must have a respectful attitude towards competent and responsible opposition. And being such opposition means not only the wish and readiness to argue with the authorities or to accuse them of every mortal sin. We are aware of the problems the country is facing. Being responsible means having a clear-cut programme of positive action.
Let me emphasise that I see the key guarantee of the irreversibility of change in a strong, responsible, free civil society, as its structures operate for the sake of creation, for the good of the people and the country, and take part in addressing the most complicated social issues.
Such society rejects populism and idle talk. Such a society is resistant to any attempts to destabilise it. It will never let the country be dragged into chaos, be led astray, made weak and dependent. We know that such examples are plentiful in many countries around us. It can happen very fast if we are not committed to stability in society.
Colleagues, the irreversibility of our development largely ensures the firmness of Russia’ sovereignty and the combat capability of its army and navy. Our strength is directed at defence from external threats, from terrorism. We are not and will not be looking for confrontation with anyone. We will continue to pursue an open and honest foreign policy, we will strengthen the Eurasian Economic Union with our partners, and promote our initiative on establishing a new broader integration contour – the Grand Eurasian Partnership. We are ready to work with all countries – both in the West and in the East, on the principles of trust and equality. Yet we will never sacrifice the security of our citizens and our national interests (Applause).
For our people, for Russia to carry on, we must overcome the drastic aftermath of the demographic gaps the country faced last century, to preserve, and in the future to increase the country’s population . This is what our new additional measures on the support of motherhood, childhood and families with children are targeting. I would even say that the whole policy, all our work – in the economy, social sphere and other fields – should be aimed at preserving the nation, at solving the issues of demographic development.
That means modern healthcare and promoting a healthy active lifestyle, decreasing the mortality rate and increasing life expectancy in the coming years. It means new schools, crèches and kindergartens; creating a modern environment for living in cities and rural areas; good environmental conditions, modern infrastructure, utilities and roads; comfortable quality housing that is affordable for millions of Russians. Finally, it simply means people’s wellbeing and welfare – it consists of all of the above. We must achieve continuous stable growth of real incomes for our citizens, as well as pensions and social benefits.
We must certainly continue our efforts to decrease the number of people with incomes below the subsistence level, eradicate poverty, decreasing its level and the number of low-income people, which is a threat for the stability and unity of our society as it denigrates people. The situation should become intolerable when a person who has a good profession and qualifications gets a meagre wage for his or her work and literally lives from hand to mouth.
Let me remind you in this connection that we should certainly not adopt populist policies, give promises that cannot be kept or squander money the way it was done in the 1990s. We remember that under the pressure of circumstances Parliament and the Government often approved decisions that could never have been implemented; then they did nothing and took on new obligations that were never met either.
This is a path that we must certainly avoid. We remember what it led to. It led to 40 million people living below the poverty line in 2000, which was almost one third of the population back then. Today the figure stands at 20 million, and this figure too is unacceptably high.
We had a period when the figure stood at 15 million but, unfortunately, crisis effects, external restrictions and falling demand for our traditional exports in the world markets did their dirty deed. But now Russia has recovered from the recession, we have reached the stage of sustainable economic growth, and we must target poverty by taking advantage of the economic growth and labour productivity. We must do it the way we targeted inflation, and we have managed to achieve positive results, as you know. We must do the same in this case.
It is vitally important to radically change this situation, as people’s wellbeing, the wellbeing of their children and families, their social perception and confidence in the future are a guarantee of sustainable, progressive development of the country. I am sure that we can and must ensure conditions for every person regardless of age or any restrictions to be able to raise their qualifications, open their own business or have a good job.
What must we do to achieve that? We must establish a new employment market and a flexible modern system of vocational training.
Economic crises, and as I have already said, and external restrictions did not allow us to fulfil the task of reaching an economic growth above the world’s average. But it is imperative that we do it, and we will. Russia must not only secure a place among the world’s top five economies, but also approach the level of the advanced countries in terns of GDP per capita. It is this indicator that shows the quality and technological level of the economy, labour productivity and ultimately people’s wellbeing.
To achieve that, we will have to drastically modernise the country’s infrastructure, which is a top priority task for the short term. Raising efficiency and labour productivity in the traditional branches of the economy, making a breakthrough here similar to the one underway in agriculture, transport and communications, telecommunications, the pharmaceutical industry and the military-industrial complex of Russia.
Our successful large and growing companies should enter the world market and become global champions. Meanwhile, the top political, economic and social priority for the coming years remains the development of small and middle-sized business.
Russia must become a space of true economic freedom for every individual who has his or her own business, for tens of thousands of new startups, small family businesses, farms, self-employed entrepreneurs. This is also a guarantee of the irreversibility and sustainability of our development. We have to establish most favourable conditions for efficient labour, investment, business initiatives, to remove artificial barriers and unfounded restrictions. We will certainly pursue this work in the future.
I believe it important to continue improving and liberalising the existing legislation, including by dropping all the vague, ambiguous, unclear legal norms that are used by corrupt law enforcement officials to harass businesses, to force them to pay up and defraud them of their property.
Of course, we should develop fundamentally new industries. This is crucial, there can be no future without it. Industries related to the introduction of advanced digital and industrial technologies, bio-engineering, robotics. The branches are already shaping the future of modern civilisation and must ensure our country’s sustainability, progress and standing in tomorrow’s world.
Science and education play an enormous role here. Russian schools must be among the world’s best in terms of quality and scope of training, and our colleges, vocational schools and universities must adopt leading standards in training workers, engineers, researchers and specialists of the new technological paradigm.
We focus on developing the abilities and talents each child, each young person has. Work skills contests and grants for young researchers, support of gifted school and university students, the Sirius educational centre and the whole constellation of children’s techno parks, creative groups – all these projects are united by a common aim. This network must continue to expand. It is much too narrow today.
This means a successful future for the nation, its development that will be ensured by the strong, creative, talented and bright young generation of Russians. The key is that young people in large cities and small towns, in the countryside and in villages should have equal opportunities for self-fulfilment.
Only then will we ensure that strong young professionals enter politics and business, government agencies, industries, and all other spheres. Patriotic, honest, daring, committed, active people who understand and share the country’s development agenda and participate in its implementation, who consider it to be their own agenda which meets their dreams and aspirations. We must do all we can to ensure such continuity. Young people are the people of the coming new age. I am sure they will firmly stand up for Russia’s interests, will lead the country along the path of progress, leadership and prosperity.
Friends, Russia is made up of millions of very different people with their joys, hardships and problems. They toil, work, make families, and raise children. And it means our centuries-old history goes on. Our joint work, determination, energy and responsibility for Russia’s present and its future is the most reliable guarantee of its dignified, breakthrough, irreversible development.
I am confident of our success because millions of Russians are with us. We are together, we are moving forward. And there is certainly no power that can stop Russia’s forward movement. We will make our way from one victory to another. This is sure to happen!
<…>
Friends, Mr Medvedev, colleagues, 
I cannot but say a few words, literally a few words. 
Russia is a country with a thousand-year history. But we should not treat it as a beloved granny – give her medications on time so that she does not have any pains, and do nothing else. Not at all.
We must make Russia young, focused on the future, and it is becoming like that with every new generation. But to achieve that we must resolve all those issues that we have just spoken about. We must introduce significant changes in the development of healthcare and education, in infrastructure, because without healthcare and education we will not solve another key task – bringing innovation into our economy, developing digitalisation, biotechnology and so on, the things Mr Medvedev has just spoken about in his speech. This cannot be done by people who are not healthy or educated. All that is closely interconnected in the modern world.
There are very many people, both here, among this audience, and those who are not here but who support us, who do their job, working on the ground, as we say. They know that these tasks cannot be resolved with slogans and catchwords alone or just by handing out money to someone at a certain political stage without caring about what will happen tomorrow. This is a road to nowhere. United Russia has always been a very responsible political force and it has always had a professional approach to tackling the challenges facing the country. 
What does that mean? It means – and I would like to address those who are responsible for taking concrete decisions in Parliament and locally – it means that by identifying development tasks we must make timely decisions, however debatable they might seem at the time when they are taken.
We must shed everything that stands in the way of Russia’s renewal – we have a lot of things accumulated here – everything that stands in the way of making it young, forward-looking and driven. All that must be identified and discarded. We must create mechanisms that will let us move forward. 
Everyone knows that we need funding to solve the tasks we have spoken about. Where can we get it? Do we have funds or not? We do, but we have to make a lot of adjustments to the tax system, we have to absolutely and categorically ensure the development of the pension system so that current retirees and those who will retire in the future can be confident that everything is reliable and stable in that area.
We must continue to ensure the country’s defence capability. We have a great many tasks, and we must act responsibly and professionally, basing our actions on the long-term prospects of the country’s development rather than on the present-day situation. The key issue here is the ability to explain to the people what is being done and for what purposes, and what we are expecting to achieve. In that case, the people will support us, and we will be able to rely on them. And if something goes wrong, we have to say clearly, honestly and sincerely, “Yes, we wanted it that way but it turned out otherwise; we can see that and we will rectify it with your support and with your help.” 
This is the only way to achieve what I spoke about at the end of my speech. Only in that case will we be able to march from one victory to another. I really count on your support, thank you very much for it. 
Thank you.

Russia,06-12-2004 00:00,Vladimir Putin,Speech at the Russia Day Celebrations,"Dear friends,

Dear citizens of Russia,

I congratulate you on the state holiday of Russia Day.

Today it is celebrated by everyone who puts their own work, creativity and efforts into the prosperity and power of our country.

Here, on Red Square, people of different generations are gathered. Representatives of all regions of our enormous country have gathered here. Together, we are responsible for the destiny of Russia. And hand in hand, we are building a free and democratic state. We want to see out country as an influential and leading nation of the world.

And in this difficult task, we are to a large extent given strength by the thousand-year unity of the peoples of Russia. We are helped by the experience and achievements of our predecessors.

Today, we already know our abilities well, and make active use of them. In recent years, we have achieved difficult, important milestones: we have united and strengthened the country, increased its economic potential, and strengthened the international position of our nation.

Our policy remains unchanged on developing real federalism, and a strong and influential civil society. And now, these are not just aspirations or ideals. They are increasingly becoming the norm of our new life, of real practice.

We aim to ensure that the talent and abilities of each person in the country are in demand. So that power at all levels serves citizens’ interests fairly, and is not just effective, but responsible to people.

By taking this path, we have chosen the values of patriotism, freedom and democracy. And for us it is clear that the more active people’s initiative is, the richer the country will be. The more reliably citizens’ interests are ensured, the stronger the Russian state system will be.

Dear friends,

Before us there are new and serious tasks in the economy, and in social and political life. And now we already have real opportunities to solve the most urgent, serious and large-scale social problems.

As we tackle them, we remember that Russia has always triumphed and achieved success when our nation, our people and our society were united. When national tasks become the business and concern of every citizen of Russia.

In Russian society, this constructive mood is now prevalent. And today, on Russia Day, I would like to say: I believe that this mood and our civil solidarity will help to achieve the goals set. And the life of every person in the country – both in large cities and in the provinces – will finally become worthy and prosperous.

Happy Russia Day!",President,Vladimir Putin,http://en.kremlin.ru/events/president/transcripts/statements/22504,,NATIONALISM
USA,13-11-2015,Barack Obama,"
Remarks by the President in Meeting on the Trans-Pacific Partnership","As many of you know, this weekend I will be leaving for my trip to the G20, and then from there I’ll be taking my annual trip to Asia -- meetings with the ASEAN countries through the East Asia Summit.  Economically, the Asia Pacific region is the most dynamic, the most populous and fastest-growing region of the world.  And strategically, it is a region that’s absolutely vital to our economic and national security interests in the 21st century.

We’ve been working hard to increase the U.S. presence and focus in the Asia Pacific region.  We are a Pacific power.  Some of our closest alliances are in this region.  And we do an enormous amount of business, but there’s a lot more potential business to be done.  And if we’re going to continue to succeed in securing our nation and our allies, then we’re going to have to be a player and help establish the economic and security architecture in that region for this century and the centuries to come.

I believe, and I think that we have some of the most accomplished national security experts and military officers in our presence here today -- and they believe that our economic prosperity and our national security cannot be separated.  And if we are going to be a serious player in this critical region of the world, then we’ve got to get the economics right and we’ve got to get the national security right.  That’s why all of us agree that the Trans-Pacific Partnership agreement that we have forged is so important and that it is critical for Congress to act. 

The 12 nations that are party to this agreement represent 40 percent of the world’s GDP.  And our goal throughout this agreement has been to raise the standards, raise everybody’s gains in a way that it advantages America’s workers, American businesses, American farmers, American ranchers.  The results of this agreement are an elimination of tariffs -- taxes, effectively -- on American products and American services being sold into this region.  We’re already largely open to them, but they often have been closed to us.  We’re changing that.  

We’re making sure that labor standards and environmental standards are observed there, just like they are here, so that we create a level playing field, and they don’t have the ability as effectively to undercut U.S. workers and U.S. businesses who are following higher standards by using child labor, for example, or dumping their pollution in the oceans in ways that U.S. businesses can no longer do.

We’re making sure that intellectual property is protected, because a lot of what we produce has a lot of intellectual content.  We’re the software creators.  We’re the innovators.  And if folks in these countries are able to just duplicate what we do and all the research and development that’s gone into it, then over time our economic primacy will be eroded.  

And the good news is, is that these countries recognize that America is, in fact, going to be in the region for a long time.  They’re the partner that -- we are the partner that they want.  And this agreement reflects the kinds of high standards that we’ve been shooting for.  

The key now is for us to get this thing done.  And I am honored to have the individuals sitting around this table.  People like Henry Kissinger, who first opened up the U.S. relationship with China after decades of hostility.  Individuals like former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Mike Mullen, who understands very well what our national security needs are in the Pacific.  Folks like Jim Baker and Colin Powell, who have served in a variety of capacities as Treasury Secretary, as Secretary of State, both in uniform and out of uniform.  All of them saying that this is critical to get done for the U.S. economy, but it’s also critical for America’s national security.  

And one of the things that we all agreed on, as we’ve discussed the issue here today, is that if we fail to get the Trans-Pacific Partnership done, if we do not create the architecture for high-standards trade and commerce in this region, then that void will be filled by China, it will be filled by our economic competitors.  They will make the rules, and those rules will not be to our advantage.

So the time is for us to get this done.  We’ve now put the text out.  It is available for everybody to read.  We are consulting closely with members of both parties in Congress.  And we strongly believe that on a bipartisan basis we should get this done.  As soon as the 90-day review period is completed and the new session of Congress begins after the Christmas break, I’m hoping that leaders in both parties and both chambers move promptly to get this done.  It will be good for American business, it will be good for American workers, it will be good for our national security for generations to come.

Thank you very much, everybody.",President,Barack Obama,https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/the-press-office/2015/11/13/remarks-president-meeting-trans-pacific-partnership,,INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS
United Kingdom,05-Nov-20,Boris Johnson,Prime Minister's statement on coronavirus (COVID-19): 5 November 2020,"Good evening everyone, Across the whole United Kingdom, people are engaged in a huge joint effort to put the coronavirus back in its box. Throughout the pandemic, this government has done whatever it takes to protect lives and livelihoods – in England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. We have put in place an unprecedented package of economic support, protecting the wages and jobs of millions of people. We have built the largest testing capacity in Europe, with 32 million tests conducted so far and over half a million tests now available every day across the UK. We have ensured that, as we head into winter, the NHS has at its disposal over 30,000 ventilators and billions of items of Personal Protective Equipment, most of it now manufactured here in the UK. Across the whole of the UK, we have a shared goal – to suppress the virus, ensure the NHS is not overwhelmed, and in doing so to save lives. The UK Government and the devolved administrations are working together on a joint approach to the Christmas period, because all of us want to ensure families can come together wherever they live. The challenges we face are significant across the U.K. The average number of new cases each day is now 22,398, that’s up from 9,716 a month earlier. There are now 12,320 patients in hospital, up from 2,602 a month earlier. 1,142 patients are now in mechanical ventilation beds, up from 369 a month earlier. Sadly 492 deaths were reported yesterday. The weekly average number of deaths each day is now 295, up from 53 a month earlier. That’s why new restrictions are in place in each part of the UK. In England, from today, we are once again asking you to stay at home. As I explained on Saturday you can only leave home for specific reasons: for work if you can’t work from home, for education, and for essential activities and emergencies. The full rules, all of the details, are available at gov.uk/coronavirus and on the NHS Covid-19 app – please log on to see what you can and can’t do. I know how tough this is: For staff in the NHS and care homes, who are facing a tough winter on the frontline. For families, who can’t meet in the way they would want to. For businesses, forced to shut just as you are getting back on their feet. I know many of you are anxious, weary and quite frankly fed up with the very mention of this virus But I want to assure you this is not a repeat of the spring. Schools, universities and nurseries are all staying open. And these measures though they are tough are time-limited. The advice I have received suggests that four weeks is enough for these measures to make a real impact. So these rules will expire, and on 2 December we plan to move back to a tiered approach. There is light at the end of the tunnel. We have better treatments and techniques to take care of those in hospital, thanks largely to the ingenuity of British scientists. Rapid testing is being rolled out on a massive scale – with city-wide testing starting tomorrow in Liverpool. I am hugely grateful to the people of Liverpool for their participation in this pilot. I hope that by working together, we can get that great city on top of the virus. More broadly, there is also the very real chance of safe and effective vaccines. So taking those things together, these scientific advances can show us the way ahead. And in the meantime, the government will continue to support people affected by these new restrictions. As you know, we have protected almost 10 million jobs through furlough, and as the Chancellor announced earlier today, we are now extending the scheme through to March. We are also extending our support for the self-employed, so that the next payment increases to 80 per cent of average profits. We’re providing cash grants for businesses who are closed, worth more than £1 billion every month. We are giving £1.1 billion to Local Authorities in England to support businesses. And a further £2 billion of funding is guaranteed for Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. As we face these challenges together, we must look after those in most need. As of September we have helped over 29,000 rough sleepers off the streets, two thirds of whom are now in settled accommodation. Today we’re announcing a further £15 million to help councils offer safe accommodation for people who are sleeping rough or at risk of becoming homeless. This programme will help areas that need additional support most during the restrictions and throughout the winter. These are difficult times. And while it pains me to have to ask once again for so many to give up so much, I know that, together, we can get through this. So please, for the next four weeks, stay at home, protect the NHS and save lives. I’ll now hand over to the Head of NHS England Simon Stevens who’s going to talk about the NHS’s preparations for winter.",Prime Minister,Boris Johnson,https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/prime-ministers-statement-on-coronavirus-covid-19-5-november-2020,,DEVELOPMENT
Russia,18-08-2008,Dmitry Medvedev,Statement on the Situation in South Ossetia at the Meeting with Veterans of the Battle of Kursk," You know that we have always been a peace-loving country. Practically at no time in its history did Russia, the Soviet Union, or modern Russia ever start hostilities. But even the most peace-loving country has to have combat-ready armed forces. You know the well-known saying that he who does not want to feed his own army will end up feeding someone else’s. We cannot allow this to happen.

We do not attack anyone. On the contrary, in a number of cases we are protecting the lives and dignity of people, our citizens and foreign citizens, through our presence as peacekeepers in different countries, including in states that emerged following the collapse of the Soviet Union.

I think it is absolutely clear to you that if someone thinks they can kill our citizens in impunity, kill our soldiers and officers who are peacekeepers, this is something we can never accept. Anyone who tries such a thing will meet with a crushing response. We have all the possibilities we need for this: economic, political and military. If anyone had such illusions a while ago, the time has now come to part with them.

We do not want any escalation in the international situation. We simply want respect, respect for our country, our people and our values. And we use our peacekeeping forces to ensure these decisions, to help our citizens and also those who are not Russian citizens but face a difficult situation.

There is no historical precedent for the aggression launched by the Georgian authorities 10 days ago. It goes beyond all understanding when a seemingly civilized country, whose armed forces have been modernized by another, highly developed country, uses its military machine against civilians (who, incidentally, it sometimes still considers its own citizens) and peacekeepers. We cannot allow this. I repeat that there can only be one answer to such actions. ",President,Dmitry Medvedev,http://en.kremlin.ru/events/president/transcripts/statements/1121,,INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS
China,19-06-2020 00:00,H.E. Wang Yi,"Adhering to the Path of Solidarity, Cooperation and Win-win Results","

Dear Colleagues,
Friends,
Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, Director-General of the World Health Organization,
Mr. Achim Steiner, Administrator of the United Nations Development Programme,

Welcome to the High-level Video Conference on Belt and Road International Cooperation.

COVID-19, with its wide-ranging impacts, is posing a challenge to mankind rarely seen before. To defeat the virus and tide over this crisis, the world must come together in solidarity, partnership and cooperation. For this reason, China initiated this High-level Video Conference on Belt and Road International Cooperation. We hope that at such a trying time, a message of unity and cooperation from Belt and Road partners will bolster our confidence in promoting Belt and Road cooperation and in defeating the virus.

Since President Xi proposed this initiative in 2013, thanks to the active participation and strong support of all parties, the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) has kept growing in both depth and substance. It has evolved into the largest platform for international cooperation playing an ever more important role in promoting development and prosperity around the world. Marked by last year's successful Second Belt and Road Forum for International Cooperation, it has embarked on a new phase of high quality cooperation. Over the past year and more, despite headwinds like COVID-19 and a sluggish global economy, Belt and Road cooperation has pressed ahead against all odds, making new, encouraging progress.

First, our family of partners has continued to expand. Over the past year, 29 new government-to-government cooperation documents were signed, bringing the total number of such documents to 200.

Second, trade and economic exchanges have continued to expand. In 2019, trade in goods between China and BRI partners topped US$1.3 trillion, up by 6 percent year on year. Chinese investment in Belt and Road countries increased by US$15 billion. In the first quarter of this year, trade between China and BRI partners rose by 3.2 percent, and direct investment by China up by 11.7 percent on a yearly basis.

Third, connectivity-building has continued to make headway.

l The China-Pakistan Economic Corridor is moving forward steadily.

l The Chinese and Russian sections of two new bridges, the Heihe highway bridge and Tongjiang railway bridge, have been joined.

l The E763 highway in Serbia and phase I of the Nairobi-Malaba railway entered into operation.

l The construction of the Jakarta-Bandung high speed railway is in full swing.

l A large number of new connectivity projects have been successfully launched.

l Even with the impact of COVID-19, the Man Mai No. 1 Tunnel of the China-Laos railway was holed through.

l The Hungarian section of the Budapest-Belgrade railway has seen important progress.

l Projects from the China-Bangladesh Padma Bridge to the dual-fuel power plant in Cambodia are well underway.

All these have served to bolster the economic growth and social stability of countries concerned.

In the face of COVID-19, BRI partners have extended a helping hand to each other. Many of your countries lent valuable support to China. China, on its part, provided assistance to 122 BRI partners to support their response to the virus. China sent medical teams to 25 countries and shared its experience in containment, diagnostics and therapeutics with all countries without reservation. Between January and May, the China-Europe Railway Express saw a 28 percent increase in freight train services, and 32 percent in freight volume. To date, it has transported 12,524 tons of medical supplies, serving as a key ""cargo lifeline"" and ""bond of solidarity"".

These facts have shown that, far from holding back Belt and Road cooperation, COVID-19 has only highlighted its strong resilience and vitality. Coming through this testing time, BRI cooperation will enjoy a stronger foundation, greater driving forces and brighter prospects.

Colleagues,

COVID-19 is changing the world in profound ways. As President Xi pointed out in his message, humanity is in fact a community with a shared future. Be it in taming the virus or in achieving economic recovery, we cannot succeed without solidarity, cooperation and multilateralism. In this process, we, as BRI partners, have the responsibility and indeed the obligation to set an example.

First, let us step up public health cooperation to make greater contributions to the global fight against COVID-19. As part of the efforts to follow through on the health cooperation commitment set out in the Joint Communiqué of last year's Belt and Road Forum, we need to share experience in COVID-19 response, and make concerted efforts for the assistance and provision of containment supplies and the research and production of therapeutics and vaccines. All this will help push forward the development of a ""Silk Road of health"". We should continue to support WHO in playing a leading role in coordinating the global response to COVID-19, explore the establishment of regional response liaison mechanisms for public health emergencies, and convene when appropriate a high-level meeting on global public health security. We also need to take good care of foreign nationals like our own, and provide timely medical services to and protect the safety of those working for the Belt and Road and other cooperation projects.

Second, let us strengthen connectivity to provide a solid underpinning for the economic recovery of our countries. We need to accelerate the building of a global partnership on connectivity and keep industrial and supply chains secure, open and stable. We need to step up policy coordination and maintain the right balance between proper COVID-19 containment and sound socio-economic development. We need to get key Belt and Road infrastructure projects restarted as early as possible, and work for greater progress in the China-Europe Railway Express, the Maritime Silk Road, the New International Land-Sea Trade Corridor, Silk Road in the Air and other international transportation links. Major Belt and Road projects should be vigorously taken forward such as economic corridors and economic and trade cooperation zones, and investment should be increased in critical infrastructure projects. These efforts will help countries preserve jobs and protect people's well-being, and contribute to the economic stability and growth of Belt and Road partners and the wider world.

Third, let us carry out cooperation in innovation to inject fresh impetus into sustainable global growth. Innovation spurs productivity. We need to harness new industries and business models engendered in the course of COVID-19 response, strengthen cooperation in 5G, big data, artificial intelligence, and cloud computing, and push forward the building of the digital Silk Road. We also need to work with UN development agencies to advance global sustainable development and build a ""green Silk Road"". This way, our economies will not just recover, but realize transformation and upgrading, and our countries will enjoy high-quality development.

Fourth, let us uphold multilateralism, and advocate openness and inclusiveness. The essence of Belt and Road cooperation is the principle of consultation and cooperation for shared benefits and the spirit of openness, inclusiveness and transparency. It also represents the defining trend of our times. Belt and Road cooperation can and should become a prime example of safeguarding globalization and free trade and advancing reform to update global governance. We must firmly reject unilateralism and protectionism, and stay committed to an open world economy. We must defend the multilateral trading system, and enhance trade and investment liberalization and facilitation, in an effort to foster a more open, inclusive and balanced economic globalization that benefits all. We need to advance trilateral and multilateral cooperation to synergize the Belt and Road Initiative and other bilateral and multilateral cooperation programs for win-win results.

Colleagues,

To beat the virus and energize economic recovery is a pressing task facing all our countries. With this in mind, China will strengthen communication and coordination with Belt and Road partners on a priority basis and provide support in the following five key areas.

First, under the US$2 billion international assistance program announced by President Xi Jinping, we will support the affected Belt and Road partners, developing countries in particular, in fighting COVID-19 and resuming economic and social development.

Second, in the development and application of vaccines, we will give positive consideration to the needs of Belt and Road partners, and support technical exchanges and cooperation through such platforms as the Alliance of International Science Organizations in the Belt and Road Region.

Third, we are ready to start technical communication and coordination with Belt and Road partners as soon as possible to discuss the establishment of fast-track lanes for cross-border flows of people and goods.

Fourth, we are ready to hold a transportation ministers' video conference with Belt and Road partners, as part of our efforts to maintain the smooth functioning and security of international industrial and supply chains and logistics systems.

Fifth, we stand ready to step up cooperation with Belt and Road partners in innovation, join hands to promote Silk Road e-commerce, and advance cooperation in smart cities and green development.

Colleagues,

Just as the rainbow comes after the rain, by adhering to the people-centered approach, working together to build a community with a shared future for mankind, and pursuing win-win cooperation, we will make the Belt and Road a model of cooperation, health, recovery and growth. Together, we will bring about a brighter future for the world.

Thank you.

Russia,05-09-2020 00:00,Vladimir Putin,Presidential Regiment review,"Good afternoon, comrades.

Greetings on Victory Day to you, to all Russian military personnel and to our dear veterans.

Seventy-five years ago, in May 1945, the Red Army put an end to the tragedy of the 20th century and triumphantly ended the most violent battle in history.

It was a just, heroic and selfless battle for the entire Soviet nation. It was the Soviet people who defeated Nazism and crushed that monstrous force that brought death, grief and suffering upon millions of people.

I am certain that decades and centuries later, the grateful world will remember this act of heroism, and for the people of Russia, the perseverance, strong will and unity of the generation of victors will always be the highest example of a sacred feeling towards one’s homeland.

Today, a flypast in Russian skies honoured all the heroes of the Great Patriotic War. A ceremonial military march will take place here, in the heart of our country, on Cathedral Square in the Moscow Kremlin.

The heirs of the Great Victory are standing in these ranks today. And I am certain that each and every one of you, all the soldiers and officers of the Russian Armed Forces try to live up to our veterans, to the bravery of front-line fighters, their dedication to military duty and their Oath, their loved ones and their Fatherland, for which they fought never sparing themselves, fought to the last breath at the legendary frontiers and nameless heights.

The Russian Army and Navy are faithful to these martial traditions. Modern-day defenders of our Motherland have proved this in battles against international terrorism, solving extremely difficult tasks of ensuring our country’s security.

We remember the lessons of the war. I would like to stress once again that all the development plans for the Russian Army and Navy will be fulfilled. Nobody should doubt that.

Our Armed Forces have been and will continue to receive the latest military equipment. Most importantly, we know that these weapons are in safe hands. They were entrusted to people who are inspired and guided by love for their Fatherland, their people, dedication to our historical memory and the great legacy of the Victory soldiers.

Glory to our people, the nation of victors!

Glory to the valiant Russian Armed Forces!

Happy Victory Day! Hooray!",President,Vladimir Putin,http://en.kremlin.ru/events/president/transcripts/statements/63330,,NATIONALISM
United Kingdom,11-Jan-16,Theresa May,Mental health problems are everyone’s problem: article by Theresa May,"It is a tragic fact that 1 in 10 children in this country has a diagnosable mental health condition. The long-term effects can be crippling: children with behavioural disorders are 4 times more likely to be dependent on drugs, 6 times more likely to die before the age of 30, and 20 times more likely to end up in prison. While this government legislated for ‘parity of esteem’ in healthcare – so that whatever your illness, physical or mental, you are treated the same – very often the treatment for those with mental illnesses is inadequate. For years it has fallen to civil society, charities, and the media to take on the problem – and I applaud all the work that the Huffington Post has done to raise awareness through its Young Minds Matter series. But it is time for government to do more – to join HuffPost and other campaigners in the fight against something that blights so many young lives. The need is urgent: the number of girls saying they’ve self-harmed has more than trebled in recent years, as just 1 example. That’s why I raised mental health during my speech when I arrived at Downing Street for the first time as Prime Minister. And it’s why today I’m announcing a step-change in the way that we deal with these issues. I want to see mental health addressed not just in our hospitals, but in our classrooms and communities. I want to see the stigma stripped away so that no-one in this country feels unable to talk about what they’re going through or seek help. I want to see a focus on prevention as well as treatment, especially since so many adult mental health problems – which 1 in 4 of us will suffer from at any one time – begin in childhood. This is part of a wider approach to tackle the burning injustices we face in society, and to build a stronger, fairer Britain that works for everyone. For no parent should feel helpless when watching their child suffer. No teacher should feel ill-equipped to deal with a troubled pupil. No teenager should have to leave their local area to seek treatment. No child should ever be left to feel like their life is not worth living. Mental health problems are everyone’s problem. As a society we must face up to that fact. And the announcements I am making today will ensure we do just that.

Weekly Address: Rewarding Hard Work by Strengthening Overtime Pay Protections"," Hi, everybody.  In this year of action, I’m doing everything I can, with or without Congress, to expand opportunity for more Americans.  This week, I ordered a review of our nation’s overtime rules, to give more Americans the chance to earn the overtime pay they’ve worked for. 

Here’s why this matters.  Our businesses have created 8.7 million new jobs over the past four years.  But in many ways, the trends that have battered the middle class for decades have grown even starker.  While those at the top are doing better than ever, average wages have barely budged.  Too many Americans are working harder than ever just to keep up.

We’ve got to build an economy that works for everybody, not just a fortunate few.  We know from our history that our economy grows best from the middle out, when growth is more widely shared.  So we’ve got to restore opportunity for all – the idea that with hard work and responsibility, you can get ahead. 

Now, for more than 75 years, the 40-hour workweek and the overtime protections that come with it have helped countless workers climb the ladder of success.  But today, an overtime exception originally meant for highly-paid employees now applies to workers who earn as little as $23,660 a year.  It doesn’t matter if you do mostly physical labor, or if you work 50, 60, even 70 hours a week.  Your employer may not have to pay you a single extra dime.     

In some cases, this rule makes it possible for workers earning a salary to actually be paid less than the minimum wage.  And it means that business owners who treat their employees fairly can be undercut by competitors who don’t.  That’s not right.  So we’re going to update those overtime rules to restore that basic principle that if you have to work more, you should be able to earn more.  And we’ll do it by consulting workers and businesses, and simplifying the system so it’s easier for everyone. 

Americans have spent too long working more and getting less in return.  So wherever and whenever I can make sure that our economy rewards hard work and responsibility, that’s what I’m going to do.  Because what every American wants is a paycheck that lets them support their families, know a little economic security, and pass down some hope and optimism to their kids.  That’s something worth fighting for.  And I’ll keep fighting for it as long as I’m President. 

Thanks, and have a great weekend.",President,Barack Obama,https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/the-press-office/2014/03/15/weekly-address-rewarding-hard-work-strengthening-overtime-pay-protection,,DEVELOPMENT

Remarks by the President to Military and Civilian Personnel at Joint Base McGuire-Dix-Lakehurst"," Hello, McGuire-Dix-Lakehurst! (Applause.) Thank you, General Martin, for the introduction and for your great leadership of the Air Force Expeditionary Center. I want to thank all the outstanding leaders for coming to welcome me here today, including General Maggie Boor and Colonel James Hodges. I want to thank the folks who are the backbone of our military -- give a big round of applause for your incredible senior NCOs. (Applause.)

This is one of our nation’s premier joint military bases. Everybody is here. We’ve got Army. (Hoo-ah!) We've got Navy. (Oo-rah!) We've got Air Force. (Hoo-ah!) We've got Marines. (Oo-rah!) And we've got some Coast Guard. (Oo-rah!) (Laughter.) Who’s that one Coast Guard -- there you go, that was loud, right there. (Laughter.)

All of you come together as one great American team. And I know that we also have some spouses and families here today. Your wives, your husbands, your partners, your sons, your daughters -- they serve, as well. They make their own sacrifices -- especially when you’re deployed. So our military families are the heroes on the home front. Give it up for our remarkable military families. (Applause.)

We've got some outstanding elected officials who support the mission of this facility each and every day. I want to thank Governor Christie for joining us here today. (Applause.) We've got some outstanding members of Congress who are here -- Bob Menendez, Cory Booker, Congressmen Jon Runyan, Congressman Donald Norcross, and incoming Congressman Tom MacArthur. (Applause.) And they were already lobbying me about the base on the way in, so they’re doing a good job. (Laughter.)

It is great to be back. I was here last year and visited with some of you on my way to the Jersey Shore. Christie and I went down to Asbury Park, spent some time on the boardwalk. We played a little Frog Bog. Chris’s kids taught me how to hit the hammer to get those little frogs into the buckets. It was hard. And then Christie beat me at football toss, which really aggravated me. (Laughter.) And he bragged about it afterwards, which is okay, but I will get a rematch at some point.

But we weren’t there just to have fun. We came because, after Hurricane Sandy, people across this state -- including those of you here at this base -- you had to pick yourselves up, pull together, rebuild, show that here in New Jersey, here in America, we are stronger than any storm. Like a friend of mine from New Jersey likes to say, “Wherever this flag is flown, we take care of our own.” That's what we do here in New Jersey. That's what we do all across America.

And this facility exemplifies that spirit. For nearly a century, our flag has flown right here. Millions of Americans passed through the old Fort Dix. This was where they shipped out. This was where they were welcomed home. One of them was Don Drysdale, Hall of Fame Dodgers pitcher. And he had the same thought as a lot of new recruits at basic training: “What the hell am I doing here?” (Laughter.) Another recruit remembered, “I cleaned a lot of latrines with toothbrushes.”

Among those who were demobilized here was a soldier from Tennessee, serial number 53310761, a guy named Sergeant Elvis Presley. He was all shook up. (Laughter.) His homecoming was a little different, though. Apparently the King drove off in a limo. (Laughter.) Now, if it were up to me, I’d give all you all limos when you come home.

Because part of the message I’m here to deliver on behalf of the American people is very simple: It’s just to say thank you. Thank you for your extraordinary service. I thank you as your President because you inspire me. And of all the privileges I have in serving in this office, nothing comes close to the honor of serving as your Commander-in Chief.

And I also thank you on behalf of more than 300 million Americans. We Americans may disagree and debate and argue sometimes -- that is part of our democracy. It is messy sometimes. Sometimes it results in some gridlock in Washington. But whether liberal or conservative, Democrat or Republican, white, black, brown, rich, poor -- no matter how we pray, no matter who we love, when it comes to our troops, when it comes to you and your families, as Americans we stand united. We are proud of you. We support you. And we can never thank you enough. (Applause.)

And that’s especially true now, during the holidays. We can gather with family and friends because you’re willing to hug yours goodbye and step forward to serve. After a long day, we can come home because you’re willing to leave your home and deploy. We get to celebrate birthdays and anniversaries and holidays, go to soccer games and go to dance recitals because you’re willing to miss those in your family. We’re free and safe and secure over here because you’re willing to serve over there.

That’s the noble spirit of your sacrifice. That’s the selfless character of our military. Those are the precious gifts that you give America -- not just this time of year, but all year, every year. You never stop serving. You never stop giving. You guys are like Santa in fatigues. (Laughter.) Although, I’ll bet one of those C-130s is a little more efficient than Santa’s sleigh. (Applause.) I figured I’d get something out of our guys on that. (Laughter.)

I also wanted to be here, though, because after more than a decade of war, our nation is marking an important milestone. Ever since our country was attacked that awful September morning, 9/11, our nation has been at war in Afghanistan. Many people here have deployed there, or to Iraq, and you’ve deployed multiple times in some cases. There are people here who’ve lost really good friends, patriots who made the ultimate sacrifice, including 54 fallen heroes from this base, who we will honor forever.

For more than a year, Afghan forces have been in the lead to secure their country, and that means more of our troops have been coming home, including right here to this joint base. So let me just say to all of you who’ve returned from Afghanistan in recent weeks, on behalf of a grateful nation, I want to say welcome home. You’re home for the holidays. And we’re glad to have you back.

Now, this month, in just two weeks, the transition that we’re making in Afghanistan will be complete. Afghans will take full responsibility for their security. This month, after more than 13 years, our combat mission in Afghanistan will be over. This month, America’s war in Afghanistan will come to a responsible end.

Now, that doesn't mean everything is great in Afghanistan. Afghanistan is still a very dangerous place. But I want you, and every American who has served in Afghanistan, to be proud of what you’ve accomplished there. Because your generation -- the 9/11 Generation -- has met every mission that's been given to you. You helped decimate the core al Qaeda leadership and deliver justice to Osama bin Laden. He will not be attacking here anymore. You helped to prevent terrorist attacks against this country. You helped push back the Taliban. You helped train Afghan forces to take the lead. You helped make possible a historic election this year and the first democratic transfer of power in Afghanistan’s history. Despite all their challenges, Afghans are now looking to the future. And that's all because of you. That's makes us safer, and it gives them a chance for a better future.

Even as our combat mission ends, our commitment to Afghanistan endures. We’ll continue to have a limited military presence there because we’ve got to keep training and equipping Afghan forces, and we’ve got to conduct counterterrorism missions because there are still remnants of al Qaeda there. After all the sacrifices you've made, we want to preserve the gains that you've made. We want a stable and secure Afghanistan. And we want to make sure that country is never again used to launch attacks against the United States of America.

Now, this year is also a reminder that even as our combat mission ends in Afghanistan, there are still challenges to our security around the globe. In times of crisis, people around the world look to one nation to lead, and that is the United States of America. Even our critics, when they get into trouble they're calling us. And when the world calls on America, we call on you -- our men and women in uniform -- because nobody can do what you do.

One news article said it best: When our forces train here, folks who live nearby might “feel the ground shake” because no other military in the world is as good as you, as ready as you, as capable as you, able to go as far, able to go as fast as you do and perform your basic missions. Nobody. Nobody in history has been able to do what you've done.

Which means we’re leading the global coalition against the brutal terrorist group ISIL in Iraq and Syria. And you are doing your part, supporting the aerial refueling that keeps our aircraft in the skies and the airlift that moves our people and equipment into place. Some folks from this base are there right now doing incredible work. And to them, and to all our troops far from home and their families for the holidays, you are in our thoughts, our prayers, and we can’t wait till you come home, too.

Just look at the difference that you and the rest of our military have made -- rescuing thousands of innocent Iraqi men, women and children that were trapped up on a mountain in danger of slaughter. You saved them. Air dropping food and water and medicine, saving countless lives. America led the way. That’s what we do.

Along with our coalition partners, we are hammering these terrorists, taking out their fighters, their commanders, hundreds of vehicles and tanks, nearly 200 oil and gas facilities, the infrastructure that funds their terror. More than a thousand fighting positions, checkpoints, buildings, barracks -- we’re taking them out. That's because of the work that you do. We’re cutting their command and control and supply lines, and making it harder for them to maneuver.

In Iraq, local forces have held the line in some places and pushed back ISIL in other places. In Syria, our airstrikes are inflicting heavy losses on ISIL fighters and leaders. Because of you, we have blunted their momentum and we have put them on the defensive. And these terrorists are learning the same thing that the leaders of al Qaeda have learned the hard way: They may think that they can chalk up some quick victories, but our reach is long. We do not give up. You threaten America, you will have no safe haven. We will find you. And like petty tyrants and terrorists before you, the world is going to leave you behind and keep moving on without you, because we will get you. That's thanks to you.

Now, this campaign in Iraq will take time. But make no mistake, our coalition isn’t just going to degrade this barbaric terrorist organization, we’re going to destroy it. And because this isn’t just a military effort, we’re going to keep working with those in the Middle East who believe in tolerance and opportunity and peace, because that's what the region needs. These terrorists only know how to destroy. And we know how to do something bigger -- how to build the security and peace and justice that we can build with others. But none of that would be possible without you. That’s American leadership. That's the difference you make.

In the same way that we’re leading the fight against ISIL, we’re leading the global fight against Ebola in West Africa. And you've been doing your part -- deploying to Liberia and Senegal, improving airfields, setting up the logistics and command-and-control, building the infrastructure, manning that air bridge, airlifting food and equipment and personnel. You have been out front.

And if you doubt the impact that you’re having, take a look at what’s going on there. With your help, we’ve built new treatment centers. We're training more health care workers. We're delivering medicine and supplies. Other countries are now willing to come in because you laid the foundation. And this is still a terrible epidemic, and the world has to keep on stepping up, but in Liberia, where we focused our efforts, cases are starting to decline. Ultimately, we will have saved thousands of lives because of you.

As one of our American commanders said, “Everywhere I go, Liberians are waving; hope is what we’re providing.” Or as one West African put it, “We’ve always loved America and for them to come in and help at a time like this reinforces that.” That’s the difference you’re making. There are people who are alive today because of what you guys do. That’s American leadership.

So, stepping back for a moment, we’re at a turning point. When I took office, we had nearly 180,000 troops in Iraq and Afghanistan. By the end of this month, we’ll have fewer than 15,000 in those two countries. We’ve now brought home about 90 percent of our troops -- 90 percent. The time of deploying large ground forces with big military footprints to engage in nation-building overseas, that's coming to an end.

And going forward, our military will be leaner. But as your Commander-in-Chief, I’m going to make sure we keep you ready for the range of missions that we ask of you. We are going to keep you the best-trained, the best-led, the best-equipped military in the history of the world because the world will still be calling.

And that’s why it was so important that folks in Congress -- Democrats and Republicans -- came together and passed legislation that I’m going to sign to keep our government open and funded for the coming year. And that includes military operations -- the support and commissaries that your families depend on, a pay raise for you, health care for our wounded warriors and our veterans. (Applause.) You’ve always been there for us; we’ve got to be there for you.

And let me make one other point. At this time of transition, I know some of you will be returning to civilian life. I was talking about this with the two generals that I rode over with. We want to make sure you can enjoy the American Dream that you helped to defend. So we’ll keep helping you with the transition assistance and the credentialing and the licensing to help find civilian jobs worthy of your incredible talents.

We’re going to keep funding the Post-9/11 GI Bill, and keep working with colleges and universities to help you and your families realize your dream of a higher education. And as many of you know, Michelle -- the First Lady -- Vice President’s wife, Jill Biden; everybody at Joining Forces, we’re all going to be saying to every company in America: If you want somebody who’s going to get the job done, hire a military spouse. Hire a veteran. That’s the difference you can make here at home. Because that’s also American leadership -- the jobs and the opportunity, and the country that we can build together as one American team. (Applause.) You understand that. You’ve trained for it. And when you get in the job, that’s what you deliver every single time.

So I want to leave you with a story of somebody who has a special understanding of the American spirit. I just met them before I came out here, but before I came out, Yeoman Carrie Chavez and Staff Sergeant Ashley Montgomery, they did the Pledge of Allegiance and sang our National Anthem -- and I had a chance to take a picture with them out back. And I asked them where they’re from, and they’re from Jersey, of course. (Laughter.) And, in fact, Ashley said that her dad had served at this facility 30 years earlier. So I asked her, had she ever left the base -- (laughter) -- and she said, yes, she had been deployed at four other bases. But that’s one example of American service -- a generation passing the baton to the next generation; entire families who have served our country nobly, dating back in some cases over a century.

But then there’s another part of the American story. There’s another young man I met. His name is Nelson Rieu -- and Nelson is here today. Wave, Nelson. There’s Nelson. (Applause.) Now, the reason I want to tell Nelson’s story is because, unlike Ashley, Nelson wasn’t born here on base, he wasn’t born in Jersey. He was born in the Republic of Congo. And when his country slipped into civil war, he and his mother became refugees. And that was a terrible civil war -- over a million people died in that civil war. That was a hard life. When he was 20 years old, he and his mom got some incredible news -- “the best thing that’s ever happened to me,” he says. He had the chance to come to America.

So they land in Los Angeles, and Nelson said it was like being in a movie -- all these glistening buildings and freeways. And they settled in Arizona. And Nelson barely spoke a word of English. So he took high school classes -- English, American history; he earned his high school diploma. And then he signed up to serve a country that wasn’t even yet fully his own. He raised his hand, took the oath, joined the United States Air Force. And then, this past Fourth of July, he put on his uniform, he raised his hand again, and he took another oath to become a citizen of the United States. “The Fourth of July,” he says, “is my new American birthday.”

And today, Airman First Class Nelson Rieu is an engineering apprentice here on base, helping to keep his fellow airmen safe. And at 24 years old, he dreams of someday joining the Special Forces. And he says, “Freedom is the reason why I am in this country and [why I] wanted to be part of those who sustain that freedom. It's a great feeling to know you're the backbone of the greatest nation on Earth.”

So you think about that. You’ve got folks whose dads were born on -- or who were born on base and who served going back generations. But then you’ve got new Americans with that same patriotism, that same sense of what we’re about as Americans, that same creed that we can all pledge allegiance to, regardless of what we look like or where we come from. We’re fighting on the same team for the same values and the same ideals.

So thank you for your patriotism, Nelson. (Applause.)

And that’s one of the things that makes America exceptional, and what makes our military the absolute best in the world. It’s not just your training, or your equipment, or your technology -- although all that’s important. What makes us special, what makes us the best is all of you. It’s your character and your willingness to say, “Send me.” Your dedication to duty, and your courage, and your readiness to defend our values and our ideals of freedom and liberty -- not just for us, but for people all around the world.

You are the backbone of the greatest nation on Earth -- and you always will be that. And for that, America is eternally grateful, and I am incredibly proud to serve as your Commander-in-Chief.

So, happy holidays, everybody. (Applause.) God bless you. God bless your families. God bless our Armed Forces. God bless the United States of America. Thank you.

    The situation in Venezuela continues to pose an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States.

USA,14-06-2017 00:00,Donald Trump,Statement by President Trump on the Shooting in Virginia,"THE PRESIDENT:  As you all know, shortly after 7:00 a.m. this morning, a gunman opened fire on members of Congress and their staffs as they were practicing for tomorrow’s annual charity baseball game.

Authorities are continuing to investigate the crime, and the assailant has now died from his injuries.  The FBI is leading the investigation and will continue to provide updates as new information becomes available.

Congressman Steve Scalise, a member of House leadership, was shot and badly wounded, and is now in stable condition at the hospital, along with two very courageous Capitol Police officers.  At least two others were also wounded.

Many lives would have been lost if not for the heroic actions of the two Capitol Police officers who took down the gunman despite sustaining gunshot wounds during a very, very brutal assault.

Melania and I are grateful for their heroism and praying for the swift recovery of all victims.

Congressman Scalise is a friend, and a very good friend.  He’s a patriot and he’s a fighter.  He will recover from this assault.  And, Steve, I want you to know that you have the prayers not only of the entire city behind you, but of an entire nation and, frankly, the entire world.  America is praying for you and America is praying for all of the victims of this terrible shooting.

I spoke with Steve’s wife, Jennifer, and I pledged to her our full and absolute support — anything she needs.  We are with her and with the entire Scalise family.

I have also spoken with Chief Matthew Verderosa — he’s doing a fantastic job — of the Capitol Police to express our sympathies for his wounded officers and to express my admiration for their courage.  Our brave Capitol Police perform a challenging job with incredible skill, and their sacrifice makes democracy possible.

We also commend the brave first responders from Alexandria Police, Fire and Rescue who rushed to the scene.  Everyone on that field is a public servant — our courageous police, our congressional aides who work so tirelessly behind the scenes with enormous devotion, and our dedicated members of Congress who represent our people.

We may have our differences, but we do well, in times like these, to remember that everyone who serves in our nation’s capital is here because, above all, they love our country.

We can all agree that we are blessed to be Americans, that our children deserve to grow up in a nation of safety and peace, and that we are strongest when we are unified and when we work together for the common good.

Please take a moment today to cherish those you love, and always remember those who serve and keep us safe.  God bless them all, God bless you, and God Bless America.

Thank you.",President,Donald Trump,https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefings-statements/statement-president-trump-shooting-virginia/,,OTHERS
USA,18-04-2013,Barack Obama,"
Remarks by the President at Interfaith Service in Boston, MA","Hello, Boston! 

Scripture tells us to “run with endurance the race that is set before us.”  Run with endurance the race that is set before us. 

On Monday morning, the sun rose over Boston.  The sunlight glistened off the Statehouse dome.  In the Common and the Public Garden, spring was in bloom.  On this Patriot’s Day, like so many before, fans jumped onto the T to see the Sox at Fenway.  In Hopkinton, runners laced up their shoes and set out on a 26.2-mile test of dedication and grit and the human spirit.  And across this city, hundreds of thousands of Bostonians lined the streets -- to hand the runners cups of water and to cheer them on.

It was a beautiful day to be in Boston -- a day that explains why a poet once wrote that this town is not just a capital, not just a place.  Boston, he said, “is the perfect state of grace.”  (Applause.)

And then, in an instant, the day’s beauty was shattered.  A celebration became a tragedy.  And so we come together to pray, and mourn, and measure our loss.   But we also come together today to reclaim that state of grace -- to reaffirm that the spirit of this city is undaunted, and the spirit of this country shall remain undimmed.

To Governor Patrick; Mayor Menino; Cardinal O’Malley and all the faith leaders who are here; Governors Romney, Swift, Weld and Dukakis; members of Congress; and most of all, the people of Boston and the families who’ve lost a piece of your heart.  We thank you for your leadership.  We thank you for your courage.  We thank you for your grace. 

I’m here today on behalf of the American people with a simple message:  Every one of us has been touched by this attack on your beloved city.  Every one of us stands with you. 

Because, after all, it’s our beloved city, too.  Boston may be your hometown, but we claim it, too.  It’s one of America’s iconic cities.  It’s one of the world’s great cities.  And one of the reasons the world knows Boston so well is that Boston opens its heart to the world.

Over successive generations, you’ve welcomed again and again new arrivals to our shores -- immigrants who constantly reinvigorated this city and this commonwealth and our nation.  Every fall, you welcome students from all across America and all across the globe, and every spring you graduate them back into the world -- a Boston diaspora that excels in every field of human endeavor.  Year after year, you welcome the greatest talents in the arts and science, research -- you welcome them to your concert halls and your hospitals and your laboratories to exchange ideas and insights that draw this world together. 

And every third Monday in April, you welcome people from all around the world to the Hub for friendship and fellowship and healthy competition -- a gathering of men and women of every race and every religion, every shape and every size; a multitude represented by all those flags that flew over the finish line.

So whether folks come here to Boston for just a day, or they stay here for years, they leave with a piece of this town tucked firmly into their hearts.  So Boston is your hometown, but we claim it a little bit, too.  (Applause.)

I know this because there’s a piece of Boston in me.  You welcomed me as a young law student across the river; welcomed Michelle, too.  (Applause.)  You welcomed me during a convention when I was still a state senator and very few people could pronounce my name right.  (Laughter.)

Like you, Michelle and I have walked these streets.  Like you, we know these neighborhoods.  And like you, in this moment of grief, we join you in saying -- “Boston, you’re my home.”  For millions of us, what happened on Monday is personal.  It’s personal.

Today our prayers are with the Campbell family of Medford.  They're here today.  Their daughter, Krystle, was always smiling. Those who knew her said that with her red hair and her freckles and her ever-eager willingness to speak her mind, she was beautiful, sometimes she could be a little noisy, and everybody loved her for it.  She would have turned 30 next month.  As her mother said through her tears, “This doesn’t make any sense.” 

Our prayers are with the Lu family of China, who sent their daughter, Lingzi, to BU so that she could experience all this city has to offer.  She was a 23-year-old student, far from home. And in the heartache of her family and friends on both sides of a great ocean, we’re reminded of the humanity that we all share.

Our prayers are with the Richard family of Dorchester -- to Denise and their young daughter, Jane, as they fight to recover. And our hearts are broken for 8-year-old Martin -- with his big smile and bright eyes.  His last hours were as perfect as an 8-year-old boy could hope for -- with his family, eating ice cream at a sporting event.  And we’re left with two enduring images of this little boy -- forever smiling for his beloved Bruins, and forever expressing a wish he made on a blue poster board:  “No more hurting people.  Peace.”  

No more hurting people.  Peace.

Our prayers are with the injured -— so many wounded, some gravely.  From their beds, some are surely watching us gather here today.  And if you are, know this:  As you begin this long journey of recovery, your city is with you.  Your commonwealth is with you.  Your country is with you.  We will all be with you as you learn to stand and walk and, yes, run again.  Of that I have no doubt.  You will run again.  (Applause.)  You will run again. (Applause.)

Because that’s what the people of Boston are made of.  Your resolve is the greatest rebuke to whoever committed this heinous act.  If they sought to intimidate us, to terrorize us, to shake us from those values that Deval described, the values that make us who we are, as Americans -- well, it should be pretty clear by now that they picked the wrong city to do it.  (Applause.)  Not here in Boston.  Not here in Boston.  (Applause.)

You’ve shown us, Boston, that in the face of evil, Americans will lift up what’s good.  In the face of cruelty, we will choose compassion.  In the face of those who would visit death upon innocents, we will choose to save and to comfort and to heal.  We’ll choose friendship.  We’ll choose love. 

Scripture teaches us, “God has not given us a spirit of fear and timidity, but of power, love, and self-discipline.”  And that’s the spirit you’ve displayed in recent days. 

When doctors and nurses, police and firefighters and EMTs and Guardsmen run towards explosions to treat the wounded -- that’s discipline. 

When exhausted runners, including our troops and veterans -- who never expected to see such carnage on the streets back home  -- become first responders themselves, tending to the injured -- that’s real power. 

When Bostonians carry victims in their arms, deliver water and blankets, line up to give blood, open their homes to total strangers, give them rides back to reunite with their families -- that’s love.

That’s the message we send to those who carried this out and anyone who would do harm to our people.  Yes, we will find you.  And, yes, you will face justice.  (Applause.)  We will find you. We will hold you accountable.  But more than that; our fidelity to our way of life -- to our free and open society -- will only grow stronger.  For God has not given us a spirit of fear and timidity, but one of power and love and self-discipline.

Like Bill Iffrig, 78 years old -- the runner in the orange tank top who we all saw get knocked down by the blast -- we may be momentarily knocked off our feet, but we’ll pick ourselves up. We’ll keep going.  We will finish the race.  (Applause.)  In the words of Dick Hoyt, who’s pushed his disabled son, Rick, in 31 Boston Marathons -- “We can’t let something like this stop us.”  (Applause.)  This doesn’t stop us.  (Applause.)  

And that’s what you’ve taught us, Boston.  That’s what you’ve reminded us -- to push on.  To persevere.  To not grow weary.  To not get faint.  Even when it hurts.  Even when our heart aches.  We summon the strength that maybe we didn’t even know we had, and we carry on.  We finish the race.  (Applause.)  We finish the race.  (Applause.)  

And we do that because of who we are.  And we do that because we know that somewhere around the bend a stranger has a cup of water.  Around the bend, somebody is there to boost our spirits.  On that toughest mile, just when we think that we’ve hit a wall, someone will be there to cheer us on and pick us up if we fall.  We know that.  (Applause.)  

And that’s what the perpetrators of such senseless violence -- these small, stunted individuals who would destroy instead of build, and think somehow that makes them important -- that’s what they don’t understand.  Our faith in each other, our love for each other, our love for country, our common creed that cuts across whatever superficial differences there may be -- that is our power.  That’s our strength. 

That’s why a bomb can’t beat us.  That’s why we don’t hunker down.  That’s why we don’t cower in fear.  We carry on.  We race. We strive.  We build, and we work, and we love -- and we raise our kids to do the same.  And we come together to celebrate life, and to walk our cities, and to cheer for our teams.  When the Sox and Celtics and Patriots or Bruins are champions again -- to the chagrin of New York and Chicago fans -- (laughter) -- the crowds will gather and watch a parade go down Boylston Street.  (Applause.)  

And this time next year, on the third Monday in April, the world will return to this great American city to run harder than ever, and to cheer even louder, for the 118th Boston Marathon.  (Applause.)  Bet on it.  (Applause.)   

Tomorrow, the sun will rise over Boston.  Tomorrow, the sun will rise over this country that we love.  This special place.  This state of grace.

Scripture tells us to “run with endurance the race that is set before us.”  As we do, may God hold close those who’ve been taken from us too soon.  May He comfort their families.  And may He continue to watch over these United States of America.  (Applause.)",President,Barack Obama,https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/the-press-office/2013/04/18/remarks-president-interfaith-service-boston-ma,,OTHERS
Russia,15-03-2000,Vladimir Putin,Introductory Speech at a Meeting with Heads of District Administrations of the Chechen Republic," Good afternoon,

We have invited you to ask your opinion on the ways to accomplish the main task facing the country and the republic. How can we reinstate socio-economic life in the republic, the republican administration and constitutional institutions of state authority as soon as possible?

It is obvious that we can accomplish nothing unless we implement the most elementary projects and provide the republic with what it had lacked for many years. I understand that it is you who have now assumed the greatest responsibility. The tasks facing you may even appear insurmountable.

Today, I have invited here key Government members, on whom the solution of this problem largely depends. I believe it would be correct to arrange our work as follows. After my introductory speech, I would like to give floor to Deputy Prime Minister Nikolai Koshman, a senior Government official directly responsible for the tasks we examine today. Several Ministers will also speak. Each of you will also be able to speak, to express your views and to make your suggestions. I think it right if we discuss the republic’s problems and ways to solve them in such an informal and candid setting.

I have already mentioned that it is impossible to discuss any ambitious projects unless we settle the most elementary issues. As you may know, the Government has adopted a number of resolutions; and I would like to discuss them with you, to obtain first hand information directly from you as you know what is happening in your districts and what is being done to implement decisions made by the Government. As far as I know, 2 billion roubles have been assigned to restore the republican fuel and energy sector. About 50 million roubles should have been transferred to date. What should be done in this sphere? I would like to learn your opinion on the steps concerning the republican fuel and energy sector and the ways to use republican resources for rebuilding Chechnya.

I want you to know that there can only be one approach here: all Chechen resources available must be channelled to rebuild the republic, its economy and social sector. This is the first point.

The second one. We must restore heating mains and power-supply lines, which are the main priorities. To the best of my knowledge, power supply has already been restored in Shali and Argun. Gazprom and RAO Unified Energy Systems are working actively. I am convinced that you more acutely comprehend different problems, of which senior Government officials and myself are unaware. I also want to hear your opinion on the current situation and on what can be done in the near future.

The initial spring-time sowing campaign is the most pressing problem today. Yesterday, I received Mr Koshman a bit late, at about 11:30 pm; nonetheless, we did some talking. Although documents claim that Mozdok has received part of the 342 million roubles earmarked for the spring-time sowing campaign, Chechnya has not seen the money yet. Of this sum, 192 million roubles are to be spent on equipment purchases. Why is the money still in Mozdok? What is happening to these funds? And how, in your opinion, should they be disbursed?

And, finally, I want to know your opinion of the present-day situation and interaction with security agencies, which are still the only representatives of federal authorities in Chechnya. We will come up with our own proposals. I do not think this is much of a subject for our discussion today, but we will undoubtedly request your advice on building structure of authorities, on local self-governance and other matters. At this meeting, I would like to learn you opinion on your relationships with the military and law enforcement agencies. Please speak your mind on all issues because we must have reliable, objective and authentic information on the situation in Chechnya. This is the only way to adequately react to specific developments and to make proper decisions.

This is all I wanted to say; and now I give floor to Mr Koshman. ",President,Vladimir Putin,http://en.kremlin.ru/events/president/transcripts/statements/22310,,OTHERS

Remarks by the President After Meeting on the Government's Response to Ebola","Well, obviously the news has been dominated by the diagnosis of a second health care worker in Dallas with Ebola. And in light of this second case, I thought it was very important for me to bring together our team, including our CDC Director, Tom Frieden, to hear directly from them in terms of how we are ramping up our efforts here.

Obviously, initially, we want to express concern for the two health workers who have been affected. Our nurses and our health care workers are absolutely vital to the health and wellbeing of our families. They sacrifice for us all the time, not just in this case but in the case of other illnesses that affect us. They are selfless, they work hard, they’re often underpaid. And so our thoughts and prayers are with them, and we have to make sure that we are doing everything we can to take care of them, even as they take care of us.

As a consequence, what we’ve been doing here today is reviewing exactly what we know about what’s happened in Dallas and how we’re going to make sure that something like this is not repeated and that we are monitoring, supervising, overseeing in a much more aggressive way exactly what has taken place in Dallas initially and making sure that the lessons learned are then transmitted to hospitals and clinics all across the country.

First of all, what I’ve directed the CDC to do is that as soon as somebody is diagnosed with Ebola, we want a rapid response team, a SWAT team, essentially, from the CDC to be on the ground as quickly as possible -- hopefully within 24 hours -- so that they are taking the local hospital step by step through exactly what needs to be done and making sure that all the protocols are properly observed; that the use of protective equipment is done effectively; that disposal of that protective equipment is done properly.

The key thing to understand about this disease is that these protocols work. We know that because they’ve been used for decades now in Ebola cases around the world, including the cases that were treated in Emory and in Nebraska. So if they’re done properly, they work. But we have to make sure that, understandably, certain local hospitals that may not have that experience are walked through that process as carefully as possible and we’re going to make sure that this rapid response team can do that.

In addition, we are reviewing every step of what’s happened since Mr. Duncan was initially brought in to the hospital in Dallas so that we understand exactly where some of the problems may have occurred, and doing a thorough canvass and inventory of all the workers who had contact with Mr. Duncan, including those who engaged in some of the testing that took place. We are now communicating all these various lessons to hospitals, clinics, first-responders around the country. And obviously given all the attention that this has received, we’re going to make sure that that provision of information is constant, ongoing, and being updated on a real-time basis.

In addition, we are working very carefully with the Mayor of Dallas, the Governor of Texas and others to make sure that in the event any other cases arise from these health workers, that they are properly cared for in a way that is consistent with public safety.

I know that people are concerned about the fact that the second health care worker had traveled. Here’s what we know about Ebola: That it is not like the flu. It is not airborne. The only way that a person can contract Ebola is by coming into direct contact with the bodily fluids of somebody who is showing symptoms. In other words, if they don’t have symptoms, they’re not contagious.

What we are able to do, however, is to do what’s called contact tracing, so that anybody who may have had contact with someone -- even if it was incidental contact, even if they weren’t showing symptoms -- being able to identify who those individuals are and make sure that they are then being monitored in a way that allows us to make certain that the disease does not spread further. And that’s currently taking place in a very aggressive process conducted by the CDC, HHS, and the rest of our teams.

I want to use myself as an example just so that people have a sense of the science here. I shook hands with, hugged, and kissed not the doctors, but a couple of the nurses at Emory because of the valiant work that they did in treating one of the patients. They followed the protocols, they knew what they were doing, and I felt perfectly safe doing so.

And so this is not a situation in which, like a flu, the risks of a rapid spread of the disease are imminent. If we do these protocols properly, if we follow the steps, if we get the information out, then the likelihood of widespread Ebola outbreaks in this country are very, very low.

But I think what we’ve all learned over the last several weeks is that folks here in this country, and a lot of non-specialized hospitals and clinics, don’t have that much experience dealing with these issues. And so we’re going to have to push out this information as aggressively as possible, and that’s the instructions that I’ve provided to my team.

Just a couple other points. We are going to be monitoring carefully the health status of the other health care workers in Dallas. And obviously they’re concerned. We understand that many of them are scared. And we are going to make sure that we’re on the ground 24/7 to provide them the kind of support, information, and assurances that they need to get through this particular challenge.

And finally, we’re also going to be continually examining screening processes at airports. We’re making sure that in the event that we have additional cases that involve the need for transporting those patients to specialized hospitals, that those teams are in place and those facilities are in place. And we will make sure that on a day-to-day basis we provide the public with all the information they need and any updates about what has happened not just in Dallas but what has been done across the country.

I’ll end with this point: We are going to have to make sure that we do not lose sight of the importance of the international response to what is taking place in West Africa. I am absolutely confident that we can prevent a serious outbreak of the disease here in the United States, but it becomes more difficult to do so if this epidemic of Ebola rages out of control in West Africa. If it does, then it will spread globally in an age of frequent travel and the kind of constant interactions that people have across borders.

And so it is very important for us to understand that the investment we make in helping Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea deal with this problem is an investment in our own public health. This is not simply charity -- although obviously it’s important that America takes the lead in the humanitarian crisis that's taking place there -- but it is also probably the single most important thing that we can do to prevent a more serious Ebola outbreak in this country is making sure that we get what is a raging epidemic right now in West Africa under control.

So for that reason last night I had a call with Prime Minister Abe of Japan to solicit greater support for the international effort. This morning I spoke with Chancellor Merkel of Germany, Prime Minister Renzi of Italy, President Hollande of France, as well as David Cameron, the Prime Minister of Great Britain to make sure that we are coordinating our efforts and that we are putting in a lot more resources than, so far at least, the international community has put into this process.

So bottom line in terms of the public: I want people to understand that the dangers of you contracting Ebola, the dangers of a serious outbreak are extraordinarily low. But we are taking this very seriously at the highest levels of government. And we are going to be able to manage this particular situation, but we have to look towards the future. And if we are not responding internationally in an effective way, and if we do not set up the kind of preparedness and training in our public health infrastructure here in the United States, not just for this outbreak, but for future outbreaks, then we could have problems.

So, in the meantime, I want everybody to be thinking about and praying for the two health workers that have gotten sick. Those who also treated this patient with compassion and care, we just want to say thank you to them. And we are going to be doing everything we can to make sure that they're properly cared for.

Okay, thank you very much.",President,Barack Obama,https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/the-press-office/2014/10/15/remarks-president-after-meeting-governments-response-ebola,,INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS

Weekly Address: Giving Every Student an Opportunity to Learn Through Computer Science For All"," Hi everybody.  As I said in my State of the Union address, we live in a time of extraordinary change – change that’s affecting the way we live and the way we work. New technology replaces any job where work can be automated.  Workers need more skills to get ahead.  These changes aren’t new, and they’re only going to accelerate.  So the question we have to ask ourselves is, “How can we make sure everyone has a fair shot at success in this new economy?”

The answer to that question starts with education. That’s why my Administration has encouraged states to raise standards.  We’ve cut the digital divide in our classrooms in half.  We’ve worked with Congress to pass a bipartisan bill to set the expectation that every student should graduate from high school ready for college and a good job.  And thanks to the hard work of students, teachers, and parents across the country, our high school graduation rate is at an all-time high.

Now we have to make sure all our kids are equipped for the jobs of the future – which means not just being able to work with computers, but developing the analytical and coding skills to power our innovation economy.  Today’s auto mechanics aren’t just sliding under cars to change the oil; they’re working on machines that run on as many as 100 million lines of code.  That’s 100 times more than the Space Shuttle.  Nurses are analyzing data and managing electronic health records.  Machinists are writing computer programs.  And workers of all kinds need to be able to figure out how to break a big problem into smaller pieces and identify the right steps to solve it.

In the new economy, computer science isn’t an optional skill – it’s a basic skill, right along with the three “Rs.”  Nine out of ten parents want it taught at their children’s schools.  Yet right now, only about a quarter of our K through 12 schools offer computer science.  Twenty-two states don’t even allow it to count toward a diploma. 

So I’ve got a plan to help make sure all our kids get an opportunity to learn computer science, especially girls and minorities.  It’s called Computer Science For All.  And it means just what it says – giving every student in America an early start at learning the skills they’ll need to get ahead in the new economy. 

First, I’m asking Congress to provide funding over the next three years so that our elementary, middle, and high schools can provide opportunities to learn computer science for all students. 

Second, starting this year, we’re leveraging existing resources at the National Science Foundation and the Corporation for National and Community Service to train more great teachers for these courses. 

And third, I’ll be pulling together governors, mayors, business leaders, and tech entrepreneurs to join the growing bipartisan movement around this cause.  Americans of all kinds – from the Spanish teacher in Queens who added programming to her classes to the young woman in New Orleans who worked with her Police Chief to learn code and share more data with the community – are getting involved to help young people learn these skills.  And just today, states like Delaware and Hawaii, companies like Google and SalesForce, and organizations like Code.org have made commitments to help more of our kids learn these skills. 

That’s what this is all about – each of us doing our part to make sure all our young people can compete in a high-tech, global economy.  They’re the ones who will make sure America keeps growing, keeps innovating, and keeps leading the world in the years ahead.  And they’re the reason I’ve never been more confident about our future. 

Thanks everybody, and have a great weekend.",President,Barack Obama,https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/the-press-office/2016/01/30/weekly-address-giving-every-student-opportunity-learn-through-computer,,DEVELOPMENT
China,08-01-2015 00:00,Xi Jinping,Jointly Write a New Chapter in the Partnership of Comprehensive Cooperation Between China and Latin America and the Caribbean,"Your Excellency President Luis Guillermo Solis Rivera,
Your Excellency President Rafael Vicente Correa Delgado,
Your Excellency President Nicolas Maduro Moros,
The Right Honorable Prime Minister Perry Gladstone Christie,
Heads of Delegations,
Ladies and Gentlemen,
Dear Friends,

Good morning. On behalf of the government and people of China and also in my own name, I want to warmly welcome our friends who have come all the way from your part of the world to be here.

Today, delegates representing member countries of the Community of Latin American and Caribbean States (CELAC) gather in Beijing for the First Ministerial Meeting of the China-CELAC Forum, a grand gathering in the history of China-Latin America and the Caribbean relations. Your presence has brought warmth to Beijing in the depth of winter.

The convening of the First Ministerial Meeting of the China-CELAC Forum marks the translation of our vision for overall cooperation into reality. The theme of the Meeting ""New Platform, New Starting Point, New Opportunity－Joint Efforts to Promote China-Latin America and the Caribbean Partnership of Comprehensive Cooperation"" well captures the features of the China-CELAC Forum and our shared aspiration for closer overall cooperation.

I am sure this meeting will yield rich results, send to the world a strong message of our commitment to deepening cooperation for common development, and have a major and far-reaching impact on South-South cooperation and the prosperity and progress of the world.

Ladies and Gentlemen,
Dear Friends,

Six months ago, I had a landmark meeting with leaders of Latin American and Caribbean countries in Brasilia. Our two sides decided to establish a partnership of comprehensive cooperation featuring equality, mutual benefit and common development between China and Latin America and the Caribbean and officially launch the China-CELAC Forum. The decision is in keeping with the trend of peace, development and win-win cooperation in our times. It is an innovation in China-Latin America and the Caribbean relations.

Over the last six months, our two sides have followed the guidance of the Joint Statement of the Leaders's Meeting in Brasilia, and worked together to build a new, five-dimensional relationship characterized by sincerity and mutual trust in the political field, win-win cooperation on the economic front, mutual learning and emulation in the cultural sphere, close coordination in international affairs, as well as synergy between China's cooperation with the region as a whole and its bilateral relations with individual regional countries. With the deepening of mutually beneficial cooperation in all areas, the relations between China and Latin America and the Caribbean are flourishing.

－Our mutual political trust has been enhanced. We have maintained high-level exchanges and contacts at other levels and carried out candid and in-depth dialogue on development path, governance, foreign policy and other topics concerning our respective core interests and major concerns. As a result, our mutual understanding is deepening and strategic consensus growing.

－Our practical cooperation has been widened. Within the ""1+3+6"" cooperation framework proposed by China, our two sides have worked hard to develop a cooperation plan for the coming five years and get the three engines of trade, investment and financial cooperation to run at full speed. A group of major cooperation projects in the six areas of energy and resources, infrastructure, agriculture, manufacturing, innovation in science and technology, and information technologies have been decided upon and more are in the pipeline.

－Our people-to-people exchanges have been intensified. There are regular exchanges between our legislatures, political parties and local authorities and robust cooperation in science and technology, education, culture, tourism and other fields, contributing to the deepening friendship between our people and a growing interest in each other.

－Our international coordination has been strengthened. At the United Nations, APEC, G20, G77 and other international organizations and multilateral mechanisms, we have stepped up coordination and cooperation on such major issues as global governance, sustainable development and climate change. The strategic importance and international influence of our cooperation has become all the more evident.

－Our overall cooperation has been advanced. We have completed the preparations for this inaugural Ministerial Meeting in just six months. We have vigorously explored the political design, practical cooperation and institutional building, pooled our wisdom, and built consensus, laying a good foundation for a good start in our overall cooperation.

The rapid, all-round growth of China-Latin America and the Caribbean relations is the result of our enhanced agreement in the perceptions of the global trend, our greater confidence in the prospects of our relations, our clearer consensus on viewing each other as a development opportunity, and our stronger aspiration for a China-Latin America and the Caribbean community of shared destinies. This serves the shared interests of both sides as well as peace and development of Asia, Latin America and the Caribbean and that of the world at large.

Ladies and Gentlemen,
Dear Friends,

We live in a changing world, a world full of new opportunities and new challenges. The world today is witnessing profound adjustments in the international system and international order, and the international balance of power is shifting in a way that is more favorable for peace and development in the world.

A large number of developing countries and emerging market economies are on track of fast development. Through South-South cooperation, they have managed to draw on the development momentum of each other to grow in strength and independent development capacity, which consequently added impetus to the growth of the post-crisis world economy and significantly boosted development of the international order toward greater fairness and justice.

It is time for China and Latin American and Caribbean countries to advance our cooperation and bring it to an even greater depth. When combined, China and Latin American and Caribbean countries cover one fifth of the world's total land mass and are home to one third of the world's population. Together, we account for one eighth of the global economy. This puts us in an advantaged position and gives us valuable resources to bring about all-round and profound growth of our relations.

The China-CELAC Forum, a young seedling in our eyes, needs the dedication and cultivation of both sides for it to grow bigger and stronger. During this Forum meeting, China and CELAC members will have in-depth discussions on overall cooperation and Forum building. Three outcome documents will be adopted, namely, the Beijing Declaration of the First Ministerial Meeting of the China-CELAC Forum, the China-Latin American and Caribbean Countries Cooperation Plan (2015-2019), and the Institutional Arrangements and Operating Rules of China-CELAC Forum.

The Beijing Declaration will highlight the political consensus between the two sides on promoting our partnership of comprehensive cooperation. It will set the general direction for overall cooperation and forum building and lay down the guiding principles for deepening cooperation between the two sides.

The Cooperation Plan will identify priority areas and specify measures to be taken by China and Latin American and Caribbean countries in the coming five years to advance overall cooperation. They will cover the political and security, trade, investment, finance, infrastructure, energy, resources, industry, agriculture, science, technology and cultural fields.

The Institutional Arrangements and Operating Rules of the China-CELAC Forum is designed to promote institutional building, as it will define the forum's coordination and cooperation mechanisms, such as the ministerial meeting, the dialogue of foreign ministers of China and the ""Quartet"" of CELAC and the meeting of national coordinators, so as to provide institutional guarantee for the implementation of political consensus and cooperation plans between the two sides.

I am happy to note that a number of cooperation initiatives I proposed last July at the China-Latin American and Caribbean Countries Leaders' Meeting are being earnestly implemented. Among them, the US$20 billion special loan for infrastructure building projects, the US$10 billion preferential loan and the US$5 billion fund for China-Latin America and the Caribbean cooperation have been or will soon be put into substantive operation. The US$50 million special fund for agricultural cooperation has started to provide funding support for cooperation projects. Besides, the competent departments of China have started to work on the provision of 6,000 government scholarships and 6,000 training opportunities to CELAC members in the coming five years. They have also started work regarding planned invitation of 1,000 leaders of political parties from Latin American and Caribbean countries to visit China as well as the ""Bridge for the Future"" training program that will involve 1,000 young leaders from China and Latin American and Caribbean countries. The proposed ""Science and Technology Partnership"" , the ""Young Scientists Exchange Program"" as well as the planned 2016 Year of Cultural Exchanges put forward by China are all making steady progress. China welcomes CELAC members to take an active part in these programs.

Using today's opportunity, I wish to share with you the following thoughts regarding development of the Forum in the coming years.

First, we need to commit ourselves to the cooperation principle of acting as equal partners. Countries big and small all have their own merits. China and CELAC members, however different in size, strength and level of development, are equal members of the China-CELAC Forum family. We may come together under the vision of friendly consultation, joint development and outcomes sharing, accommodate each other's interests and concerns and build as much consensus as we can so as to lay a solid political foundation for overall cooperation.

Second, we need to adhere to the goal of win-win cooperation. As a governmental cooperation mechanism between China and CELAC members, the forum covers political, economic, trade, people-to-people, cultural, social, science and technology, and many other areas. Our two sides should keep firmly to the goal of pursuing common development, enhance institutional building of the forum, and draw up a blueprint for conducting overall cooperation. This will allow us to produce early harvest and achieve the effect of making one plus one bigger than two, and ensure sustainable development of the forum.

Third, we need to pursue cooperation in flexible and pragmatic ways. It is China's view that China-CELAC overall cooperation and bilateral cooperation between China and CELAC members should be conducted on a parallel basis, which complement and reinforce each other. We may, within the framework of the China-CELAC Forum and relevant forums on specific fields, identify priority areas and projects of cooperation and carry out both bilateral and multilateral cooperation in diversified ways to draw on each other's strengths.

Fourth, we need to ensure open and inclusive cooperation. In conducting the cooperation within the China-CELAC framework, it is important to give full account to different interests and needs of various parties and accommodate each other's comfort level. We welcome active participation in China-CELAC overall cooperation by other regional organizations and multilateral institutions in Latin America and the Caribbean. The forum will therefore contribute to not only solidarity and collaboration between the two sides, but also South-South cooperation and development and prosperity of the world.

Ladies and Gentlemen,
Dear Friends,

Latin America and the Caribbean, which is endowed with abundant resources for development, is one of the most promising emerging regions in the world. In recent years, the region has maintained sound momentum of stability and development. Led by CELAC and other regional organizations, it has achieved fresh progress in strengthening itself through unity and accelerating regional integration. As a result, its overall strength and international influence have been enhanced. Countries in the region have actively pursued multi-direction diplomacy, and they have given priority to fostering friendly and cooperative ties with China and other Asia-Pacific countries, thus creating more space for promoting all-round growth of their relations with China.

The Chinese people are striving to finish the building of a society of initial prosperity in all respects and realize the Chinese dream of great national renewal. The people in Latin America and the Caribbean are endeavoring to achieve their dream of solidarity, collaboration, development and revitalization. So we are bound together by shared dreams and common pursuits.

China is committed to pursuing an independent foreign policy of peace, peaceful development and a win-win strategy of opening-up. China champions and practices a right approach to principles and interests, and it upholds good-faith, friendship and justice. China will integrate its own development with the common development of other developing countries and work with them to build a new type of international relations of win-win cooperation.

Looking ahead, China will maintain medium to high rate of growth, as its economy has entered a new normal. In the next five years, China will import more than US$10 trillion of goods and make over US$500 billion outbound investment, and over 500 million overseas visits will be made by Chinese tourists. All this will offer more market, investment, growth and cooperation opportunities to countries in Latin America, the Caribbean and the rest of the world. In the next ten years, we will work together to raise two-way trade to US$500 billion, and China's direct investment in the region will rise to US$250 billion.

Our two sides have designed an exquisite emblem for the forum. It is in the shape of a pair of peace doves or two clasped hands, which symbolizes close cooperation between the two sides soaring to great heights.

In a word, with the long-term and strategic goal in mind, China will work with Latin American and Caribbean countries to ensure the success of the new platform of China-CELAC overall cooperation. We should take the first Ministerial Meeting as a new starting point and seize new opportunities in China-CELAC overall cooperation. With these efforts, we will write a new chapter in our partnership of comprehensive cooperation and raise our relations to a higher level.

To conclude, I wish the meeting every success.

Thank you.",President,Xi Jinping,https://www.fmprc.gov.cn/mfa_eng/wjdt_665385/zyjh_665391/t1227730.shtml,,INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS
Russia,28-09-2001,Vladimir Putin,Opening Remarks at a Security Council Session,"Esteemed colleagues,

The question of our agenda is the fight against the illicit drug trafficking and the spread of drug addiction. Today this problem is extremely acute, and not only in and by itself. It is directly connected with the success of the fight against crime, or failure if we poorly fight the phenomenon which we will today be talking about, and indeed a whole variety of social and economic issues. And of course most closely intertwined with the number one theme in the world – the struggle against terrorism.

Narco-business is one of the financial sources for terrorist groups and bandit gangs.

It is well known that 80 percent of heroin is supplied to the world market from Afghanistan. And gunmen of certain movements control drug transfer from there to Central Asia and on to Europe through Russia.

Terrorism and drugs are absolutely kindred phenomena. They have common roots and similar destructive power. Terrorism, just as narco-business, has a ramified international network and without doubt bears a trans-national character.

Narco-business also has a pronounced economic aspect. And you and I know: drug addiction as a medical and social phenomenon doesn't exist without a criminal narco-market network, drug sales. And the specialists will confirm today during our discussion what huge profits this business brings in. And this black market does bring in super profits. And the ”dirty“ money is being spent on ”dirty“ aims.

Our country has today become a colossal user of the narco-potion. Today, according to official data alone, there are about 269,000 drug addicts on the register. And the actual figure for drug users is much higher.

Moreover, the narco-market structure is changing. We have a conspicuous growth of the share of highly concentrated drugs, and in the first place Afghan heroin, the proportion of which in total drug use constitutes 28 percent. I think even more.

There grows local drug production in the country, including that of synthetic drugs, cheap and producing instant dependence. What's particularly dangerous is that the number of such laboratories by some expert estimates has greatly increased in Russia in recent years.

Unfortunately, the social base of drug addiction is expanding. Today this disease has percolated to all sections of society, encompassing the territory of the entire country, especially the depressed areas. This is leading to an avalanche-like spread of AIDS. By experts' estimates, 90 percent of the HIV-infected catch the virus precisely through intravenous drug use.

As before, most of the drug addicts — up to 53 percent — are unemployed. It is they who reinforce the army of distributors now as well, which in its turn gives rise to a crime flare.

The saddest thing is that drug addiction has got much younger. The total number of sick persons has increased by nine times over the recent period, and among adolescents by 17 times. The ”average age“ of those who have for the first time tasted drugs barely exceeds 14 years.

In drug trafficking Russia is not only a ”terminal,“ but also a trans-shipment point. Drug syndicates have undertaken a real expansion in Russia. It has become a favorable transit corridor for them.

By experts' estimates, one dollar invested in a narcotic — for example, in Afghanistan — grows into super-profits after the sale of the drug item in European countries. And the overall volume of your and our market — the Russian market — exceeds 1 billion dollars.

Power agencies obviously bear the brunt of the fight against the drug mafia. Here we will inevitably have to strengthen, both financially and with cadres, all of the services that are associated with this kind of activity — the fight against the drug mafia.

By the detention of drug goods alone we cannot solve this problem. Only a small part of merchandise gets confiscated. Experience shows that the detainees are mostly petty retailers, and sometimes also those who need being treated themselves.

In this connection it is time in general to revise the criteria of work in this direction. We must put up a barrier to all the ways for drug penetration into illegal trade, smash the infrastructure of drug networks and eliminate demand.

Dear colleagues,

The reasons for the powerful drug ”invasion“ lie not only in the proximity of the countries of the Golden Crescent. For it there are loopholes in Russia itself — financial, legal, administrative and, of course, social. It is therefore our aim to shut off all the channels for drug distribution — both external and internal.

And one more important aspect of the problem — the attitude to this question of society itself. Drugs are percolating even to social institutions which are responsible for the upbringing of young people. Called upon to serve as an obstacle to drug pushers, the educational institutions, unfortunately, are becoming a bridgehead for drug distribution.

We're encountering the indifference of both the school and parents. Today every fifth recruit brings to the army with him an experience of drug use with all the ensuing consequences for security agencies.

Drug use should not be allowed to become a subculture or fashion. Unfortunately, we're observing signs of this. Even worse, books are being freely sold that propagate a ”narcotic lifestyle.“

All of these manifestations of a grave social disease have to be fought by legal and administrative and educational methods.

Here a considerable workload falls on legislators, legislation in general, and law enforcement practice. Changes ought to be directed toward stiffening criminal responsibility for the most dangerous narco-crimes. Thought should also be given to the introduction of a practice of replacing punishment with coercive treatment for drug addicts. And let us discuss the possibility of providing punishment for drug advocacy.

Obviously the emphasis should be on prevention. We should not limit ourselves to isolated establishments, we must be creating a network of rehabilitation centers. Developing our own methods of treatment and return of people to a normal social life. Unfortunately, drug addiction has ceased to be a ”disease of the rich only,“ and hence we must expand the network of state institutions for the poor. But at the same time we need to develop and create a transparent legal base for the work of private centers.

An important set of tasks is connected with the elimination of financial channels for narco-business, which can be cut off not only by fighting against criminal elements, but also through the use of a whole system of special measures. Including the struggle against the legalization of criminal proceeds.

The border will require intense work. Today the border guards are performing serious tasks and generally working effectively. Over the recent period a particularly great amount of narcotics coming from Afghanistan has been confiscated on the border. Drug pushers and producers are trying to hide away what they have accumulated over many years in huge quantities, commercial quantities, to urgently transfer it abroad, to save it from possible destruction. We must give this our special attention. We also need to consider how to improve the work of the border guards, how to fortify the borders.

The Government Commission for countering drug abuse and trade must, at last, begin to work at full steam. I ask the Chairman of the Government to pay special attention to this problem.

Dear colleagues, the situation with drug addiction in the country is acute. And we must respond to it skillfully and most swiftly. Now I suggest we proceed to discussion.",President,Vladimir Putin,http://en.kremlin.ru/events/president/transcripts/statements/21344,,OTHERS
USA,24-01-2015,Barack Obama,"
Weekly Address: Middle-Class Economics"," Hi, everybody.  This week, in my State of the Union Address, I talked about what we can do to make sure middle-class economics helps more Americans get ahead in the new economy. 

See, after some tough years, and thanks to some tough decisions we made, our economy is creating jobs at the fastest pace since 1999.  Our deficits are shrinking.  Our energy production is booming.  Our troops are coming home.  Thanks to the hard work and resilience of Americans like you, we’ve risen from recession freer to write our own future than any other nation on Earth. 

Now we have to choose what we want that future to look like.  Will we accept an economy where only a few of us do spectacularly well?  Or will we commit ourselves to an economy that generates rising incomes and rising chances for everyone who makes the effort?

I believe the choice is clear.  Today, thanks to a growing economy, the recovery is touching more and more lives.  Wages are finally starting to rise again.  Let’s keep that going – let’s do more to restore the link between hard work and growing opportunity for every American. 

That’s what middle-class economics is – the idea that this country does best when everyone gets their fair shot, everyone does their fair share, and everyone plays by the same set of rules. 

Middle-class economics means helping workers feel more secure in a world of constant change – making it easier to afford childcare, college, paid leave, health care, a home, and retirement. 

Middle-class economics means doing more to help Americans upgrade their skills through opportunities like apprenticeships and two years of free community college, so we can keep earning higher wages down the road. 

Middle-class economics means building the most competitive economy in the world, by building the best infrastructure, opening new markets so we can sell our products around the world, and investing in research – so that businesses keep creating good jobs right here.

And we can afford to do these things by closing loopholes in our tax code that stack the decks for special interests and the superrich, and against responsible companies and the middle class.

This is where we have to go if we’re going to succeed in the new economy.  I know that there are Republicans in Congress who disagree with my approach, and I look forward to hearing their ideas for how we can pay for what the middle class needs to grow.  But what we can’t do is simply pretend that things like child care or college aren’t important, or pretend there’s nothing we can do to help middle class families get ahead. 

Because we’ve got work to do.  As a country, we have made it through some hard times.  But we’ve laid a new foundation.  We’ve got a new future to write.  And I’m eager to get to work. 

Thanks, and have a great weekend. ",President,Barack Obama,https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/the-press-office/2015/01/24/weekly-address-middle-class-economics,,DEVELOPMENT
USA,21-01-2013,Barack Obama,"
Inaugural Address by President Barack Obama","Vice President Biden, Mr. Chief Justice,
members of the United States Congress, distinguished guests, and fellow citizens:  
 
Each time we gather to inaugurate a President we bear witness to the enduring strength of our Constitution.  We affirm the promise of our democracy.  We recall that what binds this nation together is not the colors of our skin or the tenets of our faith or the origins of our names.  What makes us exceptional -- what makes us American -- is our allegiance to an idea articulated in a declaration made more than two centuries ago:
“We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal; that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights; that among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.”  
 
Today we continue a never-ending journey to bridge the meaning of those words with the realities of our time.  For history tells us that while these truths may be self-evident, they’ve never been self-executing; that while freedom is a gift from God, it must be secured by His people here on Earth.  (Applause.)  The patriots of 1776 did not fight to replace the tyranny of a king with the privileges of a few or the rule of a mob.  They gave to us a republic, a government of, and by, and for the people, entrusting each generation to keep safe our founding creed.  
 
And for more than two hundred years, we have.  
 
Through blood drawn by lash and blood drawn by sword, we learned that no union founded on the principles of liberty and equality could survive half-slave and half-free.  We made ourselves anew, and vowed to move forward together.  
 
Together, we determined that a modern economy requires railroads and highways to speed travel and commerce, schools and colleges to train our workers. 
 
Together, we discovered that a free market only thrives when there are rules to ensure competition and fair play.  
 
Together, we resolved that a great nation must care for the vulnerable, and protect its people from life’s worst hazards and misfortune. 
 
Through it all, we have never relinquished our skepticism of central authority, nor have we succumbed to the fiction that all society’s ills can be cured through government alone.  Our celebration of initiative and enterprise, our insistence on hard work and personal responsibility, these are constants in our character.
 
But we have always understood that when times change, so must we; that fidelity to our founding principles requires new responses to new challenges; that preserving our individual freedoms ultimately requires collective action.  For the American people can no more meet the demands of today’s world by acting alone than American soldiers could have met the forces of fascism or communism with muskets and militias.  No single person can train all the math and science teachers we’ll need to equip our children for the future, or build the roads and networks and research labs that will bring new jobs and businesses to our shores.  Now, more than ever, we must do these things together, as one nation and one people.  (Applause.) 
 
This generation of Americans has been tested by crises that steeled our resolve and proved our resilience.  A decade of war is now ending.  (Applause.)  An economic recovery has begun.  (Applause.)  America’s possibilities are limitless, for we possess all the qualities that this world without boundaries demands:  youth and drive; diversity and openness; an endless capacity for risk and a gift for reinvention.  My fellow Americans, we are made for this moment, and we will seize it -- so long as we seize it together.  (Applause.)  
 
For we, the people, understand that our country cannot succeed when a shrinking few do very well and a growing many barely make it.  (Applause.)  We believe that America’s prosperity must rest upon the broad shoulders of a rising middle class.  We know that America thrives when every person can find independence and pride in their work; when the wages of honest labor liberate families from the brink of hardship.  We are true to our creed when a little girl born into the bleakest poverty knows that she has the same chance to succeed as anybody else, because she is an American; she is free, and she is equal, not just in the eyes of God but also in our own.  (Applause.)   
 
We understand that outworn programs are inadequate to the needs of our time.  So we must harness new ideas and technology to remake our government, revamp our tax code, reform our schools, and empower our citizens with the skills they need to work harder, learn more, reach higher.  But while the means will change, our purpose endures:  a nation that rewards the effort and determination of every single American.  That is what this moment requires.  That is what will give real meaning to our creed.   
 
We, the people, still believe that every citizen deserves a basic measure of security and dignity.  We must make the hard choices to reduce the cost of health care and the size of our deficit.  But we reject the belief that America must choose between caring for the generation that built this country and investing in the generation that will build its future.  (Applause.)  For we remember the lessons of our past, when twilight years were spent in poverty and parents of a child with a disability had nowhere to turn. 
 
We do not believe that in this country freedom is reserved for the lucky, or happiness for the few.  We recognize that no matter how responsibly we live our lives, any one of us at any time may face a job loss, or a sudden illness, or a home swept away in a terrible storm.  The commitments we make to each other through Medicare and Medicaid and Social Security, these things do not sap our initiative, they strengthen us.  (Applause.)  They do not make us a nation of takers; they free us to take the risks that make this country great.  (Applause.)  
 
We, the people, still believe that our obligations as Americans are not just to ourselves, but to all posterity.  We will respond to the threat of climate change, knowing that the failure to do so would betray our children and future generations.  (Applause.)  Some may still deny the overwhelming judgment of science, but none can avoid the devastating impact of raging fires and crippling drought and more powerful storms.  
 
The path towards sustainable energy sources will be long and sometimes difficult.  But America cannot resist this transition, we must lead it.  We cannot cede to other nations the technology that will power new jobs and new industries, we must claim its promise.  That’s how we will maintain our economic vitality and our national treasure -- our forests and waterways, our crop lands and snow-capped peaks.  That is how we will preserve our planet, commanded to our care by God.  That’s what will lend meaning to the creed our fathers once declared.
 
We, the people, still believe that enduring security and lasting peace do not require perpetual war.  (Applause.)  Our brave men and women in uniform, tempered by the flames of battle, are unmatched in skill and courage.  (Applause.)  Our citizens, seared by the memory of those we have lost, know too well the price that is paid for liberty.  The knowledge of their sacrifice will keep us forever vigilant against those who would do us harm. But we are also heirs to those who won the peace and not just the war; who turned sworn enemies into the surest of friends -- and we must carry those lessons into this time as well.
 
We will defend our people and uphold our values through strength of arms and rule of law.  We will show the courage to try and resolve our differences with other nations peacefully –- not because we are naïve about the dangers we face, but because engagement can more durably lift suspicion and fear.  (Applause.)
 
America will remain the anchor of strong alliances in every corner of the globe.  And we will renew those institutions that extend our capacity to manage crisis abroad, for no one has a greater stake in a peaceful world than its most powerful nation.  We will support democracy from Asia to Africa, from the Americas to the Middle East, because our interests and our conscience compel us to act on behalf of those who long for freedom.  And we must be a source of hope to the poor, the sick, the marginalized, the victims of prejudice –- not out of mere charity, but because peace in our time requires the constant advance of those principles that our common creed describes:  tolerance and opportunity, human dignity and justice.  
 
We, the people, declare today that the most evident of truths –- that all of us are created equal –- is the star that guides us still; just as it guided our forebears through Seneca Falls, and Selma, and Stonewall; just as it guided all those men and women, sung and unsung, who left footprints along this great Mall, to hear a preacher say that we cannot walk alone; to hear a King proclaim that our individual freedom is inextricably bound to the freedom of every soul on Earth.  (Applause.) 
 
It is now our generation’s task to carry on what those pioneers began.  For our journey is not complete until our wives, our mothers and daughters can earn a living equal to their efforts.  (Applause.)  Our journey is not complete until our gay brothers and sisters are treated like anyone else under the law  –- (applause) -- for if we are truly created equal, then surely the love we commit to one another must be equal as well.  (Applause.)  Our journey is not complete until no citizen is forced to wait for hours to exercise the right to vote.  (Applause.)  Our journey is not complete until we find a better way to welcome the striving, hopeful immigrants who still see America as a land of opportunity -- (applause) -- until bright young students and engineers are enlisted in our workforce rather than expelled from our country.  (Applause.)   Our journey is not complete until all our children, from the streets of Detroit to the hills of Appalachia, to the quiet lanes of Newtown, know that they are cared for and cherished and always safe from harm.  
 
That is our generation’s task -- to make these words, these rights, these values of life and liberty and the pursuit of happiness real for every American.  Being true to our founding documents does not require us to agree on every contour of life. It does not mean we all define liberty in exactly the same way or follow the same precise path to happiness.  Progress does not compel us to settle centuries-long debates about the role of government for all time, but it does require us to act in our time.  (Applause.)  
 
For now decisions are upon us and we cannot afford delay.  We cannot mistake absolutism for principle, or substitute spectacle for politics, or treat name-calling as reasoned debate.  (Applause.)  We must act, knowing that our work will be imperfect.  We must act, knowing that today’s victories will be only partial and that it will be up to those who stand here in four years and 40 years and 400 years hence to advance the timeless spirit once conferred to us in a spare Philadelphia hall. 
 
My fellow Americans, the oath I have sworn before you today, like the one recited by others who serve in this Capitol, was an oath to God and country, not party or faction.  And we must faithfully execute that pledge during the duration of our service.  But the words I spoke today are not so different from the oath that is taken each time a soldier signs up for duty or an immigrant realizes her dream.  My oath is not so different from the pledge we all make to the flag that waves above and that fills our hearts with pride.  
 
They are the words of citizens and they represent our greatest hope.  You and I, as citizens, have the power to set this country’s course.  You and I, as citizens, have the obligation to shape the debates of our time -- not only with the votes we cast, but with the voices we lift in defense of our most ancient values and enduring ideals.  (Applause.)  
 
Let us, each of us, now embrace with solemn duty and awesome joy what is our lasting birthright.  With common effort and common purpose, with passion and dedication, let us answer the call of history and carry into an uncertain future that precious light of freedom.  
 
Thank you.  God bless you, and may He forever bless these United States of America.  (Applause.)  ",President,Barack Obama,https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/the-press-office/2013/01/21/inaugural-address-president-barack-obama,,OTHERS
United Kingdom,03-Feb-11,David Cameron,Prime Minister's speech at the UK-India CEO Forum,"Well, thank you very much, and welcome, everyone, to Number 10 Downing Street. A particular welcome to Peter and Ratan, who are going to take this CEO Forum ahead. I think this is fantastically important. I’ve always believed that the India-Britain relationship is strong but could be much, much stronger. I think it was one of the first major visits I made as Leader of the Opposition, one of the first major visits I made as Prime Minister, taking a huge number of ministers and businesses and cultural institutions and, I think, getting the relationship off to a good start. Let me stress once again although the ties of history and language and culture and the past are important, actually, I think this is an extremely modern, dynamic, forward-looking relationship of two countries with very complementary interests and complementary economies and I think you see that all over. Obviously, for Britain, we want to link ourselves up to the fastest growing parts of the world and India is clearly one of them, but the complementarily between our economies - take our universities, where we have a fantastic university sector and India has some extraordinarily great institutions that we want to partner with. The issue of green growth, where there are enormous needs in India and great expertise, we also believe we have expertise and also a great ability to raise capital. It’s not actually the old cliche of some of our relationships where people think there’s a new manufacturing economy in the East and an old banking and services economy in the West. Actually, it’s much more complementary and smarter than that. Actually, Indian investment is re-enlivening some of our manufacturing industries here in the UK and British investment in India is adding to your fantastic service sector, so it’s a much more complex situation. Obviously, Britain is one of the most open economies in the world, one of the easiest places to come and invest, to come and do business, to come and own a business, to come and raise capital and we want to make it even more open, even more welcoming. I think one of the things we can discuss today is the great opening up of the Indian economy, but how can we take that further into new sectors and to new business areas and how can Prime Minister Singh and I help, with you, to advance this agenda. I had three things I was hoping we could touch on in the session I’m with you today. The first is that - how do we open up the UK economy and make it even more favourable to Indian inward investment? There have been years when Indian investment into Britain has been higher than that of Japan, so the relationship is very good, but how do we take it even further? The second question is this issue of how we further open the Indian economy. I think it’s obviously had a fantastic growth record. There’s big inward investment in terms of infrastructure, in terms of manufacturing - I remember visiting the JCB plant - but what about services, what about banking, what about retail, how do we take that forward? The third issue I wanted to touch on is very time-critical, which is in terms of encouraging not just bilateral trade, but in terms of encouraging what I think is both in India’s interest and Britain’s interest; we want an advance in terms of the world trade system. While many people assume that the Doha Trade Round is somehow a dead parrot and politicians get together and talk about it but it’s not actually going to happen, I believe there is actually a last chance this year, 2011. At the G20, President Obama and I and others agreed we needed to make the deal a bit bigger to make it have more benefits to more people and I think there are signs that the Chinese and the Americans are now negotiating genuinely to try and make that happen and if that happens I think Obama would take a deal to Congress and I think that Britain and India, as two countries that I think would benefit from the completion of the Doha round. I hope that the message can be sent from the business community to the politicians ‘get on and make this deal’. I think that’s vitally important in the US, where we need to build an alliance for more trade, more openness, but I’m sure it’s also true in India as well, where a message from business to the Indian government about the desirability of a bigger, bolder Doha Trade Round - 80% of it is already done, it’s just the last bits. But I think that the agenda we’re all passionate about is expanding trade, investment, making sure our economies are growing and we’re getting good jobs for all our people, cannot but be helped by an increase in world trade. So those are the three issues I’m keen that we try and address today, but really this is for me to listen to what the CEOs are saying about what needs to change in Britain to make us more attractive and what needs to change in India to increase the flows of investment both ways and that’s what I hope we’ll use the time for and then Prime Minister Singh and I can discuss and take forward these agendas.

Russia,26-04-2006,Vladimir Putin,Opening Remarks at a Meeting on Social and Economic Development in the Siberian Federal District,"Good afternoon, dear colleagues,

Not only do we have a busy international agenda for our meetings here in Tomsk but also a busy domestic agenda. One of the items on our domestic agenda is the current social and economic situation in the Siberian Federal District.

As you know, the Development Strategy for Siberia was adopted in 2002. We must admit, however, that it has not brought about the substantial growth in the region that we had hoped for.

Despite its natural competitive advantages, the Siberian Federal District remains dependent on federal assistance. Federal assistance accounts for an average share of 19 percent in the Siberian Federal District regional budgets’ general expenditure, and in some regions in the district it accounts for more than 50 percent.

Gross regional product has been growing on average in Russia, but the per capita gross regional product in the Siberian Federal District has decreased for the second year in a row.

Development is very uneven from region to region within the district itself with basic socio-economic development indicators varying very widely.

The demographic issue remains high on the agenda. This is a problem for our country in general but it is particularly acute in Siberia. It is clear what is causing people to leave the region. Socio-economic factors are behind this outflow of population. Real incomes in the district come to 85 percent of the national average, but the cost of living here is higher than on average in Russia. Dozens of ministerial and regional programmes are being implemented in the district, but they often simply lead to funds being dispersed and achieve only fragmented and insignificant results. This is another general problem. We need to learn to concentrate our resources on the key development issues.

It is clear that we need to find solutions that will cardinally change the situation – innovative solutions. The development of Siberia and our country’s other eastern regions must be based on their effective integration into the Russian economy and world markets.

What we need to do is analyse very carefully the promising plans for developing sectors and regions and get rid of duplication of effort and insufficient focus on the key issues. In this respect I would like to mention the following priorities.

First, we need to make more effective use of the district’s natural resources. These resources constitute a real competitive advantage and are the key to resolving the region’s energy problems.

Until now, the region’s export sectors have developed based on cheap and accessible raw materials. But the lack of infrastructure to access new deposits means that this advantage is gradually being lost. Investment, both foreign and Russian, is starting to move to other countries and other regions. I ask you to look at this issue in more detail today.

Second, we need to make more active use of the innovative environment – and quite developed it is – that already exists in the district, and get scientific centres involved.

Many new ideas, as you know, are not developed in practice because of lack of resources. But it is precisely your task, the task of the local, regional and federal authorities, to make these areas attractive for investment. I hope that we will discuss this point in detail today.

Third, industrially developed regions of the district must work to achieve a noticeable increase in the number of processing facilities. Today they account for only 20 percent of our industry.

I remind you that at the beginning of April at the meeting in Syktyvkar we talked in detail about primary timber processing. This subject is also relevant in Siberia, which has more than 40 percent of Russia’s wood resources. But this is just one example. In reality there are many more areas for development work.

Finally, one other important issue – that of improving the transport infrastructure in Siberia. It has been noted in the past that this region is crossed by international trans-continental transport corridors. This enables Siberia to act not just as one of the links in the transport chain connecting European Russia to the Far East, but also gives it the real possibility of playing a much greater part as a bridge linking Europe – via Russia – to the Asia-Pacific Region. We must not forget that the Asia-Pacific Region is probably the fastest-growing region in the world and this creates huge opportunities for Russia to open up new markets and make use of its national advantages.

We also need to develop more actively communications along the Trans-Siberian route, increase the amount of passenger and freight traffic and not by rail but also by air and by water.

We need to modernise roads effectively and on time. Finally, we need to re-establish active use of the Northern Sea Route. We must not forget that this will do a lot to make the population more mobile, will open up new horizons for business activity in the district and ultimately help raise living standards for the people who live here.

In conclusion, I would like to note particular significance of cross-border and inter-regional cooperation in the Siberian Federal District. This is a powerful growth resource for all of Siberia. I ask you to speed up work on modernising the border infrastructure and on improving the legal foundation for inter-regional cooperation.

These are the points I wanted to make. Now let us begin work.

Russia,09-11-2008 00:00,Dmitry Medvedev,Opening Address at a Meeting on Establishing an International Financial Centre in Russia,"Good afternoon!

Our agenda for today contains a discussion about the prospects for further developing the country's economy and basic approaches to establishing an international financial centre in Russia. This topic is not a new one. We started talking about it long ago. And despite the fact that this is not the easiest period for international financial markets, this task will not be removed from our agenda; on the contrary, it has become even more urgent.

Its involvement in global capital flows is already having very serious consequences on the Russian financial market. And obviously, the effects of the financial crisis that began last summer and is still ongoing, have affected our market, as they have most other national markets. Moreover, higher inflation, problems with cash flow and liquidity have led us to question the leadership of traditional financial centres and their ability to resolve the situation. I talked about this at the forum in St Petersburg and elsewhere as well.

You know that despite this, over the past six years our economy has remained stable, maintained macroeconomic stability, and demonstrates a high rate of GDP growth. Last year this growth amounted to more than eight per cent, this year we expect about eight per cent as well. That's all very good. During this time the Russian stock market and the country’s sovereign rating grew, the banking system became stronger, and most sectors of the economy received new investments. Among Russia’s competitive advantages, we must, of course, include its convenient geographical position and the consistent diversification of its economic structures, as well as its close, multifaceted relationships with most leading countries, both developed countries and those with economies in transition.

All these factors have made and continue to make Russia naturally attractive both for CIS states and other states, and, naturally, this allows us to conclude that an international financial centre located in our country could potentially become a major international financial platform in region. One that in the future could compete successfully in global financial markets. In addition, something that for us is no less important and, in the current situation, perhaps even more important: such a centre will modernise the entire financial infrastructure of our country and become a means for attracting additional resources to the country and the economy. And not only foreign resources but also Russian ones.

Establishing a large and modern centre in Russia, capable of generating more balanced, innovation-based economic growth, is something we have repeatedly talked about. It will create the appropriate conditions for the transformation of domestic savings into investments. Market infrastructure and market instruments will thus improve their performance. Creating a new centre should also act as a real contribution to deepening our economic integration with CIS countries and other states.

But there are obvious problems. We should remember that an open capital market, as we are all now acutely aware, brings with it a lot of risks and the likelihood of an unbalanced inflow or outflow of funds can cause problems with banking liquidity and inflationary risk which, in turn, could overheat the economy.

Soon the government cabinet should adopt a strategy for the development of the financial market. It is obvious that this strategy should oversee a qualitative improvement to the domestic financial system. I believe that these measures should be approved as soon as possible and they should contribute to enhancing the attractiveness of the Russian financial market.

In general, the situation in Russia remains quite normal. We understand that we continue to have a budgetary surplus and the economy demonstrates, as I just said, very good growth rates. And I talked about this yesterday when we discussed the situation in the stock market. But the cabinet and the Central Bank must do everything necessary for attracting additional flows into our financial markets. This is quite clear today and it absolutely needs to be done.

I am sure that the situation that exists in the stock market is a temporary phenomenon that obviously does not reflect the objective state of the economy. The Russian stock market remains very attractive for investments, and serious investors understand this. For that reason we need to improve our management of the market. Now I will set out a few main aspects of our work to establish an international financial centre.

First. Already by 2008–2009 we need to adopt a full package of laws, other documents, regulations, which will be aimed at modernising the infrastructure of our financial markets and enhancing the instruments that are used there, including legislation on exchanges, on clearing services, and on a central depository. Securities of foreign issuers should also have direct access to the stock market. A wide range of traded assets must make the centre truly beneficial for both Russian and foreign participants. And conducting operations through advanced technology should become more reliable and cheaper.

Once again I stress that the centre should provide easy access to transactions. This implies minimal registration and approval procedures for both issuers and investors, as well as for financial institutions.

Another special aspect, a fundamental one, is the special tax regime in financial markets. It must be also competitive and, therefore, attractive to foreign participants.

The second area of activity relates to ensuring the transparency of markets while protecting them from insider leaks and the manipulation of prices. The development of markets requires the improvement of corporate governance — this is a constant challenge — and the better protection of property rights in Russia. And, of course, we must continue to work to improve the overall financial literacy of our people, build up a positive general attitude to financial institutions and to existing procedures.

The third task consists in the development of the business environment. This includes creating a convenient transport and information infrastructure, simplifying visa rules and customs regimes and — in certain situations — rules relating to property rights. These are the guarantees which all investors require and, of course, Russia is no exception to this rule.

Another problem that is obvious to all, especially in situations where difficulties occur, relates to staffing. Training remains a very serious challenge both for our economy as a whole and for the financial market in particular.

In conclusion, I would like to point out that the scale of this challenge requires coordinated work. Only this can allow Russia to create a full-value financial centre in the next few years. I have no doubt that this will come about. And we will do everything so that the Moscow financial centre assumes its rightful place among the major international financial centres.

That is all I wanted to say at the beginning. Let us move on to our discussion.",President,Dmitry Medvedev,http://en.kremlin.ru/events/president/transcripts/statements/1360,,DEVELOPMENT
USA,05-11-2013,Barack Obama,"
Remarks by the President Before Meeting with Business Leaders on Comprehensive Immigration Reform","In addition to talking about the Red Sox -- (laughter) -- we are here to talk about immigration reform.  We’ve got an outstanding group of leaders here, a wide cross-section of industry; we’ve got manufacturers, service sector, food, high-tech.  And they represent just a small cross-section of the businesses all across the country who are deeply committed to making sure that we get comprehensive immigration reform done, and done quickly.

Just last week, we had 600 business and faith leaders who came to emphasize that this is something that is not only the right thing to do, but it’s also critical to our economy.  We know that the Senate bipartisan bill that already passed would grow the economy by $1.4 trillion above and beyond the growth that’s already taking place.  We know it will reduce our deficit by $850 billion.  This is not -- these aren’t my estimates.  These are independent estimates that had been made about the salutary effect that comprehensive immigration reform will have on our economy.  And these businesses understand that. 

They understand that if we are serious about border security, if we do a better job of streamlining the legal immigration system, if we are holding employers who aren’t doing the right thing accountable, and we provide a pathway to citizenship for those who have paid a fine, learned English, are getting to the back of the line, taking their responsibilities  -- that all together, these businesses are going to have more customers, we’re going to see people who are currently working here, out of the shadows, paying taxes and getting right with the law.  We have the opportunity when young people come to this country to study on our dime, making sure that if they’re able and willing, they can stay here, start businesses of their own, contribute to our economy, help our exports.

So this is something that has strong bipartisan support.  Keep in mind that my predecessor, George W. Bush, was a strong supporter of this.  We have a fascinating cross-section of people -- some unlikely bedfellows, some very liberal folks, some very conservative folks -- who all believe that now is the time to get this done.  And as we saw in the Senate, there is the strong potential for bipartisan support.

So what I’m going to be talking to the business community about is how we can continue to amplify this issue in the coming weeks.  There’s no reason why we can’t get this done before the end of the year.  And I continue to be hopeful that with the leadership of many who are around this table who represent hundreds of thousands of employees and billions of dollars of assets, who are important in their communities all across the country, them joining up with law enforcement, clergy, citizens, to make the case that ultimately folks up on Capitol Hill will do the right thing.

And although right now there’s been some resistance from House Republicans, what’s been encouraging is, is that there are a number of House Republicans who have said, we think this is the right thing to do, as well.  And it’s my estimation that we actually have votes to get comprehensive immigration reform done in the House right now. 

The politics are challenging for the Speaker and others, and we want to make it as easy for him as possible.  This is not an issue where we’re looking for a political win.  This is one where we’re looking for a substantive win for the U.S. economy and the American people and the businesses that are represented here.

I’m very grateful to all of you who have joined us.  But we’re going to be pushing to make sure that we send out that clarion call up towards Capitol Hill, see if we can get this done before the end of the year.

Thank you very much, everybody.",President,Barack Obama,https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/the-press-office/2013/11/05/remarks-president-meeting-business-leaders-comprehensive-immigration-ref,,DEVELOPMENT
Russia,12-06-2002 00:00,Vladimir Putin,Speech and Excerpts from Discussion at the Russian Rectors Congress,"Good afternoon, dear friends.

First of all I thank you for the suggestion to attend your Congress and work together with you. The problems of education are topical for our entire country, all of society. It is obvious that not only the present, but also the future of Russia depends on a successful solution of these questions. And so today, in this audience I will allow myself to express some thoughts concerning not only sectoral aspects of education, but also encompassing some other questions closely adjoining what you are engaged in.

I would like to say at once that the high level of Russian education is one of the few factors that enables us to rank among the leading states of the world.

Of course, this asset, this level has not emerged by itself and has appeared, of course, not today and not even yesterday. That became possible only because from the very first days — way back from the times of formation of Moscow University, where we are today, educational policy was a matter of state importance. It was purposefully dealt with at the highest state level.

At the initial period, the European experience and foreign instructors were, of course, widely used. But after long years — its own system grew and materialized in Russia, its own models of education. As we see, they have stood the test of time, have proved to be of a pretty decent quality. And for all the need to modernize our education, no one disputes this fact today either within the country or abroad.

I would also like to recall that Russia is currently at a complex period of transformation. We have achieved many successes in democratic construction and in the formation of a civilized market. However, we all understand that a great deal has yet to be done. And it is the task of national education to help go through this transitional period quickly, competently, efficiently.

In this connection Russian citizens should get the knowledge they will need not only today, but also in the future. And it is a question of not only applied disciplines, but also fundamental knowledge in the domain of the social sciences, of international and public life.

I am speaking of this because Russian universities historically were not only a center for obtaining knowledge. They traditionally influenced the political, economic and cultural life of the country. Here in various periods of our history the issues of politics were widely discussed, debates took place in respect of the place of our country in the processes of world development. I think that these topics agitate no less today's professors and students of the Russian institutions of higher learning.

One still-popular debate is on the advantages of the geopolitical position of Russia. Another — on the importance of its rich natural resources in the competition for world markets. Thus, they often say of Russia that it still remains a raw material and energy export country. Of course, to a significant extent this is so, but it would be strange not to use the wealth which our country has a priori. Some countries with a favorable climate and good lands are traditionally agricultural countries, even with well- developed science and modern industry, for example, France. And never mind — they are proud that it is an agricultural country. Here there is nothing to be ashamed of.

We have already won serious positions in energy markets. And, let's say straight away, they should not be given up, we do not intend to do so.

Yet today's task is not only to use natural resources to our advantage, but also not to fall behind major world economic trends in the process.

By the way, developing the domestic fuel and energy sector is important not only in terms of international economic cooperation. This is very important for us ourselves. Russia is a northern country, and a huge part of our economy works, in the direct sense, ”for heating.“ In the direct, not in the figurative sense of the word. This is our reality. It is not bad and not good. But this objective factor we, just as other northern countries of the world, have to take into consideration. Specifically — in connection with the need for qualitative training of specialists for the energy industries.

It is also clear that even the most efficient utilization of natural resources will not bring Russia leading positions in the world economy. In our days high technologies account for an ever greater share in world markets. Including — in so important industries for Russia as transportation and energy.

We still use our own huge potentials of science and education poorly and we don't know how to enlist them to get a worthy spot on the information and communication maps of the world, in international economic markets.

I consider that the present disunity of science and education largely hinders that policy and I am confident that you will talk about this today. About this often and much has been talked recently. Just as the rigid division of science — into academic, university, corporate and sectoral. It is in the interest of Russia to stimulate the natural process of integration of the various levels and organizational forms of education and science into a single market of knowledge.

What is today being done in this direction is thus far too little, insufficient and I non-systemic. The uniform final state examination, essentially directed to bring general and higher education closer, will not solve all the problems in this sphere either. Without an interrelated set of measures to solve this task, we will not get the required effect.

* * *

Modern education is aimed at obtaining systemic knowledge. Including — at understanding in what place of our history we are, what is our place in the contemporary world and what values of civilization should be chosen.

Thus, we rightfully consider ourselves Europeans and always remember that the culture of Russia and its traditions in their essence were formed precisely by European civilization. In this connection our policy is primarily directed to cooperation with the European countries and to the formation of a common European economic space.

But we are, of course, in Asia too. And here our national interests demand that we maintain normal, friendly relations with the countries of Central Asia and with China, India and Japan. It should not be forgotten that the most rapidly developing part of the world is precisely the countries in the Asia-Pacific region.

In this connection it is important for Russia to pursue a policy which will assure that it has stable positions in all the areas important for it. But there are objective obstacles on this road. One of the most serious is new threats to international stability.

Yes, thanks to the efforts of the world community world wars are a thing of the past. But they have been replaced, unfortunately, by other wars. And at issue are not regional and local conflicts. At issue are terrorism and extremism.

It is known that war is a ”continuation of politics,“ only by different means. International terrorists, whatever they may use as a cover, always wage a struggle for political and economic levers of influence in the world. This is their aim. They are not driven by ephemeral but rather by quite concrete aims. Today's terrorists carefully locate targets for themselves and then strike them with precision. They strike objects and models of civilized economic and social development.

Their objective is to sow fear and bring discord not only to individual cities and countries, but also in relations among states. In the final analysis — in the system of existing international legal relations, at the base of which lie the common democratic values of states and peoples.

Furthermore, particularly dangerous is terrorism the aim of which is the usurpation of state power. In this connection a major task of both national governments and international structures is to prevent the coalescence of the terrorist machine with ruling regimes and not to allow the penetration of the ideology of terror and violence into state policy.

Dear colleagues. In conclusion I would like to dwell briefly on the questions of the training of specialists for individual areas of state life.

Despite the enormous number of students, our state organizations and enterprises experience a colossal shortage of professionals. In addition, private Russian companies are still forced to import qualified personnel from abroad. This means that there is demand for such specialists in the country. There is a market. And, of course, this market is yours. I believe that today it is in common interests to help domestic companies not only with the training of contemporary managers, but also of engineers, technicians, workers of the highest skill.

Needless to say, cadres must continue to be trained for the civil service as well. We are extremely short of well-trained people able to work according to world standards in the domain of state and public services.

I consider it important to modernize also our military education system. I see many military men in the hall and they will understand what I am speaking about. It should be noted that not only Russia today faces this task in relation to new threats. But here too we have many positive things amassed. To forget the positive experience in the sphere of military education is likewise absolutely incorrect.

* * *

And, lastly, a few words on the often criticized conservatism of Russia's education system. A blessing for our country is not the conservation of outdated models, but the preservation of the best traditions and standards of the classical Russian school of education. In this sense we have something to be proud of.

But under today's conditions there can be no question of dogmatism and obtuse conservatism. In the present-day world the rapidity of changes increases from generation to generation. And increases qualitatively, in geometric progression.

Now one can no longer give the child education once and for all life. And it is not even enough to learn all one's life. People have to be taught to learn. And you know that that's precisely how they do in advanced universities. And then, if such is the case, our students and pupils will be able not simply to adapt to changes in the country and the world, but will also themselves shape these changes for the good of the country.

I believe only in this way shall we able to ensure the priority development of education as the most intellectually capacious ”branch“ of the Russian economy.

Thank you for your attention.

I must say that I liked the report very much — it is very substantial and concrete on very many ; it provokes discussion, sometimes a wish to agree, sometimes to dispute. I would like, if I may, to make but a few remarks.

First, I also think that all those who consider education a part of their lives have taken notice of the suggestion which has been made in the academic and political writings regarding the development of education. The rector of Moscow University has precisely mentioned the suggestion of Professor Yasin concerning the reconstruction of education. One can agree with some part of it and disagree with other points. I think that in the final analysis — it's up to the professionals. Based on your proposals and your experience it is necessary, after all, to make a decision.

I think that it is incorrect to raise the question of the aim of transformation as the reduction of the budget load. This is not an aim in itself. There is no such aim. At any rate — there shouldn't be (applause).

But this is not to say that there are no problems here. I draw your attention to the fact that in Moscow — Yuri Mikhailovich [Luzhkov] will confirm — 50 percent of the graduates of medical institutes do not go work as medical doctors, and 60 percent of the agricultural institutes' graduates do not go either. Of course, many will say: it's tough to work there, low salaries, and so on. All this is correct, but they actually do not go to work there. We must bear this in mind. In other areas too there are lots of questions and problems of this kind. This is not a simple problem, but it is there. Of course, it is not only a problem of personnel training, but that also has something to do with this.

Our speaker now spoke of the readiness of our colleges and universities to engage in the training of foreigners and, above all, focus attention on the training of specialists for the CIS. An absolute priority for Russia both in the civilian sphere and in the sphere of military education. The only question is how to solve it. At budget expense or on a commercial basis?

It was said that in some developed countries foreigners are being trained at budget expense, especially in the sphere of military education. But a considerable sector of education there is private. From this sector taxes are collected and then are so distributed as is thought necessary, proceeding from political priorities. This is, of course, very important.

Fundamental science must be profitable for the state. We here this more and more now. Of course, that's nonsense. My own opinion, the opinion of the leadership of the Government does not coincide with this statement. Fundamental science cannot be profitable for the state, it altogether cannot be profitable. If we want to speak of the future of the country, we must put money into this, just as we do into art (applause).

I consider it correct that we must think how to improve the tax legislation as applied to the sphere of education (applause).

As for expenditures, the Treasury, of course, must be watchful, but also liberalizing is a must (applause).

I absolutely agree that colleges and universities must have the legal status of scientific institutions. I am not sure that right now the Ministry of Finance will be ready to at once allocate the required funds, just as concerns the Academy of Sciences, or take something away from the Academy of Sciences. This would be also incorrect. But the lack of this status does not give the right to take part in tenders, to obtain a license for something, to sell an intellectual product, and so on. This is simply absurd.

When we spoke of the system of modernizing education — still, I want to bring it to your notice: the number of students being admitted to the Russian colleges and universities on free-of-charge terms is not down. On the contrary, it is up by 3–4 percent. This is a fact, and we have no right to forget about this. That paid education grows is in it itself not a bad thing. The only bad thing is that the quality is bad. With this I absolutely agree. The state must pay attention to this. They begin competing with major higher educational institutions. But their competition absolutely does not correspond to the reality. It is simply a fraud against the population and the state. Issuing but scraps of paper (applause).

* * *

When they say that some or other problem is closely linked to state security issues, that is mostly to underline the importance of the problem. I must say that all the problems in the sphere of education do not need this additional dramatization. Education by itself is a system-forming thing. If there is advanced and effective education, then there will be an effective state. If not, then there will be no effective state (applause).

* * *

Now with regard to teachers. You know, this is the right way to put the question. Your salary increase was, of course, small, but with what difficulty this is being implemented, both at the center and in the regions, is also well known. I, frankly speaking, had known that there would be failures, and all the same I made this decision in order to activate the work of the Government on this problem. For three or four months, even up to six months there were failures in some regions with the implementation of the salary increase. Now, it seems, for the most part it is all in the condition in which it should be. Of course, we shall give further thought to this matter.

Finally, the last remark. I cannot but express support. You know that fundamental science is separate, but it should not be forgotten, and the state must understand its responsibility, that it is, of course, necessary to enlist the material resources of business for the training of specialists for business and for the economy, to enlist the resource of citizens themselves. By all means so, otherwise you all know what this may lead to.

Viktor Antonovich Sadovnichy has already spoken to the effect that we will train personnel at state expense and export them to the West free of charge. This is a dangerous path. And absolutely incorrect. It is clear that this is a multifaceted problem, and we must create conditions for the work of people here at home. Overnight, we will not be able to do that all the same. This depends on the level of the economy. There will be no great leaps. Gradual evolution is a must. It may be slow, it may be fast. One would like it to be faster, but all the same this will not occur overnight. If business will use its own resources, will spend on human resources, then it will use them. The same holds for citizens. If citizens have gotten an education on their own — then it is their choice where to work. The state must understand where it spends its money and what will come of it in the future. It is without any final decisions that I am saying this. I am saying it so that some thinking should be done on that score.

In Canada, for example, there is a whole program for the attraction of specialists. They do not even try to conceal that. In their embassies there sit special foreign ministry officials who are concerned with the attraction of specialists. I may be mistaken, but, to my mind, the quota is this: 10 percent of the population must be attracted to Canada in a year. And the Canadian Prime Minister says to me: the foreign ministry is a poor worker, it does not provide the 10 percent quota. They attract and select the best specialists at that. Half jokingly, they tell me laughing: you train specialists and we will take them.

* * *

Concerning financing for equipment. A very important problem. I know that this problem is known to everyone here. Young people leave not because the pay is small, but because they see no point in their working here, there is nothing to work with and at. Next year financing for the purchase of equipment for colleges and universities will be increased by 68 percent. The increase for renewing and completing libraries will constitute 240 percent. I understand that 240 percent may be up from zero, but it sounds beautiful, I cannot help citing such a figure.

* * *

Now regarding some other problems which were touched on in passing. For capital construction the budget-allocated funds will be doubled, to three billion rubles. Salary additions for an academic degree will be trippled. Not much, but still it’s something.

Thank you very much for your invitation.",President,Vladimir Putin,http://en.kremlin.ru/events/president/transcripts/statements/21803,,DEVELOPMENT
USA,18-04-2017 00:00,Donald Trump,"Remarks by President Trump on Buy American, Hire American Executive Order","THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you very much.  (Applause.)  These are great, great people and these are real workers.  I love the workers.  We’re doing a good job for the workers.  And I’m thrilled to be back in Wisconsin.  The optimism in this room is the same incredible spirit that is sweeping across our country — and even greater than that great day in November when I won the state of Wisconsin and when we won the presidency.  That was a great day.  (Applause.)  That was a great day.  And thank you, Wisconsin.

No administration has accomplished more in the first 90 days — that includes on military, on the border, on trade, on regulation, on law enforcement — we love our law enforcement — and on government reform.

Today, we’re building on that optimism, and I’m proud to announce that we’re about to take bold, new steps to follow through on my pledge to Buy American and Hire American.

(Applause.)

I can’t think of a better place to make this announcement than right here at Snap-On — I just took a tour of the company — good place, by the way; it’s doing well, too — standing among the workers who make the tools that will rebuild our nation.  Your craftsmanship is incredible.
It’s a pleasure to be see my good friend, Governor Scott Walker.  He has been such a big help.  He has been so incredible. (Applause.)  Stand up, Scott.  Governor Walker.  As well as Senator Ron Johnson.  We worked hard together.  Thank you, Ron.  (Applause.)

And although he could not be here today, my thanks go to Speaker Ryan, who’s represented this city for nearly two decades in Congress.  And you know where he is?  He’s with NATO — so he has a good excuse.  And I said, Ron, make sure these countries start paying their bills a little bit more.  They’re way, way behind, Ron.  We have to — or I’m going to talk to you about that, Ron.
But Paul, you’re over with NATO — get them to pay their bills.  And, Ron, you have to work on that, too.  And, Scott, you’re right here in Wisconsin — you don’t have to bother.  We’ll keep you right here.  (Laughter.)  For a little while at least.

Also with us is a famous local resident, the pride of Kenosha — Reince Priebus, my Chief of Staff.  Where is Reince?  (Applause.)  Where is he?  What a good man.  There he is.  In fact, we flew over his house on the way up and he got all excited, he was taking pictures of it.  (Laughter.)  Reince went to high school right here, just about a mile away, where he took his wife Sally to the prom.  And that was a match made in heaven.  Very nice.

I also want to thank Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin for being with us today.  Secretary Mnuchin is working to put together a tax reform plan to make our industry more competitive and also to provide a level playing field for our workers.  We don’t have a level playing field, believe me.  You’re going to have one very soon.  And our tax reform and tax plan is coming along very well.  It’s going to be out very soon.  We’re working on healthcare and we’re going to get that done, too.

Our Education Secretary, Betsy DeVos, is also here.  Where is Betsy?  She’s around here someplace.  Stand up.  Thank you, Betsy.  (Applause.)  Secretary DeVos is working to ensure that our workers are trained for the skilled technical jobs that will, in the future, power our country.
I’m excited to be joined today by students from Gateway Technical College — (applause) — and remember the college president, Bryan Albrecht.  Thank you.  (Applause.)  Great job.  Thank you very much.  Thank you.  Thank you, Bryan.  Your partnership with Snap-On is a great example of why vocational education is the way of the future.

When I was growing up in Queens, we had vocational schools that were great.  We don’t have schools like that so much anymore, but we’re bringing them back — vocational schools.  These are very talented people that love that type of work, and it’s great work.  It really is great work.  So vocational schools are going to be a big factor in the Trump administration.

Together, we’re going to do everything in our power to make sure that more products are stamped with those wonderful words:  “Made in the USA.”  (Applause.)  In the old days, we used to use it.  We don’t use it so much anymore.  We’re going to start using it again — Made in the USA.

For too long, we’ve watched as our factories have been closed and our jobs have been sent to other faraway lands.  We’ve lost 70,000 factories since China joined the World Trade Organization.  And you’ve seen that and you’ve heard about it — 70,000.  The World Trade Organization — another one of our disasters.  But this election, the American people voted to end the theft of American prosperity.  They voted to bring back their jobs — and to bring back their dreams into our country.

That’s why I’m here today.  In just a few moments, I will be signing a Buy American and Hire American executive order.  You haven’t heard about that in a long time in this country.  With this action, we are sending a powerful signal to the world:  We’re going to defend our workers, protect our jobs, and finally put America first.  (Applause.)  I see all the “Make America Great Again” hats, so it’s a good crowd.  Those are good hats.

Through the years, Snap-On tools have been at the center of our industrial life.  Your tools have fixed the cars our families depend on.  They’ve sailed with the fleets that patrol the oceans.  They’ve fixed the planes that cross our skies.  And Snap-On tools have reached the heights of space, used by astronauts in orbit to carry out their very, very important work.  And I don’t know if you noticed, recently I signed a very big order:  We’re going to spend again on the NASA space program, and that’s something we need, and we also need it psychologically.  (Applause.)  But it’s going to be very exciting.

For decades, this company has served the needs of American workers.  It’s time we had a federal government that does the same.  The “Buy and Hire American” order I’m about to sign will help protect workers and students like those of you in the audience today.  This historic action declares that the policy of our government is to aggressively promote and use American-made goods and to ensure that American labor is hired to do the job.  It’s America first, you better believe it.  (Applause.)  It’s time.  It’s time, right?  It’s time.

First, we will fully monitor, uphold and enforce our Buy American laws — which we haven’t done.  Buy American laws require that when the federal government buys, builds or funds a project, domestic goods and products should be used.  But over the years, these Buy American standards have been gutted by excessive waivers and reckless exemptions.  The result has been countless jobs and countless contracts that have been lost to cheap, subsidized, and low-quality foreign goods.

With this order, I am directing every single agency in our government to strictly uphold our Buy American laws, to minimize the use of waivers, and to maximize Made in America content in all federal projects.  (Applause.)  It’s time.  And for the first time ever, we are going to crack down on foreign bidders that used dumped steel and other subsidized goods to take contracts from workers like you.  They take them away, and they’ve been doing it for a long time.  Not going to happy anymore.  (Applause.)

We are finally standing up for our workers and for our companies.  In short, this order declares that American projects should be made with American goods.  No longer are we going to allow foreign countries to cheat our producers and our workers out of federal contracts.  Everyone in my administration will be expected to enforce every last Buy American provision on behalf of the American worker, and we are going to investigate every single trade deal that undermines these provisions.

Secondly, we are going to enforce the Hire American rules that are designed to protect jobs and wages of workers in the United States.  We believe jobs must be offered to American workers first.  Does that make sense?  (Applause.)  Right now, widespread abuse in our immigration system is allowing American workers of all backgrounds to be replaced by workers brought in from other countries to fill the same job for sometimes less pay.  This will stop.  American workers have long called for reforms to end these visa abuses.  And today, their calls are being answered for the first time.  That includes taking the first steps to set in motion a long-overdue reform of H1B visas.

Right now, H1B visas are awarded in a totally random lottery — and that’s wrong.  Instead, they should be given to the most-skilled and highest-paid applicants, and they should never, ever be used to replace Americans.  No one can compete with American workers when they’re given a fair and level playing field, which has not happened for decades.

We’re using every tool at our disposal to restore the American Dream.  In fact, when it comes to wasteful, destructive, job-killing regulations, we are going to use a tool you all know very well — it’s called the sledgehammer.  (Laughter.)  It’s what we’re going to use.  We’re also going to stand up for our dairy farmers in Wisconsin — (applause) — and I’ve been reading about it, and I’ve been talking about it for a long time — and that demands, really, immediately fair trade with all of our trading partners, and that includes Canada.  (Applause.)  Because in Canada, some very unfair things have happened to our dairy farmers and others, and we’re going to strategy working on that with Ron and with Scott and with Paul, with all of your representatives.  What’s happened to you is very, very unfair.  It’s another typical one-sided deal against the United States.  And it’s not going to be happening for long.

So, Scott, you and Ron and myself and Paul and everybody else, we’re going to get together and we’re going to call Canada, and we’re going to say, “What happened?”  And they might give us an answer, but we’re going to get the solution, not just the answer, okay?  Because we know what the solution is, all right?  (Applause.)  And if you guys can’t do it, we’ll bring maybe Reince.  Reince, you ready, Reince?  We better bring Reince back.  No, we’ll get that done.  We’re going to work on that very hard.  We’re going to work on it immediately; in fact, starting today.  It’s a terrible thing that happened to the farmers of Wisconsin.

The fact is, NAFTA has been a disaster for the United States — a complete and total disaster.  And we’re going to do some things, and we have all sorts of rules and regulations that are horrendous.  Like we want to start to negotiate with Mexico immediately, and we have these provisions where you have to wait long periods of time, you have to notify Congress, and after you notify Congress, you have to get certified, and then you can’t speak to them for 100 days.  The whole thing is ridiculous.

NAFTA has been very, very bad for our country.  It’s been very, very bad for our companies and for our workers, and we’re going to make some very big changes or we are going to get rid of NAFTA for once and for all.  Cannot continue like this, believe me.  (Applause.)

Big things will be happening on trade with other countries over the coming months, and I mean very big.  We’re also working with Congress on tax reform and simplification, and we’re on time if we get that healthcare approval.  So press every one of your congressmen, press everybody, because we want to get that approval.  And it just makes the tax reform easier and it makes it better.  But it’s going to make it steeper, it’s going to be bigger, and that’s what we want to do.
So we’re in very good shape on tax reform.  We have the concept of the plan.  We’re going to be announcing it very soon.  But healthcare — we have to get the healthcare taken care of.  And as soon as healthcare takes care of — we are going to march very quickly.  You’re going to watch — we’re going to surprise you.  Right, Steve Mnuchin?  Right?  Secretary of Treasury.  (Applause.)  I see Sean.  Stand up, Sean.  Stand up.

I had no idea — I was told a year ago — he’s been so great to me — I was told a year ago he’s like a world champion climber; climbs the trees.  And after that I look — every time I look at him, I look at him now differently.  I’m very impressed with that, Sean.  And he’s also very good on television and very helpful.  Thank you.  Thank you, man.  Thank you.

We’ll be making big investments in rebuilding our military and repairing our badly depleted infrastructure.  And that will happen soon also — infrastructure.  Big infrastructure bill, probably use it with something else that’s a little bit harder to get approved in order to get that approved.  But infrastructure is coming, and it’s coming fast.

New ships, bridges, tunnels and airplanes will be constructed with American hands, American steel, and, yes, American tools.  (Applause.)  As we work to restore the American Dream at home, we’re also working to restore America’s standing abroad.  That means strengthening our partnerships and ensuring that our friends and allies pay their fair share, and that very much includes, as I’ve already said in my little statement to Paul, it also includes the NATO companies and countries.  They are really sort of letting us down in that one respect, and we don’t want people taking advantage of the United States.  And that’s not going to happen for very much longer.  I’m going over there very soon and we’re going to have it, and everybody is going to be paying.  And we’re going to be a much happier country, we’re going to be a much happier world.
No matter the circumstances, everyone will know we act from this core conviction that America’s strength must be unmatched and its first priority unquestioned — the safety and security of our citizens.  This is the surest path to a more peaceful and prosperous world for us all.

Together, we can build a better future in the spirit of this company’s earliest days.  Great company, great history.  I recently learned that decades ago, in the 1920s, when your salesman entered a dusty repair shop, or stained, a nice, beautiful stained garage floor — which I’ve seen many of — they would find a spot to lay out a beautiful green felt mat.  The people of the company know what that means.  And on that green felt mat, he would carefully place a gleaming set of new Snap-On tools.

The founders of this company wanted their customers to know that the tools of the mechanic were just as important as the tools of the doctor, the dentist, the politician, or the business leader, and that his craft was a noble, noble craft, as noble as any.  This is a wonderful story about your company and its Wisconsin heritage.  And Wisconsin has a truly great heritage, and it’s led by incredible people.

But it’s also a story that tells us a lot about the American spirit.  In America, we honor work.  We honor grit.  We honor craftsmanship.  We honor the men and women who turn dreams into reality with their own two hands.  In America, we honor all of you.

We are a nation of builders.  We are the country that dug out the Panama Canal, that put a man on the face of the moon, and that linked our cities with majestic railroads and curving highways.  We are the country that is always on the cusp of the next invention.  But we can only get there with all of you.  We can only restore this nation we love so much by working and building with all of you.

We can only get there together.  We are the one people sharing one destiny, saluting one great, beautiful American flag.  I’m thrilled to be here today to celebrate our great American heritage and to proudly embrace our great American future.

I want to thank the people of Wisconsin for doing so much for me.  That’s why I came back here — not just for the company, frankly, for the people of Wisconsin.  You have been so incredible to me and my administration, and we will never, ever let you down.

God bless you.  God bless the American worker.  God bless the American Dream.  And God bless the United States of America.  Thank you all very much.  Tremendous honor.  Thank you.",President,Donald Trump,https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefings-statements/remarks-president-trump-buy-american-hire-american-executive-order/,,DEVELOPMENT
USA,05-08-2021 00:00,Joe Biden,Statement by President Joe Biden  on the Passing of AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka,"I recently called Rich Trumka. It wasn’t scheduled. I just called to check in as old friends do. We started our conversation like always. He asked about Jill and the family and I asked about Barbara and theirs. And then we got to work.

For Rich, work was synonymous with a word that defined his life: dignity. In the more than thirty years of our friendship, he was a fierce and forceful champion for the dignity of the American worker.

Whenever you heard him speak, you understood why. He was the American worker.

A son of a Pennsylvania coal miner, he grew up to be one. He became president of the United Mine Workers at just 33, and nearly thirty years later, he was elected president of the AFL-CIO. Yet no matter how far his career took him, he never forgot where he came from and the people he started with.

For Rich, it was always about doing right by working people – fighting for and protecting their wages, their safety, their pensions, and their ability to build a good, decent, honorable middle-class life. It was about workers improving their own lives and building worker power together. And it was about America itself. It was about the American worker being the heart of our economic might and dynamism.  I’ve always believed that the middle class built this country and unions built the middle class. There is no doubt that Rich Trumka helped build unions all across America.

Perhaps the most important trait I valued in Rich is that he was never afraid to speak truth to power, even if the power was held by people he helped elect – myself included. He was always honest and fair. He was always tough and trustworthy. He was as great a friend and powerful and reliable ally as anyone could have in their corner.

I will miss him as will the countless workers whose lives he made better and the labor movement he led with daring vision. But I know our pain is nothing compared to what Barbara and their son Rich Jr. and their grandchildren Richard and Taylor are feeling on this day. As I told you on the phone after we heard the news, Jill and I send you our love – today and always.

Rich Trumka was a dear friend, a great American, and a good man.",President,Joe Biden,https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/08/05/statement-by-president-joe-biden-on-the-passing-of-afl-cio-president-richard-trumka/,,OTHERS
USA,04-04-2015,Barack Obama,"
Weekly Address: Reaching a Comprehensive and Long-Term Deal on Iran’s Nuclear Program"," This week, together with our allies and partners, we reached an historic understanding with Iran, which, if fully implemented, will prevent it from obtaining a nuclear weapon and make our country, our allies, and our world safer.

This framework is the result of tough, principled diplomacy. It’s a good deal -- a deal that meets our core objectives, including strict limitations on Iran’s program and cutting off every pathway that Iran could take to develop a nuclear weapon.

This deal denies Iran the plutonium necessary to build a bomb. It shuts down Iran’s path to a bomb using enriched uranium. Iran has agreed that it will not stockpile the materials needed to build a weapon. Moreover, international inspectors will have unprecedented access to Iran’s nuclear program because Iran will face more inspections than any other country in the world. If Iran cheats, the world will know it. If we see something suspicious, we will inspect it. So this deal is not based on trust, it’s based on unprecedented verification.

And this is a long-term deal, with strict limits on Iran’s program for more than a decade and unprecedented transparency measures that will last for 20 years or more. And as a member of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, Iran will never be permitted to develop a nuclear weapon.

In return for Iran’s actions, the international community, including the United States, has agreed to provide Iran with phased relief from certain sanctions. If Iran violates the deal, sanctions can be snapped back into place. Meanwhile, other American sanctions on Iran for its support of terrorism, its human rights abuses, its ballistic missile program, all will continue to be enforced.

As I said this week, many key details will need to be finalized over the next three months, and nothing is agreed to until everything is agreed. And if there is backsliding, there will be no deal.

Here in the United States, I expect a robust debate. We’ll keep Congress and the American people fully briefed on the substance of the deal. As we engage in this debate, let’s remember—we really only have three options for dealing with Iran’s nuclear program: bombing Iran’s nuclear facilities—which will only set its program back a few years—while starting another war in the Middle East; abandoning negotiations and hoping for the best with sanctions—even though that’s always led to Iran making more progress in its nuclear program; or a robust and verifiable deal like this one that peacefully prevents Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon.

As President and Commander in Chief, I firmly believe that the diplomatic option—a comprehensive, long-term deal like this—is by far the best option. For the United States. For our allies. And for the world.

Our work -- this deal -- is not yet done. Diplomacy is painstaking work. Success is not guaranteed. But today we have an historic opportunity to prevent the spread of nuclear weapons in Iran, and to do so peacefully, with the international community firmly behind us. And this will be our work in the days and months ahead in keeping with the best traditions of American leadership.",President,Barack Obama,https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/the-press-office/2015/04/04/weekly-address-reaching-comprehensive-and-long-term-deal-iran-s-nuclear-,,INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS
Russia,24-01-2011,Dmitry Medvedev,Emergency meeting following explosion at Domodedovo Airport,"As you know, there has been an explosion at Domodedovo Airport. According to the preliminary information, this is an act of terrorism. Some people have been killed and a number have been injured. I have just spoken with the Healthcare Minister and the Emergencies Minister and instructed them to do everything to arrange immediate medical assistance to the blast victims. Right now, many ambulances are headed for Domodedovo Airport.

I would like to express my sincere condolences to relatives of the victims.

Regarding the law enforcement, first of all, an emergency regime must be effected at all airports, air terminals, and all major transportation hubs and I am hereby instructing Transport Minister Mr Levitin, the Minister of the Interior and the Federal Security Service to join efforts to install procedures which in line with the laws on transport safety would ensure performance of every respective step.

Regarding the investigation, Mr Bastrykin [Chairman of Russia’s Investigative Committee], you must appoint a team of investigators to immediately travel to the site for performing all respective activities. As I directed, at the moment the Mayor of Moscow and the Governor of Moscow Region are already on their way [to Domodedovo Airport]. Every possible investigative action should be conducted in order to quickly collect evidence and possibly accomplish the investigation while the trail is still hot.

In terms of ensuring safety at this airport and at other transportation hubs, [Prosecutor General] Mr Chaika, this currently requires your utmost attention, because following certain events, we passed a whole set of relevant regulations and laws. It should be reviewed how they have been and are followed, because the terrorist attack demonstrates that not all the laws which should be in proper effect, are adequately applied throughout the country. This is to be audited.

Assistance and support to those who have suffered is our top priority at the moment while the rest is to be subject to the applicable legislation, including criminal procedure laws, and the Ministry of the Interior and the FSB have been instructed accordingly. Please get to work.",President,Dmitry Medvedev,http://en.kremlin.ru/events/president/transcripts/statements/10137,,EXTREMISM
China,27-03-2014 00:00,Xi Jinping,Speech by H.E. Xi Jinping President of the People's Republic of China At UNESCO Headquarters,"Your Excellency Madame Irina Bokova, Director-General of UNESCO,
Ladies and Gentlemen,
Dear Friends,

Good morning. It gives me great pleasure to have an opportunity of visiting the UNESCO headquarters. Let me begin by offering Madame Bokova my heartfelt congratulations on her re-election as the Director-General of the Organization and paying my sincere tribute to UNESCO for the extraordinary contribution it has made for greater exchanges and mutual learning among human civilizations.

UNESCO was born 69 years ago when the smoke of the World War against Fascism had barely dissipated. The grisly horror of war forced mankind once again to reflect on the nature of war and peace. Throughout the centuries, people have yearned for lasting peace, but war has haunted mankind every step of their progress. As we speak, many children on this planet are subjected to the horror of armed conflicts. We must do our utmost to keep war as far away as possible from mankind so that children across the world can grow up happily under the sunshine of peace.

The stone wall at the entrance to the UNESCO headquarters carries the inscription of one single message in several languages: Since wars begin in the minds of men, it is in the minds of men that the defenses of peace must be constructed.

As long as the idea of peace can strike deep roots and the sail of peace can be hoisted in the hearts and minds of people all over the world, a strong defense will be built to prevent and stop war. People hoped to promote inter-civilization exchanges, equality of educational opportunities and scientific literacy in order to dispel estrangement, prejudice and hatred, and spread the seeds of the idea of peace. This is precisely why UNESCO was established in the first place.

The aspiration and vision as such deserve our renewed commitment. Not only so, but we must also step up inter-civilization activities in education, science, technology and culture across border, time and space to spread the seeds of the idea of peace far and wide so that they will sprout, take root and grow in the hearts and minds of the world's people, and provide the planet we share with more and more forests of peace.

Since its inception in 1945, UNESCO has faithfully lived up to its mandate and worked untiringly to enhance trust and understanding among the world's peoples and promote exchanges and mutual learning among the various civilizations. China attaches great importance to its cooperation with UNESCO and stands ready to get more involved in its activities. As a token of its support and assistance to Africa, China has decided to increase the number of candidates for the Great Wall Fellowship program provided to African and other developing countries through UNESCO from 25 to 75 each year. We will also work with UNESCO to continue the program of Funds-in-Trust to support Africa.

Ladies and Gentlemen,
Dear Friends,

Civilizations have become richer and more colorful with exchanges and mutual learning. Such exchanges and mutual learning form an important drive for human progress and global peace and development.

To promote exchanges and mutual learning among civilizations, we must adopt a right approach with some important principles. They, in my view, contain the following:

First, civilizations have come in different colors, and such diversity has made exchanges and mutual learning among civilizations relevant and valuable. Just as the sunlight has seven colors, our world is a place of dazzling colors. A civilization is the collective memory of a country or a nation. Throughout history, mankind have created and developed many colorful civilizations, from earlier days of primitive hunting to the period of agriculture, and from booming industrial revolution to the information society. Together, they present a magnificent genetic map of the exciting march of human civilizations.

""A single flower does not make spring, while one hundred flowers in full blossom bring spring to the garden."" If there were only one kind of flower in the world, people will find it boring no matter how beautiful it is. The Chinese civilization and other civilizations in the world are all fruits of human progress.

I have visited the Louvre Museum in France and the Palace Museum in China, both of which house millions of pieces of art treasures. They are attractive because they present the richness of diverse civilizations. Exchanges and mutual learning among civilizations must not be built on the exclusive praise or belittling of one particular civilization. As early as over 2,000 years ago, the Chinese people came to recognize the truth behind the saying that ""it is only natural for things to be different"". Greater exchanges and mutual learning among civilizations can further enrich the colors of various civilizations, heighten people's enjoyment of cultural life, and open up a future with more options.

Second, civilizations are equal, and such equality has made exchanges and mutual learning among civilizations possible. All human civilizations are equal in terms of value. They all have their respective strengths and shortcomings. There is no perfect civilization in the world. Nor is there a civilization that is devoid of any merit. No one civilization can be judged superior to another.

I have visited many places in the world. The best thing I wanted to do is to learn about differing civilizations across the five continents, what make them different and unique, how their people think about the world and life and what they hold dear. I have visited Chichen Itza, a window on the ancient Maya civilization, and the Central Asian city of Samarkand, an epitome of the ancient Islamic civilization. It is my keenly-felt conviction that an attitude of equality and modesty is required if one wants to truly understand the various civilizations. Taking a condescending attitude toward a civilization can not help anyone to appreciate its essence but may risk antagonizing it. Both history and reality show that pride and prejudice are two biggest obstacles to exchanges and mutual learning among civilizations.

Third, civilizations are inclusive, and such inclusiveness has given exchanges and mutual learning among civilizations the needed drive to move forward. The ocean is vast for it refuses no rivers. All civilizations are crystallizations of mankind's hard work and wisdom. Every civilization is unique. Copying other civilizations mechanically or blindly is like cutting one's toes just to fit his shoes, which is not only impossible but also highly detrimental. All achievements of civilizations deserve our respect and must be treasured.

History tells us that only through exchanges and mutual learning can a civilization be filled with vitality. If all civilizations can uphold inclusiveness, the so-called ""clash of civilizations"" will be out of the question and the harmony of civilizations will become reality. This is like what we Chinese often say, ""Radish or cabbage, each to his own delight.""

Having gone through over 5,000 years of vicissitudes, the Chinese civilization has always kept to its original root. As the unique cultural identity of the Chinese nation, it contains our most profound cultural pursuits and provides us with abundant nourishment for existence and development. The Chinese civilization, though born on the soil of China, has come to its present form through constant exchanges and mutual learning with other civilizations.

In the 2nd century B.C., China began working on the Silk Road leading to the Western Regions. In 138 B.C. and 119 B.C., Envoy Zhang Qian of the Han Dynasty made two trips to those regions, spreading the Chinese culture there and bringing into China grape, alfalfa, pomegranate, flax, sesame and other products. In the Western Han Dynasty, China's merchant fleets sailed as far as India and Sri Lanka where they traded China's silk for colored glaze, pearls and other products. The Tang Dynasty saw dynamic interactions between China and other countries. According to historical documents, the dynasty exchanged envoys with over 70 countries, and Chang'an, the capital of Tang, bustled with envoys, merchants and students from other countries. Exchanges of such a magnitude helped the spread of the Chinese culture to the rest of the world and the introduction into China of the cultures and products from other countries. In the early 15th century, Zheng He, the famous navigator of China's Ming Dynasty, made seven expeditions to the Western Seas, reaching many Southeast Asian countries and even Kenya on the east coast of Africa. These trips left behind many good stories of friendly exchanges between the people of China and countries along the route. In late Ming Dynasty and early Qing Dynasty, the Chinese people began to learn modern science and technology with great zeal, as the European knowledge of astronomy, medicine, mathematics, geometry and geography were being introduced into China, which helped broaden the horizon of the Chinese people. Thereafter, exchanges and mutual learning between the Chinese civilization and other civilizations became more frequent. There were indeed conflicts, frictions, bewilderment and denial in this process. But the more dominant features of the period were learning, digestion, integration and innovation.

Buddhism originated in ancient India. After it was introduced into China, the religion went through an extended period of integrated development with the indigenous Confucianism and Taoism and finally became the Buddhism with Chinese characteristics, thus making a deep impact on the religious belief, philosophy, literature, art, etiquette and customs of the Chinese people. Xuanzang (Hiuen Tsang), the Tang monk who endured untold sufferings as he went on a pilgrimage to the west for Buddhist scriptures, gave full expression to the determination and fortitude of the Chinese people to learn from other cultures. I am sure that you have all heard about the Chinese classics Journey to the West, which was written on the basis of his stories. The Chinese people have enriched Buddhism in the light of Chinese culture and developed some special Buddhist thoughts. Moreover, they also helped Buddhism spread from China to Japan, Korea, Southeast Asia and beyond.

In the course of some two thousand years and more, Buddhism, Islam and Christianity have been introduced into China successively, which allowed the country's music, painting and literature to benefit from the advantages of other civilizations. China's freehand oil painting is an innovative combination of China's traditional painting and the Western oil painting, and the works of Xu Beihong and other masters have been widely acclaimed. China's Four Great Inventions, namely, papermaking, gunpowder, movable-type printing and compass, led to changes in the world, including the European Renaissance. China's philosophy, literature, medicine, silk, porcelain and tea reached the West and became part of people's daily life. The Travels of Marco Polo generated a widespread interest in China.

I assume you have all heard of China's terracotta warriors, the buried legions of Emperor Qin. After his visit to the site, President Chirac of France said that a visit to Egypt will not be complete without seeing the pyramids, and that a visit to China will not be complete without seeing the terracotta warriors. In 1987, this national treasure of China, buried underground for over two thousand years, was put on the UNESCO World Cultural Heritage list. There are many more proud Chinese achievements that have been included in the World Cultural Heritage list, the World Intangible Cultural Heritage list and the Memory of the World list. Here, I would like to express my heartfelt thanks to UNESCO for its contribution to the preservation and dissemination of the Chinese civilization.

Ladies and Gentlemen,
Friends,

Today, we live in a world with different cultures, ethnic groups, skin colors, religions and social systems, and the people of various countries have become members of an intimate community of shared destiny.

The Chinese have long come to appreciate the wisdom of ""harmony without uniformity"". Zuo Qiuming, a Chinese historian who lived 2,500 years ago, recorded in the Chronicle of Zuo the following comments by Yan Ying, Prime Minister of the State of Qi during the Spring and Autumn Period: ""Achieving harmony is like preparing the thick soup. Only with the right amount of water, fire, vinegar, meat sauce, salt and plum can fish and meat be cooked with the right taste."" ""It is the same when it comes to music. Only by combining the sounds of different instruments with the right rhythm and pitch as well as tone and style can you produce an excellent melody."" ""Who can eat the soup with nothing but water in it? What ear can tolerate the same tone played repeatedly on one instrument?""

There are 200-odd countries and regions, over 2,500 ethnic groups and a multitude of religions in the world today. We can hardly imagine if this world has only one lifestyle, one language, one kind of music and one style of costume.

Victor Hugo once said, ""There is a prospect greater than the sea, and it is the sky; there is a prospect greater than the sky, and it is the human soul."" Indeed, we need a mind that is broader than the sky as we approach different civilizations. Civilizations are like water, moistening everything silently. We need to encourage different civilizations to respect each other and live together in harmony while promoting their exchanges and mutual learning as a bridge of friendship among peoples, a driving force behind human society, and a strong bond for world peace. We should seek wisdom and nourishment from various civilizations to provide support and consolation for people's mind, and work together to tackle the challenges facing mankind.

In 1987, 20 exquisite pieces of colored glaze were excavated at the underground chamber of Famen Temple in China's Shaanxi Province. These East Roman and Islamic relics were brought into China during the Tang Dynasty. Marveling at these exotic relics, I thought hard and concluded that as we approach the world's different civilizations, we should not limit ourselves to just admiring the exquisiteness of the objects involved. Rather, we should try to learn and appreciate the cultural significance behind them. Instead of satisfying ourselves with their artistic presentation of people's life in the past, we should do our best to breathe new life into their inherent spirit.

Ladies and Gentlemen,
Friends,

Napoleon Bonaparte once said, ""There are only two forces in the world, the sword and the spirit. In the long run the sword will always be conquered by the spirit."" We should develop education more actively. Education can open people's mind, impart knowledge, and cultivate temperament. The continued process of learning will enable our people to better appreciate the value of different civilizations. In this sense, education is an effective vehicle for the continuation and creation of civilizations. We should develop science and technology more vigorously. Scientific advancement and innovation can help people understand themselves and the world and be in a stronger position to change their society for the better. The continued process of exploiting nature will enable our people to master still more knowledge and skills. In this sense, science and technology are a powerful tool to make the world a better place for mankind. We should promote cultural undertakings more energetically. Cultural exchanges can help open our hearts to each other, broaden our horizon and build greater consensus among us. The continued process of cultivating people morally and intellectually will result in a higher standard of humanity. In this sense, culture is a big booster for human progress.

Ladies and Gentlemen,
Friends,

The Chinese people are striving to fulfill the Chinese dream of the great renewal of the Chinese nation. The Chinese dream is about prosperity of the country, rejuvenation of the nation, and happiness of the people. It reflects both the ideal of the Chinese people today and our time-honored tradition to seek constant progress.

The Chinese dream will be realized through balanced development and mutual reinforcement of material and cultural progress. Without the continuation and development of civilization or the promotion and prosperity of culture, the Chinese dream will not come true. Forefathers of the Chinese nation yearned for a world of great harmony in which people are free from want and follow a high moral standard. In the Chinese civilization, people's cultural pursuit has always been part of their life and social ideals. So the realization of the Chinese dream is a process of both material and cultural development. As China continues to make economic and social progress, the Chinese civilization will keep pace with the times and acquire greater vitality.

A civilization carries on its back the soul of a country or nation. It needs to be passed on from one generation to the next. Yet more importantly, it needs to keep pace with the times and innovate with courage. As we pursue the Chinese dream, the Chinese people will encourage creative shifts and innovative development of the Chinese civilization in keeping with the progress of the times. We need to inject new vitality into the Chinese civilization by energizing all cultural elements that transcend time, space and national borders and that possess both perpetual appeal and current value, and we need to bring all collections in our museums, all heritage structures across our lands and all records in our classics to life. In this way, the Chinese civilization, together with the rich and colorful civilizations created by the people of other countries, will provide mankind with the right cultural guidance and strong motivation.

Ladies and Gentlemen,
Friends,

As an old Chinese poem goes, ""When I glance at the visage of vernal breeze, I know that a thousand flowers of purple and red set spring aglow."" UNESCO will mark its 70th anniversary next year. I am confident that under the stewardship of Director-General Bokova, the organization will make still more achievements in its efforts to promote exchanges and mutual learning among civilizations and advance the cause of peace in the world.

Thank you.",President,Xi Jinping,https://www.fmprc.gov.cn/mfa_eng/wjdt_665385/zyjh_665391/t1142560.shtml,,OTHERS
United Kingdom,30-Jun-20,Boris Johnson,PM Economy Speech: 30 June 2020,"It may seem a bit premature to make a speech now about Britain after Covid when that deceptively nasty disease is still rampant in other countries when global case numbers are growing fast and when many in this country are nervous – rightly – about more outbreaks whether national or local like the flare-up in Leicester whereas I promised we are putting on the brakes and I thank the people of Leicester for their forbearance and yet we cannot continue simply to be prisoners of this crisis We are preparing now slowly and cautiously to come out of hibernation and I believe it is absolutely vital for us now to set out the way ahead so that everyone can think and plan for the future – short, medium and long term because if the covid crisis has taught us one thing it is that this country needs to be ready for what may be coming and we need to be able to move with levels of energy and speed that we have not needed for generations And I know that there are plenty of things that people say and will say that we got wrong and we owe that discussion and that honesty to the tens of thousands who have died before their time to the families who have lost loved ones and of course there must be time to learn the lessons, and we will but I also know that some things went right – and emphatically right I think of the speed and efficiency with which we put up the Nightingales – ten days for a hospital – I think of the drive and inventiveness of the British companies who rose to the ventilator challenge with three brand new production lines called into being within the space of eight weeks with a new model of ventilator developed in March and granted regulatory approval in weeks, and 9,500 of them now made I pay tribute to the pace at which Oxford university managed to perform the trials for dexamethasone the world’s first demonstrably life-saving treatment for the disease I am in awe of the problem-crunching fury with which HMRC and the Treasury created the furlough scheme and all the other means of support world-leading standards of protection for jobs and incomes set up in a matter of days There were brilliant and determined individuals who more than rose to the challenge of this crisis there were thousands and thousands who put their hearts and souls into it and yet our debt is not just to them It is not just even to the devotion and love of the NHS and the care workers who saved so many lives including my own There was one big reason in the end that we were able to avert a far worse disaster and that was because the whole of society came together to make a sacrifice on behalf of those who might be particularly vulnerable – particularly the elderly We all knew went we went into lockdown that there would be huge economic costs We could see what would happen and yet we did it, we the United Kingdom in a display of solidarity not seen since world war two and so today we must combine that energy and drive with that concentrated burst of collective willpower that protected the NHS controlled the virus and saved literally hundreds of thousands of lives and we must work fast because we have already seen the vertiginous drop in GDP and we know that people are worried now about their jobs and their businesses and we are waiting as if between the flash of lightning and the thunderclap with our hearts in our mouths for the full economic reverberations to appear and we must use this moment – now – this interval to plan our response and to fix of course the problems that were most brutally illuminated in that covid lightning flash the problems in our social care system the parts of government that seemed to respond so sluggishly so that sometimes it seemed like that recurring bad dream when you are telling your feet to run and your feet won’t move and yet we must also go further and realise that if we are to recover fully if we are to deal with the coming economic aftershock then this covid crisis is also the moment to address the problems in our country that we have failed to tackle for decades because it is one of the most extraordinary features of the UK – in so many ways the greatest place on earth – that we tolerate such yawning gaps between the best and the rest We have some of the best and most productive companies in the world – and yet we are not as nationally productive as many of our global competitors We have the world’s most brilliant medical minds, the world’s best pharmaceutical companies, our doctors and treatments are the best in the world and yet we have so many millions who have to wait for too long to see their GP – even before the new waiting lists produced by the crisis We have umpteen fantastic, globally outstanding universities and yet too many degree courses are not now delivering value and for a century we have failed to invest enough in further education and give young people the practical training and further education they need We have a capital city that was, is and will be in so many ways the capital of the world theatre, finance, tech, restaurants you name it, London leads the world and yet too many parts of this country have felt left behind neglected, unloved, as though someone had taken a strategic decision that their fate did not matter as much as the metropolis so I want you to know that this government not only has a vision to change this country for the better we have a mission to unite and to level up the mission on which we were elected last year and we have a plan and in advancing that plan now I just serve notice that we will not be responding to this crisis with what people called austerity we are not going to try to cheese-pare our way out of trouble because the world has moved on since 2008 and we not only face a new and in some ways a far bigger challenge and I can tell everybody, businesses that next week the Chancellor will be setting out our immediate plan to support the economy through the first phase of our recovery but this moment also gives us a much greater chance to be radical and to do things differently to build back better to build back bolder and so we will be doubling down on our strategy we will double down on levelling up and when I say level up, I don’t mean attacking our great companies I don’t mean impeding the success of London – far from it or launching some punitive raid on the wealth creators I don’t believe in tearing people down any more than I believe in tearing down statues that are part of our heritage let alone a statue of our greatest wartime leader I believe in building people up giving everyone growing up in this country the opportunity they need whoever you are, whatever your ethnicity, whatever your background and there are certain things that are indispensable for that opportunity the hospital you are born in the schools you go to the safety of the streets where you grow up and this government has not forgotten that we were elected to build 40 new hospitals and we will – Matt Hancock is setting out the list in the next few days, and that is just the beginning We will continue and step up the biggest ever programme of funding the NHS and we won’t wait to fix the problem of social care that every government has flunked for the last 30 years We will end the injustice that some people have to sell their homes to finance the costs of their care while others don’t We are finalising our plans and we will build a cross-party consensus We will look after those who have looked after us and at the same time We will build the foundations now for future prosperity to make this country – a Britain that is fully independent and self-governing for the first time in 45 years the most attractive place to live and to invest and to set up a company with the most motivated and highly skilled workforce and so we are investing massively now in education with over £14bn for primary and secondary education between now and 2023 and today with a new ten year school building programme beginning now with £1bn for the first 50 schools and a vast £1.5 bn programme of refurbishing our dilapidated Further Education sector – dilapidated in many places, but not here of course because it is time the system recognised that talent and genius are expressed as much by hand and by eye as they are in a spreadsheet or an essay so when I say unite and level up when I say build up people and build up talent I want to end the current injustice that means a pupil from a London state school is now 50 per cent more likely to go to a top university than a pupil from the west midlands and that is not only unjust it is such a waste of human talent We will unleash the potential of the entire country and that means basic things, cracking down again on the crime that blights too many streets and too many lives and we will get on with our plan to recruit 20,000 more police officers – we have already found 3,000 and I thank them for everything they are doing and have done in this crisis and we will back our police all the way and give our justice system the powers we need to end the lunacy that stops us – for instance – deporting some violent offenders just as we have already stopped the automatic early release of terrorists We will make this country safer We will build the hospitals build the schools and the colleges but we will also build back greener and build a more beautiful Britain we will protect the landscape with flood defences and plant 30,000 hectares of trees every year creating a new patchwork of woodlands to enchant and re-energise the soul and in those towns that feel left behind we have plans to invest in their centres and with new academy schools, new green buses, new broadband and we want to make them places where people have the confidence to stay, to raise their families and to start businesses and not to feel that the action is all in the cities or the metropolis and yet I don’t think that this crisis has ended the desire or need to move around swiftly and efficiently We have learned the wonders of Zoom and MS Teams the joys of muting or unmuting our colleagues at key moments but we still need to travel and more than ever the time has come when we must unite and level up in the most basic way possible not just with HS2 and NPR but with better roads, better rail unblocking the central Manchester bottleneck that delays services across the north and 4000 brand new zero carbon buses and a massive new plan for cycleways and we will build and rebuild those vital connexions to every part of the UK because now is the moment to strengthen that incredible partnership between England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland and I know that some have sometimes played up the legitimate variations in the response between the devolved administrations but when you look at the whole effort you can see the absolutely vital role of that union and that partnership It is our fantastic UK armed services that have played such a crucial role in this crisis running the test centres, building the hospitals, transporting people from the Shetlands to the right Covid wards It was the might of the UK Treasury that set up that furlough scheme – in all corners of the country and sent massive and immediate extra funding to all four parts of the UK I believe the union has more than showed its worth and a prosperous and united Kingdom must be a connected Kingdom and that is why we are now accelerating projects from South West to the North East from Wales, to Scotland, to Northern Ireland and to drive economic growth in all parts of the country we will carry out a study of all future road, rail, air and cross-sea links between our all our four parts of the UK When did a government first promise to dual the A1 to Scotland ? It was 1992 Well this government is going to do it and it is this infrastructure revolution that will allow us to end that other chronic failure of the British state decade after decade in which we have failed to build enough homes We will build fantastic new homes on brownfield sites and other areas that with better transport and other infrastructure could frankly be suitable and right for development and address that intergenerational injustice and help young people get on the housing ladder in the way that their parents and grandparents could and it is to galvanise this whole process that this government will shortly bring forward the most radical reforms of our planning system since the end of the second world war Yes, we will insist on beautiful and low carbon homes but covid has taught us the cost of delay why does UK public procurement take 50 per cent longer than in Germany? why are UK capital costs typically between 10 and 30 per cent higher than other European projects? Why is HS2 – transformational though it will be – going to cost us the equivalent of the GDP of Sri Lanka? Why are we so slow at building homes by comparison with other European countries? In 2018 we built 2.25 homes per 1000 people Germany managed 3.6, the Netherlands 3.8, France 6.8 I tell you why - because time is money, and the newt-counting delays in our system are a massive drag on the productivity and the prosperity of this country and so we will build better and build greener but we will also build faster and that is why the Chancellor and I have set up Project Speed to scythe through red tape and get things done and with every home we make, every mile of full fibre broadband that we lay with every flood-defending culvert that we dig with every railway station, hospital or school that we build we will of course be tackling the next wave of this crisis by helping to create thousands of high-paid high-skilled jobs because we know in our hearts that the furloughing cannot go on forever and as the economy recovers we also know that the jobs that many people had in January are also not coming back or at least not in that form and we know that is our biggest and most immediate economic challenge that we face and so we will offer an Opportunity Guarantee so that every young person has the chance of apprenticeship or an in-work placement so that they maintain the skills and confidence they need to find the job that is right for them I am conscious as I say all this that it sounds like a prodigious amount of government intervention It sounds like a New Deal and all I can say is that if so, then that is how it is meant to sound and to be because that is what the times demand a government that is powerful and determined and that puts its arms around people at a time of crisis that tackles homelessness the inequalities that drive people to food banks because it is time now not just for a New Deal but a Fair Deal for the British people and we can do all this now partly because of the prudent management of the economy in the last ten years but also because we are planning to invest now when the cost of borrowing allows it and when the returns are greatest because that is the way both now and in the medium term to drive the growth, to fuel the animal spirits and the long-term business investment on which our future prosperity depends my friends I am not a communist I believe it is also the job of government to create the conditions for free market enterprise and yes of course we clap for our NHS but under this government we also applaud those who make our NHS possible our innovators our wealth creators our capitalists and financiers because in the end it is their willingness to take risks with their own money that will be crucial for our future success This is Dudley the birthplace of Abraham Darby who massively accelerated the industrial revolution by using coke instead of charcoal to produce pig iron (it may not sound like it, but it’s also the greener option) and today Dudley remains at the cutting edge of green technology that is increasingly driving the whole of the UK economy It was here in 2011 that a company called Westfield produced the world’s first commercially viable electric racing car and the whole of the West Midlands is now a global centre of battery technology and batteries for EVs and that is the vision of Mayor Andy Street, and we will back that vision This is a government that backs Britain, and believes in British innovation and this summer we will be creating a new science funding agency to back high risk, high reward projects because in the next 100 years the most successful societies will be the most innovative societies and we in this country have the knack of innovation we lead the world in quantum computing, in life sciences, in genomics, in AI, space satellites, net zero planes, and in the long term solutions to global warming wind, solar, hydrogen technology carbon capture and storage, nuclear and as part of our mission to reach Net Zero CO2 emissions by 2050, we should set ourselves the goal now of producing the world’s first zero emission long haul passenger plane Jet Zero, let’s do it and though we are no longer a military superpower we can be a science superpower but we must end the chasm between invention and application that means a brilliant British discovery disappears to California and becomes a billion dollar American company or a Chinese company and we need now a new dynamic commercial spirit to make the most of UK breakthroughs so that British ideas produce new British industries and British jobs And yet to achieve all that from where we are now we must get on first with the hard and painstaking work of re-opening our economy and I feel the urgency and impatience of all those sectors that are still being held back the theatres, the arts, the salons, the gyms, the cricket clubs, sectors in which we lead the world and yet which suffer because they depend on the very physical proximity and contact that Covid makes so difficult and I say to everybody in those sectors we will get you going as fast as we can we will get life back to normal for as many as possible as fast as possible But as we approach July 4 I am afraid that the dangers – as we can see in Leicester - have not gone away the virus is out there still circling like a shark in the water and it will take all our collective discipline and resolve to keep that virus at bay and if we can and get on to the next phase of recovery then we can get on all the faster to the next phase and to the delivery of our plan This is a government that is wholly committed not just to defeating coronavirus but to using this crisis finally to tackle this country’s great unresolved challenges of the last three decades to build the homes to fix the NHS to solve social care to tackle the skills crisis to mend the indefensible gap in opportunity and productivity and connectivity between the regions of the UK to unite and level up and to that end we will build, build, build build back better build back greener build back faster and to do that at the pace that this moment requires we need now to distil the very best of the psychic energy of the last few months let’s take the zap and élan of the armed services who helped to build the Nightingales let’s take the selflessness and the love of the health and the care workers and the charities the public spirit and the good humour of the entire population and let’s brew them together with the superhuman energy of Captain Tom bounding around his garden at the age of 100 and raising millions for charity let’s take that combination, that spirit bottle it, swig it and I believe we will have found if not quite a magic potion, at least the right formula to get us through these dark times And I must stress that there will still be some tough times ahead and to work this whole plan through will take effort, and nerve, and patience and no we won’t get everything right we certainly won’t get everything right first time but this is the moment to be ambitious to believe in Britain to rise to the scale of the challenge and the opportunity If we deliver this plan together then we will together build our way back to health We will not just bounce back We will bounce forward – stronger and better and more united than ever before.

USA,26-07-2017 00:00,Donald Trump,Remarks by President Trump in Jobs Announcement,"THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you very much.  I want to thank our great Vice President.  Thank you to Speaker Ryan.  We’re working very, very closely.  We’re getting a lot done.

Governor Walker has been so tremendous from the first time we announced that Terry even had a small amount of interest in going into this country someplace.  And, you know, when you give that to Governor Walker, it’s pretty much of a done deal.  (Laughter.)

Ron Johnson, senator — he’s been so helpful to us on a thing that you haven’t heard too much about recently — healthcare.  And I think we’re doing okay, Ron.  I’m hearing good things.  I’m hearing good things.

Secretary Mnuchin, Secretary Ross, all of the congressmen — great congressmen — and senators we have in the audience:  Thank you very much.

And thanks especially to my friend — one of the great businessmen anywhere in the world — Terry Gou.  (Applause.)  I would see Terry, and I’d say, Terry, you have to give us a couple of those massive — these are massive — places that you do such great work with.  And he’s going to be doing that in a state that’s very close to my heart — Wisconsin.  So we’re very happy.  One of the big job producers anywhere at any time, Scott.  So I know it’s going to be fantastic for the people.

This is a great day for American workers and manufacturing, and for everyone who believes in the concept and the label, “Made in the USA.”  (Applause.)

Today, I am pleased to announce that Foxconn, a world leader in manufacturing for computers, communications, and consumer electronics — one of the truly great companies of the world — will build a state-of-the-art manufacturing facility for the production of LCD panel products in Wisconsin, investing many, many billions of dollars right here in America and creating thousands of jobs.  And I mean American jobs — that’s what we want.  (Applause.)

Another big investor in our country — Steve Wynn, would you stand up?  (Applause.)  He’s raising so much money for our great Republican Party.  Andrea, please stand up.  Please.  Thank you.  Thank you, Steve.  Done a great job.  You’ve done a great job, Steve.  Thank you.

Foxconn will invest in southeast Wisconsin while a larger facility is constructed over the coming years.  And that facility is currently under negotiation.  It will be about the biggest there is anywhere.  The company’s initial investment of more than $10 billion will create 3,000 jobs, at a minimum, with the potential for up to 13,000 jobs in the very near future.  The construction of this facility represents the return of LCD electronics and electronics manufacturing to the United States, the country that we love.  That’s where we want our jobs.

To make such an incredible investment, Chairman Gou put his faith and confidence in the future of the American economy.  In other words, if I didn’t get elected, he definitely would not be spending $10 billion.  (Laughter and applause.)

His great company has seen our — you know, you see exactly what I’m saying — our administration’s work to remove job-killing regulations — he’s been watching — to institute Buy American and Hire American, and all of those policies, and to pursue the steps necessary to revitalize American industry, including repealing and replacing Obamacare — we better get that done, fellas, please.  Mike, we need that so badly — cutting taxes, fixing our trade deals, and rebuilding our infrastructure.  We’ll be submitting an infrastructure bill in the not-very-distant future.  We’re going to be submitting a tax bill in the very near future.  (Applause.)

When this investment is complete, Foxconn has the potential to create more manufacturing jobs than we’ve seen in many, many decades.

Chairman Gou, I thank you for your investment in the American worker.  They appreciate it.  They will not let you down.  They never let us down.  There is nobody like the American worker.

Terry Gou told me that he believes in America — and he really believes in America — and that, as a great entrepreneur — one of the greatest in the world, by the way — he won’t say it, but I’ll say — one of the great entrepreneurs of the world — he has a real bond with the administration and with Americans.  Foxconn joins a growing list of industry leaders who understand that America’s capabilities are limitless and that America’s workers are unmatched, and that America’s most prosperous days are just ahead.  We are going to have some very, very magnificent decades.

Thank you all for being here.  Thank you, Terry.  And thank you to Foxconn.  God bless the United States of America.  God bless you all.  Thank you very much.  Thank you.

China,26-05-2016 00:00,H.E. Wang Yi,Remarks by Foreign Minister Wang Yi At the Media Briefing on the G20 Hangzhou Summit,"Dear Guests,
Friends from the Press,

Good morning!

Today is 26 May, and tomorrow will mark the 100-day countdown of the G20 Hangzhou Summit. Indeed, the Summit is drawing near. On 4-5 September, President Xi Jinping will be joined by leaders from other G20 members, guest countries and international organizations in Hangzhou to discuss ways to advance global economic cooperation and development. The world will turn its eyes to the G20, to China and to Hangzhou.

The G20 is widely recognized as the premier forum for global economic governance. This can be well illustrated by the following figures: the G20 accounts for two thirds of the world population, 60% of total land mass, 85% of global GDP and 80% of international trade. Hence, it is fair to say that the performance of G20 economies has a direct bearing on the well-being of the world economy and that cooperation among G20 members decides the future of international economic cooperation.

The G20 is different from previous cooperation mechanisms. Here, developed countries and developing countries sit at the same table as equal partners, and discuss and decide on international economic matters on an equal footing. This reflects a major change in the world economic pattern and represents historical progress in keeping with the trend of our times.

The G20 marks a departure from the old logic of ""beggar thy neighbor"". In the face of the international financial crisis, G20 members have coordinated monetary and fiscal policies, pushed ahead reform of international financial institutions, and brought the world economy from the brink of precipice. This spirit of partnership and solidarity in times of difficulty is the most valued asset of the G20.

So far, the G20 has held ten summits. This year, it is China's turn to play host.

Right now, the world economy is in a crucial transition period with both opportunities and challenges. First, the old approach of stimulating growth merely through fiscal and monetary policies has become less and less effective. Second, policies of the world's major economies have clearly diverged, making it harder to form synergy. Third, trade and investment protectionism is rearing its head, and the building of an open economy remains a long and daunting task. And fourth, the world economy, though recovered somewhat from the crisis, is still weak in growth and under constant downward pressure.

At this crucial juncture, the international community is full of expectations of this year's G20 Summit, hoping that outcomes from the Hangzhou Summit will reenergize the world economy. As the host, we are keenly aware of the heavy responsibilities on our shoulders.

At the Hangzhou Summit, we would like to focus on the core challenges and outstanding issues confronting the world economy and work with all parties to seek common solutions and contribute China's wisdom. We aim to steady growth in the near term by addressing the symptoms and add momentum to the long term by treating the root causes. We want to facilitate G20's transition from a crisis-response mechanism to one focusing on long-term governance so as to better lead world economic growth and international economic cooperation.

At the Antalya Summit last year, President Xi spoke about the theme and key priorities of the Hangzhou Summit as well as China's basic approach. On 1 December last year, the very day China took over the G20 presidency, President Xi delivered a special message, expounding on China's vision and considerations. China chose ""Toward an Innovative, Invigorated, Interconnected and Inclusive World Economy"" as the theme of the Hangzhou Summit and identified four key priorities, namely, ""breaking a new path for growth"", ""more effective and efficient global economic and financial governance"", ""robust international trade and investment"" and ""inclusive and interconnected development"". The theme and topics proposed by China have received strong endorsement and support from other G20 members. They all agree that China's vision embodies long-term, strategic considerations and demonstrates a broad perspective and ambitious goals.

G20 activities run through the whole year of China's presidency, with the culmination in the Hangzhou Summit. Throughout the year, 66 events will be held in 20 Chinese cities. Among them, there are 23 ministerial-level meetings, including four G20 ministers meetings, five Sherpa meetings, four Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors meetings, four finance and central bank deputies meetings and six large-scale side events. Forty-three working group meetings in various fields will be held. Altogether nearly tens of thousands of people will get involved. These meetings will lay the ground for the Hangzhou Summit from different areas and perspectives and help translate consensus into action.

Since assuming presidency last December, we have held two Sherpa meetings and two Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors meetings. Working groups on development, trade and investment, employment, energy and infrastructure have met several times as well. The International Financial Architecture Working Group, dormant for years, has been reactivated. Three newly-established special working groups on innovation, new industrial revolution and digital economy have started their work. We are now halfway through the Chinese presidency, and much progress has already been made. The theme and key priorities proposed by China have won widespread support. The framework and main areas of summit outcomes have taken shape. Arrangements for the main events have been decided, and venue construction is progressing according to plan. Here I want to assure you that China is ready and Hangzhou is ready to welcome our distinguished guests from all over the world.

In the next 100 days, summit preparations will enter the final sprint. We will hold another two Sherpa meetings in June and early September and a Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors meeting in July. Starting from June, G20 meetings for agriculture ministers, energy ministers, employment ministers and trade ministers will be held in quick succession. Major side events such as the B20 business forum, the Labor 20, the Think-tank 20, the Youth 20, the Women 20 and the Civil 20 will follow. All these activities are important to increase consensus and solidify achievements, which will lead us to one common destination - the 11th G20 Summit to be held in Hangzhou on 4-5 September.

You might be interested to learn what results the Hangzhou Summit will deliver and what impacts it will have on the world economy. In preparing for the summit, we aim to be problem-oriented. In response to policy divergence, we will push for greater macroeconomic policy coordination to avoid negative spill-over effect. In view of the gap between old and new growth drivers, we will champion reform and innovation to unleash new impetus and achieve strong, sustainable and balanced growth. In light of the risks and uncertainties in the world economy, we will strive to improve global economic governance and safeguard international financial stability. To address sluggish trade and investment and resurging protectionism, we will reinvigorate the two engines of growth and build an open world economy. On the issue of development gap, we will push the G20 to take the lead and play an exemplary role in global cooperation on sustainable development.

With these goals in mind, we are working with all sides to deliver ten major outcomes.

First, work out a blueprint for innovation-driven growth. ""Breaking a new path for development"" has been made a main item on this year's summit agenda. It will be the first time for the G20 to focus on the medium-to-long term driving force for global growth. It is good to note that China's initiative has received increasing recognition from other G20 members. At the meetings of innovation, new industrialization and digital economy working groups held in the middle of this month, members agreed in principle that a blueprint for innovation-driven growth needs to be drawn. The blueprint will not only lock on the fresh impetus to global growth but will also lay out specific action plans through which to boost innovation, new industrial revolution and the digital economy. This will enable G20 members to come together toward a common vision of opening up a new path for global growth with concrete actions and through specific mechanisms.

Second, adopt an action plan for the implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. As the biggest developing country, China is keen to see development issues receiving greater attention and input from the G20. It is hoped that the summit will be recorded with two ""first times"", i.e. the first time for the development issue to take a prominent position within the global macro-policy framework, and the first time for an action plan to be drawn on implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. We hope that collective and individual actions on the part of the G20 will give a strong impetus to the UN sustainable development agenda. A bigger number of developing countries will be invited to take part in the Hangzhou Summit so as to make the summit more representative of developing countries in the world. The message China hopes to convey is that the G20 belongs not only to its 20 members but also to the whole world, and that the G20 cares about not just its own interests but the common development of all in the world.

Third, identify priority areas and set up guiding principles as well as an indicator system for structural reforms. Agreement has been reached on the nine priority areas for G20 structural reforms, and a host of guiding principles as well as an indicator system are being worked out to monitor the progress and real effect. That will in fact be the first time in the G20 history. What it represents is the emphasis given to both the short and long-term impetus to driving growth. While continuing to use proper fiscal and monetary policies to meet the immediate challenges, priority may also be given to structural reforms as a way to unleash the medium and long term potential of growth.

Fourth, adopt a global trade growth strategy. Trade, like the blood that drives the world economy, is crucial for building an open global economy. For years, global trade has been growing at a pace slower than that of the world economy. Trade and investment will be on this year's summit agenda, and regular platforms such as the G20 trade ministers' meeting and the trade and investment working group have also been planned. The global trade growth strategy is aimed at reversing the downward growth of global trade by coordinating trade and investment policies, taking facilitating measures to lower trade costs and increasing trade financing.

Fifth, lay out the guiding principles for global investment policies. Currently, there are some over 3,200 bilateral treaties to regulate international investment, something that does little service to facilitating cross-border cooperation on investment. China hopes that the summit could introduce a set of guiding principles for global investment, which, as the first framework of multilateral investment norms, would have a pioneering effect on global investment. Of course, it might be some time before these norms become more substantiate, but the beginning of such a process does mean something important.

Sixth, deepen reform of the international financial architecture. Since the time China took over the G20 Presidency, the RMB has been included into the SDR basket and major progress has been made in the reform of long-delayed reform formula. On such basis, China encourages the IMF to complete its 15th General Review of Quotas, with a view to strengthening the global financial safety net and upholding international financial stability.

Seventh, launch three-pronged anti-corruption cooperation. The summit will work out the high-level principles on international fugitive repatriation and asset recovery, set up a research center on anti -corruption cooperation and make an anti-corruption action plan (2017-2018) to guide anti-corruption efforts with guiding principles and through due mechanisms and concrete actions, in order to ensure that G20 countries provide no safe heaven for corruption offenders.

Eighth, initiate cooperation to support industrialization of Africa and least developed countries (LDCs) in the world. For Africa and LDCs, it is imperative to speed up industrialization and build up capacity for home-grown development. This year, China will encourage G20 members to help Africa and LDCs speed up industrialization, reduce poverty and pursue sustainable development by means of capacity building, investment increase and infrastructure improvement.

Ninth, formulate an entrepreneurship action plan. It is China's strategy to encourage nationwide entrepreneurship and innovation. A G20 entrepreneurship action plan, formulated this year, will give strong stimulus to global growth and job creation, and will provide an important platform for countries to exchange best practice and experience. The action plan raises a number of policy recommendations and comes up with specific ways of implementation, which could serve as a source of reference for countries concerned.

Tenth, push for early entry-into-force of the Paris Agreement on climate change. With the initiative of China and the support of all parties concerned, the G20 Sherpa Meeting this April has issued the G20's first ever Presidency Statement on Climate Change, by which parties pledged to sign, on 22 April or at an early date afterwards, the Paris Agreement, and to complete domestic approval procedures as early as possible. Such a move has been acknowledged and welcomed by UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon in a special statement. By now, most G20 members and guest countries have signed on the Paris Agreement. China urges parties involved to quicken the pace of domestic approval so that the Agreement could enter into force at an early date to coordinate actions and contribute to international cooperation on climate change.

In addition, at this year's first G20 Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors Meeting held in February, parties agreed to resort to all policy tools, fiscal, monetary and structural reforms alike, to avoid competitive monetary devaluation and enhance policy consultation on exchange rates. This has been the G20's strongest message in recent years about increasing macroeconomic policy coordination. It has sent a positive signal of unity, which helped stabilize expectation and boost confidence, and was well received by the international economic circle and the media. We hope the Hangzhou Summit could consolidate and expand such outcome and rally efforts to strengthen defense for the world economy.

In this year, China has also encouraged the G20 to formulate action plans or cooperation initiatives in green finance, inclusive finance, investment and infrastructure, energy accessibility, renewable energy, energy efficiency and food security, as part of the joint endeavor to enhance international economic cooperation and strengthen global economic governance.

In addition to the above outcomes, the Hangzhou Summit will feature the following two highlights:

One is the rich and colorful events that will be arranged. When an emerging mechanism like the G20 comes to China, it will echo with the time-honored civilization. A summit in China will bear witness to human progress and write a brilliant chapter in the G20 history. The summit will be held back to back with a B20 business forum, the biggest of its kind, on how to boost global growth. President Xi Jinping will make a keynote speech at the B20 business forum. An informal BRICS leaders meeting will be held before the summit, and the summit itself will run from the afternoon of September 4 to the afternoon of September 5. President Xi Jinping will chair the summit and brief the Chinese and international media on its outcomes after the summit closes. In addition, cultural events of distinct Chinese style will be hosted to welcome foreign leaders and participants. I believe our guests will be immersed in the rich Chinese civilization, feel the dynamism of the country brought by reform and opening up, and have a personal taste of the unique culture of Hangzhou and the hospitality of its people. When they go back home, I'm sure they will have some fond memories to take with them.

The other is about the open and inclusive working style in hosting the summit. It is important for us to pool the wisdom and listen to all parties if we want to make the summit successful. China attaches importance to all sorts of views and respects all sorts of voices. China has been working closely with other G20 members as well as guest countries and international organizations, which deepened mutual understanding and enhanced the ground for cooperation. Six supporting events, i.e. the B20 business forum, the Women 20, the Labor 20, the Civil 20, the Youth 20 and the Think-tank 20, will be held. We hope participation in these events from across the social spectrum will broaden the basis for common ground.

By the time we spoke, a number of G20 outreach dialogues have been held under China's initiative. We visited the UN General Assembly, the AU Headquarters, G77, LDCs, landlocked countries and small island states, and as many people as possible to brief them on the Hangzhou Summit and listen to their views and suggestions. These outreach dialogues have covered almost all UN member states, the over 130 developing countries in particular. And China will continue to listen widely to other parties at such forum like this year's Summer Davos.

Dear Friends,

The Chinese often say that ""the last couple of miles on the journey might be the most difficult"". Preparations leading up to the summit are crucial and require even more hard work. We also believe that ""the fire will run high if all hands add wood to it."" A successful summit won't be possible without the strong support and coordination of other parties. China will continue to work with other parties in an open, inclusive and transparent manner, and will increase communication and coordination with them to ensure a successful summit, one that will deliver win-win outcomes to all G20 members and help move the world economy one step closer to strong, sustainable and balanced growth. We have full confidence that the goal will be met.

With this, the scroll of the Hangzhou Summit is to unfold. I look forward to welcoming you all in September. ",State Councilor and Foreign Minister of the People's Republic of China,Xi Jinping,https://www.fmprc.gov.cn/mfa_eng/wjdt_665385/zyjh_665391/t1368193.shtml,,DEVELOPMENT
USA,01-07-2021 00:00,Joe Biden,Statement by President Joe Biden on the Supreme Court’s Voting Rights Decision in Brnovich v. Democratic National Committee,"I am deeply disappointed in today’s decision by the United States Supreme Court that undercuts the Voting Rights Act, and upholds what Justice Kagan called “a significant race-based disparity in voting opportunities.”

In a span of just eight years, the Court has now done severe damage to two of the most important provisions of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 – a law that took years of struggle and strife to secure. 

After all we have been through to deliver the promise of this Nation to all Americans, we should be fully enforcing voting rights laws, not weakening them. Yet this decision comes just over a week after Senate Republicans blocked even a debate – even consideration – of the For the People Act that would have protected the right to vote from action by Republican legislators in states across the country. 

While this broad assault against voting rights is sadly not unprecedented, it is taking on new forms. It is no longer just about a fight over who gets to vote and making it easier for eligible voters to vote. It is about who gets to count the vote and whether your vote counts at all.

Our democracy depends on an election system built on integrity and independence. The attack we are seeing today makes clearer than ever that additional laws are needed to safeguard that beating heart of our democracy. We must also shore up our election security to address the threats of election subversion from abroad and at home.

Today’s decision also makes it all the more imperative to continue the fight for the For the People Act and the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act to restore and expand voting protections. The Court’s decision, harmful as it is, does not limit Congress’ ability to repair the damage done today: it puts the burden back on Congress to restore the Voting Rights Act to its intended strength.

That means forging a coalition of Americans of every background and political party – from advocates, activists, and business executives – to raise the urgency of the moment and demand that our democracy truly reflects the will of the people and that it delivers for the Nation.

That is what Vice President Harris and I will continue to do. 

This is our life’s work and the work of all of us.

Democracy is on the line.

We can do this together.",President,Joe Biden,https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/07/01/statement-by-president-joe-biden-on-the-supreme-courts-voting-rights-decision-in-brnovich-v-democratic-national-committee/,,OTHERS
Russia,05-08-2018 00:00,Vladimir Putin,The President took part in a State Duma plenary session,"Good afternoon, colleagues,
Yesterday, in accordance with the Constitution, I introduced the candidacy of Dmitry Medvedev for your consideration to be approved for the post of Prime Minister. 
Mr Medvedev certainly needs no special introduction. For the past six years, he has led the country’s Government. You are well aware of how difficult these years have been. Russia and the whole world have faced new challenges and the situation has been changing dynamically. For our country it was particularly acute, and often seemed dramatic.
Despite all these difficulties, the Government has managed to solve not only extraordinary and urgent tasks, but also to identify and preserve the prospects for development and to constantly boost these opportunities aimed at mid- and long-term periods. In my opinion, this is extremely important.
These extensive and comprehensive efforts were built on a solid, professional and fair foundation, without pursuing short-term political outcomes, in a responsible way and, as I said, aiming at the long-term perspective.
The Prime Minister made a detailed report on the Government’s work in the State Duma just recently – in April. I think the main point is that all the achievements of the previous years are creating a solid foundation for moving forward and resolving the historical tasks I spoke about in the Address to the Federal Assembly and at the presidential inauguration ceremony. 
As you know, yesterday I signed Executive Order On the National Goals and Strategic Objectives of the Russian Federation through to 2024. This document talks about an active demographic policy and a steady growth of the population, a breakthrough in technology and science, high economic growth rates, new living standards for our citizens, an increase in their real incomes, and a drastic reduction of poverty. 
It is necessary to build an effective social support system, continue reforms in education and healthcare, resolve the housing and environmental problems and support culture. Finally, it is essential to launch major infrastructure, transport and energy projects, develop the Russian Far East, the Arctic and all of our regions, and upgrade cities and rural communities. 
The implementation of national projects and programmes will require joint, well-orchestrated efforts at all levels and branches of government – both legislative and executive, and all regions. I am also hoping for active participation of public and professional associations and the Russian business community.
Let me repeat that these goals are very broad and ambitious and to reach them the consolidation of the entire society is required and everyone’s contribution is important. You represent different parliamentary parties and different political forces but above all you represent our citizens, your voters. I am sure that their interests, needs, and aspirations and, hence, Russia’s interests and wellbeing are playing the most important role for you and for all of us. I count on your readiness to take part in our team creative endeavour. All constructive ideas and proposals will be taken into account in the interests of our common cause. 
The previous Government was distinguished by its democratic nature, openness for dialogue and discussion, readiness to review constructive proposals and accept justified criticism. These qualities became its brand name, its professional style. Much credit for the establishment of this modern managerial environment certainly goes to Mr Medvedev. 
I know that he held consultations with all the parliamentary parties yesterday and today, and I am sure he will continue to closely cooperate with the parliament in the future. I believe it is very important to provide continuity and new trajectory to the Government’s work. Today all of this is essential.
I will repeat what I said yesterday: we have no time to lose; we must act. In this sense, I believe it is of utmost importance to note that over the past year, or maybe a year and a half, Dmitry Medvedev and several members of the Executive Office and the Government have been working on the programme I set out in the Executive Order signed yesterday.
This is the programme we will have to implement together. Dmitry Medvedev with his staff and the Executive Office took part in developing this programme. I think it is logical for the same team to implement these plans.
Let me repeat, the Government will have the key and core role here. It must be strong, responsible and ready to make progressive and decisive steps. It must be formed as fast as possible and must include a professional core that can join the work started earlier effectively and proactively.
But first of all, we must approve the Prime Minister. I address all of you, all the deputies and representatives of all parliamentary parties; although Dmitry Medvedev represents the leading fraction in parliament, I address all the parliamentary parties. I ask you to support my proposal to appoint Dmitry Medvedev the Prime Minister of the Russian Federation.
Thank you for your attention.

Russia,06-09-2011 00:00,Dmitry Medvedev,State Council Presidium meeting on environmental safety,"Good afternoon,

Today our agenda focuses on environmental issues. These matters are difficult in our country, as they are in many other countries: we are not unique in this. But Russia’s environmental problems are exacerbated by its vast territory and a whole range of industries that were built in the past and never modernised, and which cause damage to the environment.

We have discussed these issues on numerous occasions, including at the State Council Presidium meeting held in May last year. Following that meeting, I issued instruction No. 1640, which was aimed at improving state regulation in the environment sphere. I looked into this matter yesterday, during my meeting with heads of environmental NGOs, examined the data, and I realised that the state regulation is virtually derailed because most of the regulatory material which was to be drafted has not been prepared. I believe it is the Government’s responsibility for not bringing a series of documents to their conclusion so that as a result they were not submitted to the State Duma, as well as some organisations that were in charge of drafting these documents. Today I want you to tell me exactly when this work will be finished. I spoke with Mr Trutnev [Minister of Natural Resources and Environmental Protection] yesterday, and after that issued instructions to the Presidential Executive Office, and part of the documents are presently in the State Duma. There is every opportunity to accelerate this effort.

    ”Reversing the accumulated ecological damage is a vast and complex task that requires significant investment, not only from the state but also private enterprises, as well as the introduction of new technologies for processing and safe disposal of waste.“

As you know, there are numerous environmental problems, both new and older ones that we have inherited from the past. To be perfectly frank, the inherited problems far outnumber the new ones. The location of this meeting is a landmark in this sense: Dzerzhinsk is a city that has always been known for its chemical industry. I saw as I flew over it by helicopter the impressive scope of production that was set up in Soviet times, but the extent of neglect and, in fact, the ecological disaster connected with it is equally striking.

To date, the country has accumulated more than 30 billion tons of hazardous waste. Most of that represent industrial by-products. Reversing the accumulated ecological damage is a vast and complex task that requires significant investment, not only from the state but also private enterprises, as well as the introduction of new technologies for processing and safe disposal of waste. We must have a legal framework in place for control mechanisms and state involvement, as I said earlier.

Today we will discuss specific mechanisms and relevant draft laws that either have been drafted already or will be ready very soon. On the whole, there are draft laws for us to work with, for example, we have looked at ways to reclaim one of the environmentally hazardous sites here in Dzerzhinsk. All this is done in other countries, and successfully so. But it is essential to allocate sufficient funds and encourage all those who are responsible for this area. There must be incentives not only for government agencies that oversee these activities but, most importantly, for businesses, which must realise that it is not such an enormous burden and in some cases may even be beneficial.

    ”Protecting ecology and the environment is not just a challenge for us, it is not only our national task as no state can address it in isolation, so we must work more closely with our neighbours. We have a great deal to learn from them.“

With regard to ecological security measures, special attention should be paid to the fuel and energy complex, because it is a major sector that often creates the worst problems. Everyone remembers the oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico. This disaster forces us to take great care when implementing projects of this kind and to develop a comprehensive approach to ensuring their safety.

We have submitted our proposals to our international partners and they are now being considered. Exploration and development of oil and gas deposits on the continental shelf, the construction of offshore platforms, oil terminals and tanker fleet inevitably entail a significant increase in the anthropogenic burden on the unique natural resources in the Arctic and the Far East, and we have no right to forget about it.

Protecting ecology and the environment is not just a challenge for us, it is not only our national task as no state can address it in isolation, so we must work more closely with our neighbours. We have a great deal to learn from them because they started focusing on environmental investments much earlier and became involved in the so-called green growth. They are more prepared for this and we must find viable ways to cooperate with our closest neighbours in this sector. There are also those among them who create problems for us, and we must work with them to agree on how to minimise such damage. Regular training is also vitally important, for example, on preventing oil spills, and we must perfect joint action mechanisms for emergency situations.

I’ll say a few words about the prospects of nuclear power; I spoke a lot about it last time, too. After the tragic events at the Fukushima 1 NPP, this has become a burning issue, and as you know, several states have made extremely tough decisions. In Germany, some people are flat-out calling for a Constitutional amendment banning the use of nuclear energy. I see this approach as an extreme one, because it is unlikely humanity will be able to live without nuclear energy in the foreseeable future. However, it’s true that making safety regulations more stringent should be a priority for the entire global community.

We have made significant progress in this regard following the Chernobyl accident. We have created a fairly strict system for safety monitoring and are actively using it in Russia as well as other nations that use our nuclear technologies. I also brought this topic up during the G8 summit in Deauville.

    ”We must not only improve our national regulatory framework, but also create new international conventions. These suggestions will be made by the Russian Federation within the framework of the IAEA and other forums that will look into these issues.“

We must not only improve our national regulatory framework, but also create new international conventions. These suggestions will be made by the Russian Federation within the framework of the IAEA and other forums that will look into these issues. Many conventions certainly need to be revised. As I already said, we have found ourselves better prepared in this regard – our reactors have been made safer since the Chernobyl disaster – so we are ready to share our experience with other states.

Another factor that creates significant pressure on the environment is transport infrastructure. Residents of large cities feel many problems in this regard. In the last ten years or so, since life has become somewhat more comfortable, car ownership rates have been increasing five times faster than the rates of road network development. And naturally, in addition to creating chronic traffic jams, causing problems for an enormous number of people and reducing transport speeds, which we could live with, this also pollutes the air. This, too, is a topic requiring our consolidated attention and actions within the framework of the decisions made concerning the regions.

And there is one last, but no less important matter that I want to address today. Whatever laws we may pass, they will not be effective if they clash with our careless attitudes toward the environment. Yesterday, I spoke about this with ecologists, and naturally, they fully agree. Quite honestly, this issue is not a priority for just about anyone in our nation. We all know this. It is, if you will, a remnant of previous approaches. People feel they will only begin to work on these matters when all other problems in our nation are resolved.

Everyone present here – ministers, governors, and especially business representatives – have spoken many times with their foreign partners. Nobody really likes to pay for the environment, but it’s on their agendas, whereas here, only the most mature entrepreneurs are concerned with it today.

    ”Our reactors have been made safer since the Chernobyl disaster – so we are ready to share our experience with other states.“

Yesterday, I was defending our entrepreneurs at a meeting with ecologists, saying that they have become much more mature in the last decade, particularly in light of the growth in personal income and opportunities, and they understand it is impossible not to invest in preserving the environment and use modern technologies, especially since these usually increase labour efficiency and create better productivity. Nevertheless, we need a consolidated understanding of our common responsibility in this area. The environment must become fashionable and prestigious not just for ecologists and schoolchildren who gather trash in the woods, but also for civil servants, businesspeople, and creative professionals.

How do we achieve this? We can only do it by way of a so-called environmental education – an education involving the study of Russia’s nature, but not in formal terms, as it was done before. Instead, we need to develop a taste for environmental culture from an early age, developing caring attitudes toward the environment. I also discussed this matter yesterday with the ecologists, and they were very critical of the Government and the Education Ministry, which they felt did not accept a whole set of documents. Today, I specifically verified. It turned out that certain decisions were reached, and new regulations have been included in the teaching standards, which should be passed very soon. But I have no doubt that this is the very last thing that was dealt with. This was after talking about the National Final School Exam, after talking about the classes we should have, how many hours should be devoted to mathematics and the Russian language. Of course, people barely remember ecology – again, in part because we simply do not have a common culture of talking about it. And naturally, we have a great deal of wealth. All the territories represented at this table are enormous, the equivalent of entire European nations, or even several European states. And like it or not, this also affects the way we think. It is precisely this kind of thinking that we must change.

Weekly Address: Congress Should Do its Job and Pass a Serious Budget"," Hi, everybody.  Yesterday, we learned that our businesses created another 118,000 new jobs in September.  That makes 67 straight months of job creation, and 13.2 million new jobs in all. 

But we would be doing even better if we didn’t have to keep dealing with crises in Congress every few months.  And especially at a time when the global economy is softening, our own growth could slow if Congress doesn’t do away with harmful austerity measures.

Now, on Wednesday, more than half of Republicans in Congress voted to shut down the government for the second time in two years.  Fortunately, there were enough votes in both parties to pass a last-minute bill to keep the government open for another ten weeks.  Unfortunately, that gimmick only sets up another shutdown threat two weeks before Christmas.

Look, that’s not the way America should operate.  It just kicks the can down the road without solving any problems or doing any long-term planning for the future.  And that’s why I will not sign another shortsighted, short-term spending bill like the one Congress sent me this week. 

Here’s why.  A few years ago, both parties agreed to put in place harmful, automatic cuts that make no distinction between spending we don’t need and spending we do.  Those cuts have actually kept our economy from growing faster.  Even worse, they’re actually undermining the middle class. 

Here’s one example.  If we don’t undo these mindless cuts, then next year, we’ll be funding our kids’ education at the same levels per pupil we did in the year 2000.  Compared to my budget, that would be like cutting federal funding for 4,500 schools, 17,500 teachers and aides, 1.9 million students. 

That’s not good for our kids or our economy.  It’s a prescription for American decline.  And it shouldn’t happen.  We should invest in things like education today, or we’ll pay the price tomorrow.

Congress should do its job, stop kicking the can down the road, and pass a serious budget rather than flirt with another shutdown.  A serious budget is one that keeps America strong through our military, our law enforcement; that keeps America generous through caring for our veterans and our seniors; that keeps America competitive by educating our kids and our workers.

That’s what I want to work with serious people in both parties to achieve.  Because that’s how we’ll build on the progress of 13 million new jobs, and help the middle class get ahead.

Thanks everybody, and have a great weekend.",President,Barack Obama,https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/the-press-office/2015/10/03/weekly-address-congress-should-do-its-job-and-pass-serious-budget,,DEVELOPMENT

Remarks by the President on the Terrorist Attack in Paris","I've reached out to President Hollande of France and hope to have the opportunity to talk to him today.  But I thought it was appropriate for me to express my deepest sympathies to the people of Paris and the people of France for the terrible terrorist attack that took place earlier today.

I think that all of us recognize that France is one of our oldest allies, our strongest allies.  They have been with us at every moment when we've -- from 9/11 on, in dealing with some of the terrorist organizations around the world that threaten us.  For us to see the kind of cowardly evil attacks that took place today I think reinforces once again why it's so important for us to stand in solidarity with them, just as they stand in solidarity with us.

The fact that this was an attack on journalists, attack on our free press, also underscores the degree to which these terrorists fear freedom -- of speech and freedom of the press.  But the one thing that I'm very confident about is that the values that we share with the French people, a belief -- a universal belief in the freedom of expression, is something that can't be silenced because of the senseless violence of the few.

And so our counterterrorism cooperation with France is excellent.  We will provide them with every bit of assistance that we can going forward.  I think it's going to be important for us to make sure that we recognize these kinds of attacks can happen anywhere in the world.  And one of the things I'll be discussing with Secretary Kerry today is to make sure that we remain vigilant not just with respect to Americans living in Paris, but Americans living in Europe and in the Middle East and other parts of the world, and making sure that we stay vigilant in trying to protect them -- and to hunt down and bring the perpetrators of this specific act to justice, and to roll up the networks that help to advance these kinds of plots.

In the end, though, the most important thing I want to say is that our thoughts and prayers are with the families of those who’ve been lost in France, and with the people of Paris and the people of France.  What that beautiful city represents -- the culture and the civilization that is so central to our imaginations -- that's going to endure.  And those who carry out senseless attacks against innocent civilians, ultimately they’ll be forgotten.  And we will stand with the people of France through this very, very difficult time.

Thank you very much, everybody.",President,Barack Obama,https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/the-press-office/2015/01/07/remarks-president-terrorist-attack-paris,,EXTREMISM
Russia,03-10-2009 00:00,Dmitry Medvedev,Speech at a Meeting of the Anti-Corruption Council,"Good afternoon!

This is the second meeting of the Anti-Corruption Council. It is dedicated to the implementation of the anti-corruption strategy that we discussed and which has been approved. Of course now we can discuss some of the results already achieved. They have thus far been modest in the extreme but we must nevertheless keep moving ahead. Our work is worthwhile in the sense that little by little, within the realm of the possible, we keep trying to improve things and refuse to throw up our hands.

Let me remind you that at the last Council meeting we approved a package of anti-corruption laws. They have already been adopted and have entered into force. The federal and regional authorities have approved relevant plans of action, a system for monitoring these activities has started to function, and the legal framework created by our labours has already begun to show signs of life.

Of course it is important to keep up the pace and to monitor the application of these laws. This is the most important thing but it is also the most difficult, because in effect applying these laws involves us in the very fight against the corruption that we are trying to deal with.

Of course it is very important to adopt subordinate legislation that would ensure the realisation of the package of anti-corruption laws. I am talking about innovative technologies for public administrators; rules that ensure administrative transparency; issues involved in the transition to electronic trading and to the latest technologies for the disposal of assets subject to forfeiture and other types of property that in effect have to be sold by the state; the creation of a state legal aid office and Internet sites — in short, all those issues that we have agreed are important.

At this meeting, I suggest that we confine ourselves to the problems that require prompt action. First, there is the system of anti-corruption expert assessments concerning laws our country has adopted as well as of course subordinate legislation. These will act in effect as a kind of filter for the municipal, regional and federal authorities.

We have repeatedly discussed the question of different views and different interpretations and the gaps in the regulatory structures that increase the risk of corrupt practices, which is why we must pay such careful attention to these expert assessments. They should be completely free of bias and conducted in an ongoing, systematic manner. The Cabinet has already approved the rules relevant to the expert assessments of the regulatory framework. This will also help identify the factors in the subordinate legislation that contribute to corruption.

This is only part of the work and today we should discuss the draft federal law on anti-corruption expert assessment of legislative initiatives. This is because as a rule legislative initiatives can embody the best aspirations of lobbying, but in the worst case scenario they can be the means by which corruption flourishes. Therefore, the bill can make an important contribution to this process, but only if it is a valid bill, only if it is sufficiently clear and effective, and not merely a collection of pious hopes.

The second issue that we will be looking at is the procedures involving state and municipal officials as well as those individuals who hold public office positions, the rules that require them to give information about their personal assets and the incomes of their family members. Let me draw your attention to the need to not only adopt procedures for submitting such information, but also to develop a mechanism to verify the accuracy and completeness of the information involved in such financial disclosures. We currently have no such mechanism. The subject is complex and somewhat sensitive but we need to move in this direction.

In addition we need to introduce rules governing the employment of those who used to take up public office, as well as state and municipal employees after their official retirement. And this applies not only to civil servants but also to the military, and those who work for law enforcement agencies. You will recall the rules that are part of the anti-corruption package, the ones that allow employment only with the consent of the commission on strictures concerning the conduct of public officers and the resolution of conflicts of interest. But this general requirement does not yet exist as a genuine, functioning mechanism — we have to create it.

As you can see, we are talking about a whole system of pre-emptive measures, as indicated by the relevant United Nations Convention and the European Union Convention on the Fight against Corruption. For this purpose, we have also developed a package of draft decrees. These decrees will determine the range of persons who are required to submit the above information.

I think that rules concerning this kind of information should apply to everyone, including the President of the Russian Federation: the President should be obliged to comply, in the same way that all the other citizens who are in government service and occupy official positions do, and do so on an annual basis. There are no regulations on this subject – we have to introduce them. I will be preparing such regulations.

I think that this sort of annual disclosure on the part of the President will at least to some extent encourage individuals who take up public office as well as federal government officials to comply with the appropriate legislation.

We should pay very careful attention to the work of commissions on strictures concerning the conduct of public officers and the resolution of conflicts of interest. As we agreed and as the law requires, such a commission must be established for each government agency, and this will involve some organisational work in creating these commissions, training those who have to carry out this work, and supplying them with all the necessary materials and documents. This is a separate issue that we will have to deal with.

This sort of commission was in principle part of previous legislation on public service, but it has to be admitted that they never played any significant role. Our responsibility is to make sure that these commissions get up and running, that they are listened to, and that they receive the information they require. Refusing to cooperate with a commission or ignoring the requirements of the law must be unconditional grounds for dismissal from government service.

In addition, the Presidential Executive Office has prepared a draft decree on the approval of a five-year Federal Programme for the Reform and Development of Civil Service in the Russian Federation. I will be signing that decree today. This is part of a large project that began not today but several years ago (when I was part of the Presidential Executive Office I was involved in it). I cannot say that we have made fantastic progress. The only thing that we have been able to do in recent years is to create a more or less transparent and accountable modern system of legislation on public service. It is not ideal, but at least it is very different from what we had in the early 90s. In that sense this Federal Programme for the Development of the Civil Service should contribute to this process.

Of course the reform of the civil service should be first and foremost designed to prevent corruption. For this reason the requirements of anti-corruption legislation have to be taken into account when selecting candidates for vacant positions. As I have already said, the crisis that we are currently in presents us with a good opportunity to deal with inefficient public servants. The control of corruption is especially important.

Even though we have to turn a blind eye to some things in times of crisis, of course the issue of corruption is the most difficult and thus, perhaps, the most sensitive issue that we face, because at a time when the country is going through some very serious economic problems, those who trying to take advantage of this situation should of course be expelled from government service. We have to get rid of such public servants without delay.

Dear colleagues, we must carry out this difficult task and continue to develop our regulatory framework. It is good that what we have already achieved has a regulatory aspect: the Anti-Corruption Council is working, and there is the Council's Presidium. Of course the issue is not to over-organize things, not to make it all bureaucratic, not to turn this work into a bunch of memos of the sort that we know all too well and which we come across all too often in the public service.

Nevertheless, in this systematic treatment I can see evidence of a general will to combat the phenomenon of corruption. We must not ignore this subject no matter what, no matter what crises we have, what political issues come up, what business environment develops, or what other issues we have to confront. This subject must receive our sustained attention, because this problem is a profound and important one.",President,Dmitry Medvedev,http://en.kremlin.ru/events/president/transcripts/statements/3387,,OTHERS
United Kingdom,17-Oct-16,Theresa May,PM's address at Team GB & Paralympics GB athletes reception: 17 October 2016,"Thank you very much, Richard. Can I, on behalf of the whole country, congratulate you all – TeamGB and Paralympics GB – on one of the greatest sporting achievements in our history. Well done to all of you. After London 2012, many wondered whether that medal haul could ever be repeated. But you didn’t just repeat it, you beat it. And you made Britain the first ever nation to improve its performance at the Olympics and Paralympics following a home Games. So well done. From the first men’s swimming Gold Medal for 28 years to the first ever British Gold medals in diving, gymnastics and – yes – women’s hockey, you won Gold Medals in more sports than any other nation. And with an incredible 30 more Paralympic Golds than London 2012, you set a staggering 49 new Paralympic Records and 27 new World Records. And I have to say, time after time the nation came to a halt as you wrote your names into the history books. Armies of armchair fans were out there – they stayed up late to follow your progress every night – watching in awe and filled with pride. And I think it is absolutely right that we should take this moment as a nation to say an enormous and heartfelt thank you to you all. And it is right too that we should gather here in Manchester, where so many medals were made. We don’t always get to see the dedication and effort put in behind the scenes. But I think we can all now understand those cold, dark mornings, those intense training sessions, the years of sacrifice and the unwavering commitment to your passion and your profession and it is an inspiration to us all. So, too, is the example set by those who have helped you on the way. The incredible support staff – and the love and strength of your friends and families – so many of whom have shared in the sacrifices and so in the highs and lows of your journey. So today’s celebration is also a thank you to them – so they know that every peak and trough has been worth it to get to that moment where you put on the GB jersey and do your country proud on the biggest stage of all. But as we gather here today to reflect on another glorious Olympic summer, so we should also look forward with a real sense of optimism. This summer you didn’t just make history, you helped to shape our future too. Today in school playgrounds, parks and sports centres across the country, children are dreaming of emulating your success. There are boys who want to be the next Mo Farah or the next Brownlee brothers. Girls who want to be the next Laura Kenny or the next Dame Sarah Storey. Children of every faith and background inspired by the lessons you have taught us – about hard work, dignity, true sportsmanship and above all what it means to be part of a team. And because of the incredible performance from our Paralympians, there are thousands more people now thinking differently about disability; thousands of people whose first thought about a disabled person is no longer what they can’t do but rather – rightly – what they can do. So you are changing perceptions and helping to create a better Britain and a better world. As we gather to celebrate today, I know that many of you are already back in training and looking forward to Tokyo. Last year the government announced a 29% increase in funding for elite sport. It was a bold statement about our determination to invest in your success. And that financial commitment will continue under this new government. In 4 years’ time, I want to see another great parade like today’s – after another great summer of success in Tokyo 2020. This has been, as we saw out there on the stage, a homecoming for heroes, because that is what you are. Thank you for bringing our country together in a wonderful sense of pride. Thank you for inspiring generations to follow in your footsteps. And thank you for making Britain one of the world’s great Olympic and Paralympic Superpowers.

USA,21-11-2017 00:00,Donald Trump,Remarks by President Trump at the National Thanksgiving Turkey Pardoning Ceremony,"THE PRESIDENT: Well, thank you all for being here, and welcome to the White House. A very special place. On behalf of Melania, Barron, and the entire Trump family, I want to wish you and all Americans a very happy and blessed Thanksgiving. And I hear that beautiful turkey. (Laughter.)

We are here today to continue a wonderful American tradition. Today, in the spirit of Thanksgiving, I will grant a presidential pardon to a turkey. (Laughter.)

I’m especially pleased that we’re joined for this great occasion by Carl Wittenburg, Chairman of the National Turkey Federation, along with his wife, Sharlene, and sons, Nate and Wyatt.

It was 70 years ago that the National Turkey Federation first presented the National Thanksgiving Turkey to President Harry Truman — who, I might add, did not grant the pardon. He refused. He was a tough cookie. (Laughter.) Today, I’m going to be a much nicer President.

Over the past 10 months, Melania and I have had the pleasure of welcoming many, many special visitors to the great White House. We’ve hosted dozens of incredible world leaders, members of Congress, and, along the way, a few very strange birds. But we have yet to receive any visitors quite like our magnificent guest of honor today — Drumstick. Hi, Drumstick. Oh, Drumstick, I think, is going to be very happy.

I’m pleased to report that, unlike millions of other turkeys at this time of the year, Drumstick has a very, very bright future ahead of him. Drumstick was raised on Carl and Sharlene’s turkey farm in Douglas County, Minnesota, with the help of five young women from the Douglas County 4-H chapter who are here with us today. And I want to say, great work. Where are they? Please stand. Great job you’ve done. (Applause.) 4-H. That’s great. Thank you.

Upon being pardoned, Drumstick and his friend, Wishbone, will live out their days at “Gobbler’s Rest” — beautiful place. It’s custom-built; it’s an enclosure on the campus of Virginia Tech. Tremendous school. There, they’ll join Tater and Tot, the two turkeys pardoned last year by President Obama.

As many of you know, I have been very active in overturning a number of executive actions by my predecessor. However, I have been informed by the White House Counsel’s Office that Tater and Tot’s pardons cannot, under any circumstances, be revoked. So we’re not going to revoke them. So, Tater and Tot, you can rest easy.

I’d also like to thank the National Turkey Federation for bringing along two other turkeys from Jaindl’s Turkey Farm in Orefield, Pennsylvania — the great state of Pennsylvania. We’re donating these turkeys to Martha’s Table, a truly fantastic charity right here in Washington D.C., which provides warm meals to people in need. They do a fantastic job.

Before we get to the pardon, I would like to take a moment to extend our very heartfelt special message: Thanks. Thanks, folks — to the finest and bravest people in the entire world, our great men and women in uniform: the military, law enforcement, first responders. These are incredible people. So, thank you.

Many of you are always — and you know your loved ones — and you’re far away, and you spend so much time away. This Thanksgiving, I want each of you to know that we’re forever grateful for the incredible job and for the incredible sacrifices that you and your families make in defense of our nation, our freedom, and our truly great American flag.

I’d also like to express my thanks to the wonderful citizens of our country — the people who care for our communities, raise America’s children, uphold our laws and our values, and make this amazing land into our national home.

As we gather together with our families on Thanksgiving and give thanks for our many blessings, we are reminded of the national family to which we all belong as citizens of this incredible country.

This Thursday, as we give thanks for our cherished loved ones, let us also renew our bonds of trust, loyalty, and affection between our fellow citizens as members of a proud national family of Americans.

And now I think Drumstick and Wishbone would be very thankful if we would just get around to the pardon. They say,
“Enough talk, please pardon us.”

So I want to thank everybody for being here today and wish everybody a very, very happy Thanksgiving — very special people a very special country.

Thank you very much. Thank you. (Applause.)",President,Donald Trump,https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefings-statements/remarks-president-trump-national-thanksgiving-turkey-pardoning-ceremony/,,OTHERS

Remarks by the President on Sustainable Development Goals","Good afternoon.  Mr. Secretary General, fellow delegates, ladies and gentlemen.  It is a great honor to be here to address the topic of sustainable development.

In many of our nations, especially developed countries, there is among our general population a genuine compassion towards those in need.  There is a recognition of the grinding poverty that so many experience every day around the world.  And yet sometimes it's said that our efforts to combat poverty and disease do not and cannot work, that there are some places beyond hope, that certain people and regions are condemned to an endless cycle of suffering.  Here, today, we put those myths to rest.  Today, we set aside the skepticism, and we lift up the hope that is available to us through collective action.  

Because the world came together in an unprecedented effort, the global hunger rate has already been slashed.  Tens of millions of more boys and girls are today in school.  Prevention and treatment of measles and malaria and tuberculosis have saved nearly 60 million lives.  HIV/AIDS infections and deaths have plummeted.  And more than one billion people have lifted themselves up from extreme poverty -- one billion.  

The entire world can take enormous pride in these historic achievements.  And so let the skeptics and cynics know development works.  Investing in public health works.  We can break the cycle of poverty.  People and nations can rise into prosperity.  Despite the cruelties of our world and the ravages of disease, millions of lives can be saved if we are focused, and if we work together.  Cynicism is our enemy.  A belief, a capacity in the dignity of every individual, and a recognition that we, each of us, can play a small part to play in lifting up people all around the world -- that is the message that we are sending here today.  And because of the work of so many who are assembled here today, we can point to past success.  And yet, we are also here today because we understand that our work is nowhere near done.  We can take pride in what we've accomplished, but we cannot be complacent.  

When eleven boys and girls die every single minute from preventable causes, we know we have more work to do.  When hundreds of women die every single day just from having a baby, we know we have more work to do.  When tens of millions of children are still not in school, when hundreds of millions of people have no clean water, no toilets, we have so much more to do.  

Right now, some 800 million men, women and children are scraping by on less than $1.25 a day.  Imagine that.  Gripped by the ache of an empty stomach.  Billions of our fellow human beings are at risk of dying from diseases that we know how to prevent.  Many children are just one mosquito bite away from death.  And that is a moral outrage.  It is a profound injustice. It is literally a matter of life and death, and now the world must act.  We cannot leave people behind.

And so, today, we commit ourselves to new Sustainable Development Goals, including our goal of ending extreme poverty in our world.  We do so understanding how difficult the task may be.  We suffer no illusions of the challenges ahead.  But we understand this is something that we must commit ourselves to.  Because in doing so, we recognize that our most basic bond -- our common humanity -- compels us to act.  An impoverished child in a distant slum or a neighborhood not that far from here is just as equal, just as worthy, as any of our children, as any of us, as any head of government or leader in this great hall. 

We reaffirm that supporting development is not charity, but is instead one of the smartest investments we can make in our own future.  After all, it is a lack of development -- when people have no education, and no jobs, and no hope, a feeling that their basic human dignity is being violated -- that helps fuel so much of the tensions and conflict and instability in our world.  

And I profoundly believe that many of the conflicts, the refugee crises, the military interventions over the years might have been avoided if nations had truly invested in the lives of their people, and if the wealthiest nations on Earth were better partners in working with those that are trying to lift themselves up.  (Applause.)    

As one of the founders of the United Nations, Ralph Bunche once said, “Peace is no mere matter of men fighting or not fighting.  Peace, to have meaning…must be translated into bread or rice, shelter, health, and education.”  

I’m here to say that in this work, the United States will continue to be your partner.  Five years ago, I pledged here that America would remain the global leader in development, and the United States government, in fact, remains the single largest donor of development assistance, including in global health.  In times of crisis -- from Ebola to Syria -- we are the largest provider of humanitarian aid.  In times of disaster and crisis, the world can count on the friendship and generosity of the American people.  

The question before us, though, as an international community, is how do we meet these new goals that we’ve set today?  How can we do our work better?  How can we stretch our resources and our funding more effectively?  How can donor countries be smarter, and how can recipient countries do more with what they receive?  We have to learn from the past -- to see where we succeeded so that we can duplicate that success, and to understand where we’ve fallen short and correct those shortcomings.  

And we start by understanding that this next chapter of development cannot fall victim to the old divides between developed nations and developing ones.  Poverty, growing inequality exists in all of our nations, and all of our nations have work to do.  And that includes here in the United States.  

That’s why, after a terrible recession, my administration has worked to keep millions of families from falling into poverty.  That's why we’ve brought quality, affordable health care to more than 17 million Americans.  Here in this country, the wealthiest nation on Earth, we’re still working every day to perfect our union, and to be more equal and more just, and to treat the most vulnerable members of our society with value and concern.  

That’s why, today, I am committing the United States to achieving the Sustainable Development Goals.  (Applause.)  And as long as I am President, and well after I'm done being President, I will keep fighting for the education and housing and health care and jobs that reduce inequality and create opportunity here in the United States and around the world.  (Applause.)  Because this is not just the job of politicians; this is work for all of us.     

This next chapter of development cannot just be about what governments spend, it has to harness the unprecedented resources of our interconnected world.  In just a few short years -- in the areas of health, and food security, and energy -- my administration has committed and helped mobilize more than $100 billion to promote development and save lives.  More than $100 billion.  And guided by the new consensus we reached in Addis, I'm calling on others to join us.  More governments, more institutions, more businesses, more philanthropies, more NGOs, more faith communities, more citizens -- we all need to step up with the will and the resources and the coordination to achieve our goals.  This must be the work of the world.

At the same time, this next chapter of development must focus not simply on the dollars we spend, but on the results that we achieve.  And this demands new technologies and approaches, accountability, data, behavioral science -- understanding that there’s lessons that we have learned, best practices on how people actually live so that we can dramatically improve outcomes.  It means breaking cycles of dependence by helping people become more self-sufficient -- not just giving people fish, but teaching them how to fish.  That's the purpose of development.  

Rather than just sending food during famine -- although we have to do that to avert starvation -- we also have to bring new techniques and new seeds and new technologies to more farmers so they can boost their yields and increase their incomes, feed more people and lift countless millions out of poverty.  Rather than just respond to outbreaks like Ebola -- although we have to do that, and we have -- let’s also strengthen public health systems and advance global health security to prevent epidemics in the first place.  

As more countries take ownership of their HIV/AIDS programs, the United States is setting two new bold goals.  Over the next two years, we’ll increase the number of people that our funding reaches -- so that nearly 13 million people with HIV/AIDS get lifesaving treatment -- and we’ll invest $300 million to help achieve a 40 percent reduction in new HIV infections among young women and girls in the hardest-hit areas of sub-Saharan Africa.  (Applause.)  And I believe we can do that -- the first AIDS-free generation.  (Applause.)       

This next chapter of development must also unleash economic growth -- not just for a few at the top, but inclusive, sustainable growth that lifts up the fortunes of the many.  We know the ingredients for creating jobs and opportunity -- they are not a secret.  So let’s embrace reforms that attract trade and investment to areas that are in need of investment and in need of trade.  Let’s trade and build more together, make it easier for developing countries to sell more of their goods around the world.  And let’s invest in our greatest resource -- our people -- their education, their skills.  Let’s invest in innovative entrepreneurs, the striving young people who embrace new technology and are starting businesses and can ignite new industries that change the world.  I have met young people on every continent, and they can lead the way if we give them the tools they need.

Our new development goals are ambitious.  But thanks to the good work of many of you, they are achievable -- if we work together; if we meet our responsibilities to each other.  I believe that.  The progress of recent years gives us hope.  We know what works.  We know how to do this.  But perhaps because this is now my seventh year of addressing the General Assembly, I tend to be more blunt.  Along with the gray hair, I'm becoming more likely to speak my mind.  (Laughter.)  So indulge me when I say that we will never achieve our goals if we do not squarely confront several insidious threats to the dignity and well-being of people around the world.  No matter how much hard work is done by development agencies, no matter how large the donations and commitments that are made by donor countries, if we don't take care of some other elements of development, we will not meet the goals that we've set.  

Number one, development is threatened by bad governance.  Today, we affirm what we know to be true from decades of experience -- development and economic growth that is truly sustainable and inclusive depends on governments and institutions that care about their people, that are accountable, that respect human rights and deliver justice for everybody and not just some. 

So, in the face of corruption that siphons billions away from schools and hospitals and infrastructure into foreign bank accounts, governments have to embrace transparency and open government and rule of law.  And combating illicit finance must be a global effort because it is part of our development effort. And citizens and civil society groups must be free to organize and speak their mind and work for progress, because that's how countries develop; that's how countries succeed.  

Development is also threatened by inequality.  And this is a political debate that we have in this country, so I just want to be clear, this is not something from which the United States is immune to.  Every country has to grapple with this issue.  The wealthiest and most powerful in our societies oftentimes like to keep things as they are, and they often have disproportionate political influences.  When poor children are more likely to get sick and die than children in wealthier neighborhoods just across town; when rural families are more likely to go without clean water; when ethnic and religious minorities, or people with disabilities, or people of different sexual orientations are discriminated against or can’t access education and opportunity  -- that holds all of us back.  And so, in all of our countries, we have to invest in the interventions that allow us to reach more people -- because no one should be left behind just because of where they live or what they look like.   

Development is threatened by old attitudes, especially those that deny rights and opportunity to women.  In too many places, girls are less likely to be in school than boys.  Globally, women are less likely to have a job than men and are more likely to live in poverty.  I've said this before and I will keep repeating it -- one of the best indicators of whether a country will succeed is how it treats its women.  (Applause.)  When women have an education, when women have a job, their children are more likely to get an education, their families are healthier and more prosperous.  Their communities and countries do better, as well. So every nation -- all of our nations -- must invest in the education and health and skills of our women and girls.

And I have to say I do not have patience for the excuse of, well, we have our own ways of doing things.  (Applause.)  We understand that there is a long tradition in every society of discriminating against women.  But that's not an excuse for taking a new path in order to make sure that everyone in a society has opportunity.  

Development is threatened if we do not recognize the incredible dynamism and opportunity of today’s Africa.  Hundreds of millions of Africans still struggle in the face of grinding poverty and deadly diseases, daily assaults on their lives and dignity.  But I visited Africa recently, and what I saw gave me hope and I know should give you hope, because that continent has made impressive gains in health and education.  It is one of the fastest-growing regions of the world, with a rising middle class. 

And during my travels, Africans -- especially young Africans -- tell me they don’t just want aid, they want trade.  They want businesses.  They want investment.  So I call on the world to join us as we mobilize billions of dollars in new trade and investment and development in Africa -- and that includes Power Africa, our initiative to bring electricity and greater opportunity to more than 60 million African homes and businesses. If we get Africa fulfilling its full potential, that will help the entire global economy.  Everyone here will be helped.  It's not a zero-sum game.  We are invested in their success.  (Applause.)  

Development is threatened by war.  This should be a simple proposition, but it bears repeating.  It is no coincidence that half of the people living in extreme poverty around the world live in places afflicted by chronic violence and conflict.  Today, some 60 million men, women and children have been forced from their homes, many by conflicts in the Middle East and in Africa.  These are humanitarian crises and refugees that we cannot ignore, and we have to deliver the urgent aid that is needed right now.  And those countries that can must do more to accommodate refugees, recognizing that those children are just like ours.  But our efforts must be matched by the hard work of diplomacy and reconciliation to end conflicts that so often tear societies apart.

And as I said earlier, war and conflict is more likely to arise where we have bad governance, and we have high inequality, and we have discrimination against minority groups and ethnic groups, and we have low educational levels.  So these things are all related.         

And finally, development is threatened by climate change.  And I want to thank the Secretary General for the extraordinary leadership and work that he’s done on this issue.  (Applause.)  

All of our countries will be affected by a changing climate. But the world’s poorest people will bear the heaviest burden -- from rising seas and more intense droughts, shortages of water and food.  We will be seeing climate change refugees.  As His Holiness Pope Francis has rightly implored the world, this is a moral calling.  

In just two months, the world has an opportunity to unite around a strong global agreement.  I saw President Hollande walk in a few moments ago -- we are going to be converging in Paris.  With his leadership, and the leadership of every world leader, we need to establish the tools and financing to help developing nations embrace clean energy, adapt to climate change, and ensure that there’s not a false choice between economic development and the best practices that can save our planet.  We can do the same at the same time.  And the communities and lives of billions of people depend on the work that we do.  (Applause.)     

Future generations of young people watching today and tomorrow will judge us by the choices we make in the months and years ahead.  And one of those young people is Eva Tolage.  Eva lives in a village in Tanzania.  She’s 15 years old, and she wrote me a letter.  Some of you know I get 10 letters a day, mostly from inside the United States, but sometimes international letters.  I get 40,000 a day, but I read 10.  (Laughter.)  

And so Eva told me about her parents -- farmers who struggle to provide for their seven children.  And this young 15-year-old girl -- a girl the age of my daughters -- she dreams of going to college, but with little food to eat, she explained how it's hard for her sometimes to concentrate in school.  She explained that her house doesn’t have electricity, so it's hard for her to study at night.  

It's not because her parents don't love her and don't have ambitions for her.  Her father works incredibly hard in the fields to pay for her education.  But they just need a little help.  “I won’t let him down,” Eva said.  “I’ll do whatever it takes,” she said in her letter.  And then, knowing that we would be gathered at this summit to help lift up families like hers, she asked me a question that could be asked of all of our nations -- “What will you commit to doing…?”  What will you do?    

And there are billions of boys and girls just like Eva.  They’re just like our children.  They have as much talent and as much hope for the future.  And they’re willing to work hard, and their parents love them just as much as we love ours.  And just by the accident of birth, it's so much more difficult for them to achieve their dreams as it is for our children.  But in the eyes of God, they are the same children.  They’re just as important.

And for Eva, and all those just trying to survive another day in conditions that many of us can barely imagine, it can sometimes seem as if the world is blind to their struggles and their dreams.  And so today, I say to Eva and hundreds of millions -- billions -- like her:  We see you.  We hear you.  I've read your letter.  And we commit ourselves -- as nations, as one world -- to the urgent work that must be done.  To standing with families like Eva’s as they work and strive for a better life.  To ending the injustice of extreme poverty.  To upholding the inherent dignity of every human being.  Whatever it takes.  We can’t let them down.  And with your help, we won't.  

Thank you very much.  (Applause.)  ",President,Barack Obama,https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/the-press-office/2015/09/27/remarks-president-sustainable-development-goals,,DEVELOPMENT
USA,20-12-2014,Barack Obama,"
Weekly Address: America’s Resurgence Is Real"," Hi, everybody.  As 2014 comes to an end, we can enter the New Year with new confidence that America is making significant strides where it counts.

The steps we took nearly six years ago to rescue our economy and rebuild it on a new foundation helped make 2014 the strongest year for job growth since the 1990s.  Over the past 57 months, our businesses have created nearly 11 million new jobs.  And in a hopeful sign for middle-class families, wages are on the rise again.

Our investments in American manufacturing have helped fuel its best stretch of job growth since the ‘90s.  America is now the number one producer of oil and gas, saving drivers about 70 cents a gallon at the pump over last Christmas.  The auto industry we rescued is on track for its strongest year since 2005.  Thanks to the Affordable Care Act, about 10 million Americans have gained health insurance in the past year alone.  And since I took office, we have cut our deficits by about two-thirds.

Meanwhile, around the world, America is leading.  We’re leading the coalition to degrade and ultimately destroy ISIL.  We’re leading the global fight to combat the Ebola outbreak in West Africa.  We’re leading global efforts to address climate change, including last month’s joint announcement with China.  We’re turning a new page in our relationship with the Cuban people. 

And in less than two weeks, after more than 13 years, our combat mission in Afghanistan will be over, and our war there will come to a responsible end.  Today, more of our troops are home for the holidays than at any time in over a decade.  Still, many of our men and women in uniform will spend this Christmas in harm’s way.  And as Commander-in-Chief, I want our troops to know:  your country is united in our support and gratitude for you and your families.

The six years since the financial crisis have demanded hard work and sacrifice on everyone’s part.  But as a country, we have every right to be proud of what we’ve got to show for it.  More jobs.  More insured.  A growing economy.  Shrinking deficits.  Bustling industry.  Booming energy.

Pick any metric you want – America’s resurgence is real.  And we now have the chance to reverse the decades-long erosion of middle-class jobs and incomes.  We just have to invest in the things that we know will secure even faster growth in higher-paying jobs for more Americans.  We have to make sure our economy, our justice system, and our government work not only for a few, but for all of us.  And I look forward to working together with the new Congress next year on these priorities. 

Sure, we’ll disagree on some things.  We’ll have to compromise on others.  I’ll act on my own when it’s necessary.  But I will never stop trying to make life better for people like you. 

Because thanks to your efforts, a new foundation is laid.  A new future is ready to be written.  We have set the stage for a new American moment, and I’m going to spend every minute of my last two years making sure we seize it. 

On behalf of the Obama family, I wish all of you a very Merry Christmas.

Thanks, and have a wonderful holiday season.",President,Barack Obama,https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/the-press-office/2014/12/20/weekly-address-america-s-resurgence-real,,DEVELOPMENT
China,24-09-2013 00:00,H.E. Wang Yi,Sustainable Development––The Road to Achieve Chinese Dream and Human Progress,"Ms. Chair,
Dear Colleagues,
Ladies and Gentlemen,

Let me begin by extending congratulations, on behalf of the Chinese government, on the official inauguration of the High-level Political Forum on Sustainable Development. This forum is the core mechanism in the UN endeavor to promote sustainable development. We are confident that it will play a positive role.

Ms. Chair,

The concept of sustainable development was formally introduced at the UN Conference on Environment and Development in 1992. Yet the idea had never been new to the Chinese people. Concepts of harmony between man and nature and not to drain the pond to catch the fish have always been part of the fine traditional Chinese culture and today they are as appealing as ever.

Sustainable development is a basic state policy of China. The Chinese government makes it clear that we cannot repeat the old way of ""pollution first, treatment afterwards"" and that we must be responsible for our future generations and the international community. We are now actively implementing a scientific outlook on development that puts people first and promotes comprehensive, coordinated and sustainable development. We will grow the economy and, at the same time, protect the environment to safeguard the fundamental and long-term interests of the people.

China is now the world's largest investor in new and renewable energies. In the first decade of the new century, we increased forest coverage in China by 3.8% or 365,100 square kilometers.

We have identified energy-saving and emission-reduction as a focal point in adjusting our economic structure and an important yardstick in evaluating the performance of our government officials. With the promulgation of laws and regulations such as the Law on Renewable Energy and Energy Conservation Law, China now has a fairly well-established legal framework for environmental protection.

From 2005 to 2010, we cut energy consumption by 630 million tons of standard coal equivalent through energy saving and energy efficiency improvement, which equals 1.46 billion tons less of CO2 emission. Now we are fighting for the goal of reducing energy consumption and CO2 emission per unit of GDP by 16% and 17% respectively between 2011 and 2015.

This month, we have just unveiled an action plan on air pollution prevention and control, which requires us to raise the share of non-fossil fuel consumption to 13% of the total energy consumption, and decrease that of coal to less than 65% by 2017.

Given China's national conditions and development level, we will face many difficulties and pains on the way to sustainable development. But we are determined to fight this uphill battle and stick to this path as it is the only road to realize the Chinese dream. Our efforts will pay off as we move forward.

Let me give you an example. In Kubuqi, the seventh largest desert in China, sand used to encroach on human habitat and local people were threatened by wind and sand day and night. Then, they changed their line of thinking and decided to make something out of the sand. They began to plant a special kind of willow on the barren land and make construction materials from sand, thus tackling the sand problem and growing the economy at the same time. Now more than 5,000 square kilometers of their land have turned green, annual precipitation has increased from 70 mm to over 300 mm and wildlife have returned. This is a win-win scenario between the environment and economic development.

Ms. Chair,

From Vision to Action, the theme of today's round-table meeting, has shown us the way to realize sustainable development globally as well as the direction for the forum. In this connection, I wish to make the following proposals:

First, we must strive to promote ecological progress. To do this, the key is to respect the law of nature, follow nature's will, and foster a sound interaction between economic growth, social progress and environmental protection. This is what mankind has learnt from the past and the common undertaking and pursuit of the international community today. China now regards ecological progress as being no less important than economic growth, and is mobilizing the entire country behind this endeavor. We see environmental protection as a precondition and opportunity for economic development. While we want prosperity and wealth, we also want clear waters and green mountains. In fact, clear waters and green mountains can bring us prosperity and wealth.

Second, we have to foster a favorable environment for sustainable development. Sustainable development cannot gain ground in the absence of a real and solid recovery of the global economy and a sound international trade and investment climate. We should improve global economic governance and make it fairer and more equitable. We should uphold a free, open and non-discriminatory multilateral trading system, and oppose protectionism in all forms. We should better prepare ourselves for cross-border financial risks, discuss ways to improve global investment norms and encourage rational and well-managed flow of global capital. We should build a global value chain that shares interest and foster a big global market that benefits all, so as to achieve development with win-win results.

Third, we should adhere to the principle of ""common but differentiated responsibilities"". Sustainable development is a common cause for all mankind, to which all countries should contribute as much as they can. However, given their different basic national conditions, developing countries, including the emerging economies, and developed countries have different historical responsibilities and immediate obligations. ""Common but differentiated responsibilities"" is a fundamental principle in the area of development. Imposing uniformity and ignoring differences is to dodge or even shirk the responsibilities of developed countries. International cooperation on sustainable development must take into full account the differences between developed and developing countries in level, resources and means of development. Concrete efforts should be made to address the difficulties of developing countries in capital, technology, capacity building and other means of implementation.

Fourth, we need to put social issues high on the agenda. A country's strength and prosperity requires more than economic growth, and sustainable development is not ""sustainable economic development"" only. Harmony, progress, fairness and justice of the society are also crucial. We believe that the assurance and improvement of people's well-being should be given greater importance. The pursuit of economic growth must be accompanied by the efforts to strengthen social development, improve the basic public service system, and make innovations in social governance. Social issues of people's immediate interest, such as schooling, medical care, housing, old-age care and social security should be properly handled, so that everyone contributes to and benefits from development.

Fifth, we should innovate in the thinking, model and method of development. Traditional ways of development, depleting resources and damaging the environment, have proved to be unsustainable. Greater efforts should be made to raise the quality and efficiency of development, adjust the structure of economy and improve the distribution of industries. Single-minded pursuit of speed and quantity should be avoided.

Real economy, the manufacturing industry and agriculture in particular, is the lifeline for many developing countries and should be strengthened and expanded. Financial industries should serve the real economy, not the other way round.

Inadequate infrastructure is the weak link of developing economies, while investing in infrastructure is an important way to overcome the financial crisis. Therefore, it is necessary to build partnerships on infrastructure development and set up investment and financing platforms in this regard.

Emerging industries and technologies in such areas as clean energy, energy saving and emissions reduction are becoming new growth points in the world economy. Scientific and technological innovation can provide a strong driving force for sustainable development. We should encourage technological breakthroughs and technology transfer from the North to the South so as to boost the development of green production forces.

Ms. Chair,

The establishment of this forum brings opportunities for sustainable development. I hope the forum's work will be down to earth and efficient, generating solutions while conducting discussions, and take actions while making decisions. To move from vision to action calls for sincerity and efforts of all countries. The Chinese government has been making its best effort to support other developing countries in pursuing sustainable development. We have arranged for RMB200 million to support small island states, the least developed countries and African countries in tackling climate change, and taken the lead in donating US$500,000 to the third International Conference on Sustainable Development of Small Island Developing States to be held in 2014.

The UN Conference on Sustainable Development in 2012 has depicted for us ""the future we want"". China actively supports and pursues sustainable development. We will strive to build a beautiful China and make greater contribution to making our planet Earth a lovely home for mankind.

Thank you.",State Councilor and Foreign Minister of the People's Republic of China,Xi Jinping,https://www.fmprc.gov.cn/mfa_eng/wjdt_665385/zyjh_665391/t1081238.shtml,,DEVELOPMENT
Russia,27-12-2005,Vladimir Putin,Opening Address at the State Council Session “On Immediate Measures for the Implementation of Priority National Projects”,"Good afternoon, dear colleagues!

Our session is taking place literally several days before the beginning of 2006. And one of the most significant political events of this year was undoubtedly beginning to work on the highest priority questions and issues the country is confronted with, something we refer to as national projects.

As you know, this work will enter a completely new phase next year—the phase of the pragmatic realization of the most pressing issues.

In this connection, I considered it particularly important that here with you, my dear colleagues at the State Council, we discuss these basic questions, establish the means of collaboration between the agencies of federal and regional power, and thereby define precisely the forms of this cooperation. I consider this to be extremely important.

I think that you too understand that we are obliged to consolidate as much as possible our efforts so that the most essential, vital problems for people have been solved in the most effective way. These tasks, as we recall, are in the fields of education, public health services, housing, and agriculture.

A great deal of the preparatory work has already been done and important legal acts have been passed. From the first months of the coming year they will facilitate the transition to effecting various measures concerning the projects.

You know that next year we shall be spending more than 160 billion roubles on these projects. I want to point out that this impressive amount imposes on all of us a great responsibility, and requires us to work harmoniously and efficiently together.

All of us used to complain that there was never enough, never enough money. Now we have as much as we can cope with. I say again: it is necessary to spend it competently and efficiently.

We should achieve substantial results. But it is also necessary to understand — and you too are aware of this — that, for example, in order to increase the availability of housing, a significant modernization of the sector of housing construction is required. It is not enough to just allocate the money to this program; it is necessary to undertake decisive steps to improve the way the economy works as a whole and in this sector in particular.

For us it is obvious: in order for a housing program to start up in earnest, it is necessary to sort out issues related to the question of land ownership, the politics of town planning, municipal services, and access to medical care and education. We must achieve a higher level of work in these establishments and in the various branches as a whole.

From this it follows that the so-called expanded government, that is the Federal government and the governors, which are represented in this hall, should work more efficiently and more effectively — as a single corporation. And it is precisely now that this stage is beginning, when subjects of the Russian Federation should turn in earnest to practical work. It is obvious that a higher level of readiness on location will directly influence the results of efforts of all government power to accomplish the tasks under discussion today.

It is the regions together with municipalitieswho will be organizing timely financial payments. It will be necessary to coordinate closely both purchases, installing the equipment, and constructing new installations, in order to determine the recipients of additional and expensive medical services.

Certainly, the broad spectrum of such crucial problems demands a well-defined administrative system to oversee the projects and the creation of a thorough control system, a system that guarantees coordination and coherence at all stages of our work, where every link in the chain — from federal departments to establishments on location – must operate according to general principles and procedures.

I also insist that you attend assiduously to the expenditure of financial resources. The government's task is to find the most economic way to transfer these public funds to their ultimate recipients within the allotted time frame and at a minimal cost. And the state cannot begin to pay inflated prices to implement the measures related to these projects. It should not pay for the negligence of specific officials, or for their slow actions.

As far as prices are concerned, that is a special case and a special subject. Everything should be organized in the most efficient and, I repeat, the most up-to-date way, so that not a single penny is spent illicitly.

Therefore simultaneously and in parallel with the realization of the projects it is necessary to begin monitoring immediate measures already taken. Here again the major question is control over the purpose of utilization, over – let me say it straight out – the commercial effectiveness of every rouble spent. And to realize this sort of control in practice it is necessary for public control to really function—I have already spoken about this.

Dear members of the State Council!

In conclusion I shall note again that the governors directly influence the financial and economic policy of the regions. And you all know all about the ideology behind financing national projects. It does not presuppose the passive distribution of money or substituting regional and local programmes at the expense of the federal government in the fields of public health services, education, housing policy, or agriculture.

Almost two thirds of all funds allocated towards meeting the social needs of the citizens of the country are channelled through the budgets of the territories, and we are helping to resolve a lot of additional issues by virtue of financing these projects. I want to emphasize that these are additional issues. Therefore it would be wrong if substantial work in priority areas was replaced by simply profiting from subventions from the federal budget.

I hope that the Russian regions will invest their own resources in the projects and invest not only through financial means but also by efficiently organizing administrative work.

I draw your attention to the fact that the extent to which national projects are implemented effectively should become the criterion, in any event one of the major criteria, for evaluating local authorities.

I thank you for your attention and I turn the floor over to Dmitry Anatolevich Medvedev. Please go ahead.",President,Vladimir Putin,http://en.kremlin.ru/events/president/transcripts/statements/23362,,DEVELOPMENT
USA,15-11-2017 00:00,Donald Trump,Remarks by President Trump on His Trip to Asia,"THE PRESIDENT: Thank you very much.

Last night, I returned from a historic 12-day trip to Asia. This journey took us to five nations to meet with dozens of foreign leaders, participate in three formal state visits, and attend three key regional summits. It was the longest visit to the region by an American President in more than a quarter of a century.

Everywhere we went, our foreign hosts greeted the American delegation, myself included, with incredible warmth, hospitality, and most importantly respect. And this great respect showed very well our country is — further evidence that America’s renewed confidence and standing in the world has never been stronger than it is right now.

When we are confident in ourselves, our strength, our flag, our history, our values — other nations are confident in us. And when we treat our citizens with the respect they deserve, other countries treat America with the respect that our country so richly deserves.

During our travels, this is exactly what the world saw: a strong, proud, and confident America.
Today, I want to update the American people on the tremendous success of this trip and the progress we’ve made to advance American security and prosperity throughout the year.

When I came into office, our country was faced with a series of growing dangers. These threats included rogue regimes pursuing deadly weapons, foreign powers challenging America’s influence, the spread of the murderous terror group ISIS, and years of unfair trade practices that had dangerously depleted our manufacturing base and wiped out millions and millions of middle-class jobs.

The challenges were inherited, and these products really showed what previous mistakes were made over many years — and even decades — by other administrations. Some of these mistakes were born of indifference and neglect. Others from naïve thinking and misguided judgement. In some cases, the negative influence of partisan politics and special interests was to blame. But the one common thread behind all of these problems was a failure to protect and promote the interests of the American people and American workers.

Upon my inauguration, I pledged that we would rebuild America, restore its economic strength, and defend its national security. With this goal in mind, I vowed that we would reaffirm old alliances and form new friendships in pursuit of shared goals. Above all, I swore that in every decision, with every action, I would put the best interests of the American people first.
Over the past 10 months, traveling across the globe and meeting with world leaders, that is exactly what I have done.

Earlier this year, in Saudi Arabia, I spoke to the leaders of more than 50 Arab and Muslim nations about our strategy to defeat terrorists by stripping them of financing, territory, and ideological support. And I urged the leaders to drive out the terrorists and extremists from their societies. Since that time, we have dealt ISIS one crushing defeat after another.

In Israel, I reaffirmed the unbreakable bond between America and the Jewish State, and I met with leaders of the Palestinian Authority and initiated an effort to facilitate lasting peace between the Israelis and the Palestinians.

In Brussels, I urged our NATO allies to do more to strengthen our crucial alliance and set the stage for significant increases in member contributions. Billions and billions of dollars are pouring in because of that initiative. NATO, believe me, is very happy with Donald Trump and what I did.
In Warsaw, I declared to the world America’s resolve to preserve and protect Western civilization and the values we hold so dear.

In Rome, Sicily, Hamburg, and Paris, I strengthened our friendships with key allies to promote our shared interests of security and prosperity.

In September, at the United Nations General Assembly in New York, I urged that the nations of the world join in confronting rogue regimes that threaten humanity and laid out a model for international cooperation grounded in respect for sovereignty and the responsibilities that come with it.

On each trip, I have worked to advance American interests and leadership in the world.
And to each of these places, I have carried our vision for a better — a vision for something stronger and sovereign — so important — sovereign and independent nations, rooted in their histories, confident in their destinies, and cooperating together to advance their security, prosperity, and the noble cause of peace.

It was this same vision that I carried to Asia two weeks ago. And it was this same commitment to you, the American people, that was always at the forefront of my mind and my thinking.
Our trip was defined by three core goals. First: to unite the world against the nuclear menace posed by the North Korean regime, a threat that has increased steadily through many administrations and now requires urgent action.

Second: to strengthen America’s alliances and economic partnerships in a free and open Indo-Pacific, made up of thriving, independent nations, respectful of other countries and their own citizens, and safe from foreign domination and economic servitude.

And third: to finally — after many years — insist on fair and reciprocal trade. Fair and reciprocal trade — so important. These two words — fairness and reciprocity — are an open invitation to every country that seeks to do business with the United States, and they are a firm warning to every country that cheats, breaks the rules, and engages in economic aggression — like they’ve been doing in the past, especially in the recent past.

That is why we have almost an $800-billion-a-year trade deficit with other nations. Unacceptable. We are going to start whittling that down, and as fast as possible.

With these goals, it was my profound honor to travel on this journey as your representative. I explained to all of the world leaders, and across Asia, how well the United States is doing. Economic growth has been over 3 percent the last two quarters and is going higher.

Unemployment is at its lowest level in 17 years. The stock market has gained trillions of dollars in value since my election and has reached record highs. We are massively increasing our military budget to historic levels. The House has just passed a nearly $700 billion defense package, and it could not come at a better time for our nation.

Once again our country is optimistic about the future, confident in our values, and proud of our history and a role in the world.

I want to thank every citizen of this country for the part you have played in making this great American comeback possible. In Asia, our message was clear and well received: America is here to compete, to do business, and to defend our values and our security.

We began our trip in Hawaii to pay our respects to brave American servicemembers at Pearl Harbor and the United States Pacific Command, the guardian of our security and freedom across the Indo-Pacific region.

As our country prepared to observe Veterans Day, we remembered the incredible sacrifices and courage of all of the veterans whose service has preserved our liberty and a way of life that is very special. We also thanked military families for their support for our brave servicemen and women.
From Hawaii, we traveled to Japan, a crucial U.S. ally and partner in the region. Upon landing in Japan, my first act was to thank the American servicemembers and Japanese Self-Defense Forces who personify the strength of our enduring alliance.

Prime Minister Abe and I agreed on our absolute determination to remain united to achieve the goal of denuclearized North Korea. Shortly following our visit, Japan announced additional sanctions on 35 North Korean entities and individuals. Japan also committed to shouldering more of the burden of our common defense by reimbursing costs borne by American taxpayers, as well as by making deep investments in Japan’s own military. This will include purchases of U.S. advanced capabilities — from jet fighters to missile defense systems worth many, many billions of dollars — and jobs for the American worker.

The Prime Minister and I also discussed ways we can deepen our trade relationship based on the core principles of fairness and reciprocity. I am pleased that since January of this year, Japanese companies have announced investments in the United States worth more than $8 billion — 17,000 jobs. Thank you.

Oh, they don’t have water? That’s okay. What? That’s okay.

(Drinks water.)

THE PRESIDENT: Japanese manufacturers, Toyota and Mazda, announced that they will be opening a new plant in the United States that will create 4,000 jobs.

We also signed agreements between our nations to enhance infrastructure development, increase access to affordable energy, and advance our foreign policy goals through economic investment.
From Japan, we traveled to another key American ally in Asia — the Republic of Korea. My official state visit to South Korea was the first by an American President in 25 years.

Speaking before the National Assembly of the Republic of Korea, I spoke the truth about the evil crimes of the North Korean regime, and I made clear that we will not allow this twisted dictatorship to hold the world hostage to nuclear blackmail.

I called on every nation, including China and Russia, to unite in isolating the North Korean regime — cutting off all ties of trade and commerce — until it stops its dangerous provocation on — and this is the whole key to what we’re doing — on denuclearization. We have to denuclearize North Korea.

We have ended the failed strategy of strategic patience, and, as a result, we have already seen important progress — including tough new sanctions from the U.N. council — we have a Security Council that has been with us and just about with us from the beginning.

South Korea agreed to harmonize sanctions and joined the United States in sanctioning additional rogue actors whose fund and funds have helped North Korea and North Korea’s nuclear and ballistic missile programs. It’s unacceptable to us.

The United States welcomed the decision of President Moon to remove the payload restrictions on missiles to combat the North Korean threat. And together we reaffirmed our commitment to a campaign of maximum pressure.

Like Japan, South Korea is increasing its defense contributions. During our meetings, President Moon acknowledged his desire for equitable cost-sharing for the United States military forces stationed in South Korea. And I visited soldiers at Camp Humphreys, a brand-new, joint American-South Korean base, paid for almost entirely by the South Korean government. At that base, I discussed with the United States and South Korean military leaders both military options and readiness to respond to North Korean provocation or offensive actions.

During our visit, President Moon and I also discussed America’s commitment to reducing our trade deficit with South Korea. At my discretion and direction, we are currently renegotiating the disastrous U.S.-Korea trade agreement signed under the previous administration. It has been a disaster for the United States.

Last week, 42 South Korean companies announced their intent to invest in projects worth more than $17 billion dollars in the United States, and 24 companies announced plans to purchase $58 billion dollars in American goods and services.

From South Korea, Melania and I traveled to China, where, as in Japan and South Korea, we were greatly honored by the splendor of our reception. Our trip included the first official dinner held for a foreign leader in the Forbidden City since the founding of the modern China, where we enjoyed a very productive evening hosted by President Xi and his wonderful wife, Madam Peng.

During our visit, President Xi pledged to faithfully implement United Nations Security Council resolutions on North Korea and to use his great economic influence over the regime to achieve our common goal of a denuclearized Korean Peninsula.

President Xi recognizes that a nuclear North Korea is a grave threat to China, and we agreed that we would not accept a so-called “freeze for freeze” agreement like those that have consistently failed in the past. We made that time is running out and we made it clear, and all options remain on the table.

I also had very candid conversations with President Xi about the need to reduce our staggering trade deficit with China and for our trading relationship to be conducted on a truly fair and equitable basis. We can no longer tolerate unfair trading practices that steal American jobs, wealth, and intellectual property. The days of the United States being taken advantage of are over.

In China, we also announced $250 billion worth in trade-investment deals that will create jobs in the United States.

From China, I flew to the city of Da Nang in Vietnam, to attend the Leaders Meeting for APEC — Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation. There, I spoke to a major gathering of business leaders, where I reminded the world of America’s historic role in the Pacific as a force for freedom and for peace.

Standing on this proud history, I offered our vision for robust trading relationships in which Indo-Pacific nations can all prosper and grow together. I announced that the United States is ready to make bilateral trade deals with any nation in the region that wants to be our partner in fair and reciprocal trade.

We will never again turn a blind eye to trading abuses, to cheating, economic aggression, or anything else from countries that profess a belief in open trade, but do not follow the rules or live by its principles themselves.

No international trading organization can function if members are allowed to exploit the openness of others for unfair economic gain. Trade abuses harm the United States and its workers — but no more. No more.

We will take every trade action necessary to achieve the fair and reciprocal treatment that the United States has offered to the rest of the world for decades.

My message has resonated. The 21 APEC leaders — for the first time ever — recognized the importance of fair and reciprocal trade, recognized the need to address unfair trade practices, and acknowledged that the WTO is in strong need of reform. These leaders also noted that countries must do a better job following the rules to which they agreed.

I also made very clear that the United States will promote a free and open Indo-Pacific in which nations enjoy the independence and respect they deserve.

In Vietnam, during a state visit in Hanoi, I also met with President Quang and Prime Minister Fook to discuss the growing friendship between our countries. Our Vietnamese partners are taking new actions to enforce sanctions on North Korea. In addition, we committed to expand trade and investment between our countries, and we pledged to address the imbalances. I am particularly pleased that the United States and Vietnam recently announced $12 billion in commercial agreements, which will include $10 billion in U.S. content.

Finally, I visited the Philippines, where I met with numerous world leaders at the U.S.-ASEAN and East Asia Summits. At ASEAN — the Association of Southeast Asian Nations — we made it clear that no one owns the ocean. Freedom of navigation and overflight are critical to the security and prosperity of all nations.

I also met with the Prime Ministers of India, Australia, and Japan to discuss our shared commitment to a free and open Indo-Pacific.

During our visit, President Duterte of the Philippines thanked the American people and our armed forces for supporting the recent liberation of Marawi from ISIS. We pledged to strengthen and deepen our long-standing alliance.

At the East Asia Summit, the United States negotiated and signed four important leaders’ statements on the use of chemical weapons, money laundering, poverty alleviation, and countering terrorist propaganda and financing.

And crucially, at both summits and throughout the trip, we asked all nations to support our campaign of maximum pressure for North Korean denuclearization. And they are responding by cutting trade with North Korea, restricting financial ties to the regime, and expelling North Korean diplomats and workers.

Over the last two weeks, we have made historic strides in reasserting American leadership, restoring American security, and reawakening American confidence.

Everywhere we went, I reaffirmed our vision for cooperation between proud, independent and sovereign countries — and I made clear that the United States will be a reliable friend, a strong partner, and a powerful advocate for its own citizens.

The momentum from our trip will launch us on our continued effort to accomplish the three core objectives I outlined: to unite the world against North Korean nuclear threat, to promote a free and open Indo-Pacific region, and to advance fair and reciprocal economic relations with our trading partners and allies in the region.

We have established a new framework for trade that will ensure reciprocity through enforcement actions, reform of international organizations, and new fair trade deals that benefit the United States and our partners.

And we have laid out a pathway toward peace and security in our world where sovereign nations can thrive, flourish, and prosper side-by-side.

This is our beautiful vision for the future. This is a where this vision — this dream — is only possible if America is strong, proud, and free.

As long as we are true to ourselves, faithful to our founding, and loyal to our citizens, then there is no task too great, no dream too large, no goal beyond our reach.

My fellow citizens: America is back. And the future has never looked brighter.

Thank you. God Bless you and God Bless the United States of America. Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you all.",President,Donald Trump,https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefings-statements/remarks-president-trump-trip-asia/,,INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS
Russia,28-04-2001,Vladimir Putin,From a Speech at a Meeting on Improving Labour Relations,"We know very well that today the trade unions are under no pressure from the state, I think you are aware of that and you proceed in accordance with this premise. But it would be wrong if federal, regional and local authorities and the trade unions worked separately from each other. We must be partners helping each other in the performance of our functions, especially since the governments at every level and the trade unions at every level have basically the same targets: the social well-being of Russian citizens; neither the trade unions nor the Government have or should have any other objective.

The character of labour in Russia has changed dramatically in recent times. Market relations have become a reality, and that of course has changed the very essence of the work of the trade unions, and this topic merits discussion – especially since labour relations are a significant potential source of conflict, as we know only too well. Our task is to minimise that potential on the one hand and to make the work of the trade unions as effective as possible, on the other.

In Soviet times – and many of you were already active in the trade union movement in those times – the trade unions were referred to as “a school for communism”. Obviously, in the present-day context, the trade unions cannot and must not be an educational establishment. They are key instruments in promoting the interests of the workers and this is the only criterion for trade unions individually and the trade union movement as a whole.

The movement is only gathering momentum here. While developed industrialised Western countries have stable legislation and a fully-fledged trade union movement, our trade unions are emerging and the legal framework is just being put in place.

I would like to stress the urgent need for labour legislation in this sphere. We need legislation that will protect both the employees and the employers, and I would like to stress that.

You know that the new tasks and new methods are a response to the exigencies of our time. We have more than 80% of companies in which the Government has a less than a 50% stake.

<…>

I think the Government should strike a balance between promoting market relations on the one hand and social justice on the other.

I think – and this is my personal view – that the trade unions should be a key instrument for achieving such a balance, while the Government should guarantee that the agreements between employers and employees and their associations are honoured.

What did I mean when I spoke about the balance of interests? I would like to speak about it briefly. People employed by businesses should be protected against administrative abuses, and the trade unions have a huge role to play in that; but we cannot tolerate the other extreme: our actions must not hinder the development of companies or keep labour productivity at a low level or preserve outdated forms of labour organisation, because ultimately the people themselves suffer. If a company is antiquated and operates at a loss, one cannot expect higher wages or a higher level of prosperity in general. We should all understand it. And I think this is the meaning of social partnership: it is not just about mutual interests, social partnership is also about the mutual responsibility of the employers and the employees and, I repeat, their associations.

Giving promises we know we cannot fulfil is one of our teething troubles, and has been throughout the previous decade. We are gradually getting rid of that affliction at the government level. And we are doing everything possible to ensure that the Government’s social obligations to the people are fulfilled. But, I repeat, they must be realistic because the worst thing that can happen is when the Government assumes obligations and fails to deliver. It is worse than assuming modest obligations, but fulfilling them. Then at least the people keep their faith in the Government and other institutions closely linked with the Government.

There is, of course, another ingrained habit, the habit of saving on the cheapest commodity, if one can call it that, namely, the workforce. That too has become a reality. On the one hand, cheap labour is a substantial factor of economic development, but on the other hand the cheapness may become a brake on the economy, not to speak of the social deprivations that it implies.

The trade unions have a huge role to play in correcting these distortions. For example, the substance of collective agreements is changing, and rightly so, I think. Increasingly they are becoming an effective mechanism in determining the true value of labour and fair pay. I want you to note that the latest changes in tax legislation, in particular, in social tax legislation, are aimed at bringing wages out of the shadow. I think this is in the interests of the workers above all, although I agree with those who think that not enough has been done in that way.

The changes that have taken place, unfortunately, have not yet made any difference to small and medium sized businesses and many provincial workers because their wages are not the same as in the capitals. I think the Government must draw conclusions from that and take the necessary steps to cut down on bureaucracy in this sphere and reduce social taxes, especially the wage tax.

Furthermore, we must work together to develop the labour market. And I think in this case we would do well to recall what the trade unions did in the past. Not everything that was done in the past should be denigrated and forgotten. In the past the trade unions were engaged in retraining personnel for new jobs, and that activity now takes on a new significance, it becomes a priority to be addressed jointly by the Government and employers. This is especially relevant to the provinces and small communities and towns: people there suffer the most when the core activities of local companies change because it is impossible to find a new job without the appropriate retraining.

USA,15-06-2017 00:00,Donald Trump,Remarks by President Trump at Signing of an Executive Order on Apprenticeship and Workforce of Tomorrow Initiatives,"THE PRESIDENT:  Hello, everybody.  Thank you.  Good morning.  Thank you for all being here.  Before beginning today, I’d like to take a moment to again send our thoughts and prayers to my friend, and the friend of most of us in this room, Steve Scalise, and his great family as he continues his very brave fight.

It’s been much more difficult than people even thought at the time.  It’s been — he’s in some trouble, but he’s a great fighter and he’s going to be okay, we hope.

I visited Steve and his family at the hospital last night, and I reassured them that the entire country is pulling for them, praying for them, and that we are here for them every single step of the way.  America’s hearts — and we mean this in the truest sense — sends its love.  We got a lot of hearts in this country, great hearts, and they’re all sending their love and support to the Scalise Family.

And Steve, in his own way, may have brought some unity to our long-divided country.  We’ve had a very, very divided country for many years.  And I have a feeling that Steve has made a great sacrifice, but there could be some unity being brought to our country.  Let’s hope so.

While at the hospital, I also visited with Special Agent Crystal Griner — a terrific young woman — of the Capitol Police and her family.  Crystal is one of the two Capitol Police officers who saved so many lives through her heroism, along with Special Agent David Bailey.  They ran right into the fire.  They ran right into those guns and the bullets, and they saved a lot of lives.  America salutes both of their courage.  They have great, great courage.  We all salute them.

We also salute the men and women of the Alexandria Police, Fire and Rescue, and all of the first responders.  The timing and speed and the professionalism was incredible.  They performed with bravery and with skill.

Finally, our heartfelt prayers go out to Matt Mika, who was badly wounded in the assault.  To Matt’s family:  Anything you need, we are here for you.  Hopefully, Matt will be okay.

In these difficult hours, it’s more important than ever to help each other, care for each other, and remind each other that we are all united by our love of our great and beautiful country.

We’re joined today by Secretary Acosta, Secretary Ross, and Administrator McMahon as we prepare to make a historic announcement to train Americans for the jobs of the future.  We have a lot of companies moving into this country.  You see the unemployment rate is at a very, very low level.  Job enthusiasm and manufacturing, business enthusiasm is at record levels — never been higher.  A lot of good numbers are coming out, including almost $4 trillion in gain to the stock markets since the election — $4 trillion.  We just signed a big deal yesterday for hundreds of millions of dollars’ worth of equipment and military equipment going to be made in this country, in our country, for other countries.

We’ve got it going.  We have to make sure the people are here and they’re going to be well trained.

So I want to thank my daughter Ivanka and her leadership.  She has worked so hard on this.  She understands how important it is.  We’re training people to have great jobs and high-paying jobs.

And we’re here today to celebrate the dignity of work — it’s really a good term — dignity of work — and the greatness of the American worker, which I’ve been celebrating for a long time.  Probably wouldn’t be here if it weren’t for the American worker.

And the American worker sees what’s happening in Michigan and in Ohio and in a lot of places that we’ve had a huge impact on just in a short period of time that I’ve been here and this administration has been involved.  We have a lot of companies moving in, a lot of plants are going to be built.  A lot of plants are being expanded, and big ones are going to be announced very soon.  You’re going to hear some very big names that I can’t tell you about now.  We want to get them signed on the dotted line.  We don’t want to talk too quickly.  It’s called “sign them on the dotted line,” right?  (Laughter.)

In just a few moments, I’ll be signing an executive order to expand apprenticeships and vocational training to help all Americans find a rewarding career, earn a great living, and support themselves and their families, and love going to work in the morning.

We will be removing federal restrictions that have prevented many different industries from creating apprenticeship programs.  We have regulations on top of regulations.  And in history, nobody has gotten rid of so many regulations at the Trump administration.  And that’s one of the reasons that you see the jobs and the companies all kicking in so strongly.  I think some very good numbers are going to be announced, by the way, in the very near future as to GDP.

So we’re empowering these companies, these unions, industry groups, federal agencies to go out and create new apprenticeships for millions of our citizens.  Apprenticeships place students into great jobs without the crippling debt of traditional four-year college degrees.  Instead, apprentices earn while they learn — which is an expression we’re using:  Earn while you learn.

We’re joined today by apprentices who know firsthand how these programs can bring new hope and new opportunities.  We’re also joined by some of the country’s great governors, and I appreciate them very, very much for being here.  We just had a meeting in the Cabinet Room.

Charles Robel is here with us from Wisconsin, where I just left, actually, yesterday.  I was with Governor Walker.  Charles is a three-time combat veteran who bravely served our nation — highly respected.  After Charles came back from the war, he, like so many other Americans, faced very tough economic times.

Charles began taking machine tool operation courses from a technical college.  He immediately excelled.  He was really, really good at it, they say.  That’s what they say.  I haven’t checked.  (Laughter.)  Where is Charles?  Come here.  (Laughter.)  Charles, they tell me.  I haven’t checked it.  I want to check you out, all right?  (Laughter.)  But he immediately excelled. And by the end of his year-long apprenticeship, Charles will be making more than $60,000 a year and going up a lot higher than that.  And he loves what he does.  I think you really love it, right?  Yes, loves it.

Charles, we thank you for your service to a country — to our country, both in the military and in exactly what you’re doing right now, which is so important.  And we congratulate you on this exciting new career, and you’re going to have some great future.  Thank you, Charles, appreciate it.  (Applause.)

Each of the apprentices here today has their own story and their own dreams — that’s what they are — dreams.

Apprenticeships teach striving Americans the skills they need to operate incredible machines.  And some of these machines are so intricate, so powerful, and, really — the word is — they are incredible.  This is not the old days; this is new and computerized and complicated, and you really have to know what you’re doing.  But they create amazing products.  And to construct skyscrapers that touch the clouds. — I mean, you look at the equipment today, and just go back 10 years ago and 20 years ago, it’s from a different world, from a different planet.   It’s incredible.

I just met with the governors from many of the states to discuss how we can work with them to expand apprenticeships and the apprentice programs.  I’m also delighted to be here with CEOs of major companies who support our apprenticeship initiatives.   And we had a tremendous number of the biggest CEOs in the world here yesterday.  We talked about this also and they are fully behind it, including our effort to help millions of talented young American women thrive and flourish in our economy.

We are thrilled, as well, to have with us today Congressman Bobby Scott and Congresswoman Virginia Foxx, who care so deeply about this effort.  (Applause.)  Thank you.

The strength of our nation will be determined by our ability to keep jobs in America, and we’re going to keep them in America.   You’re not going to have companies fleeing like in the past.  There’s going to be a big price to pay for companies that want to leave, fire their workers, build a plant outside of this country, and think they’re going to sell their product right back into the United States.  There’s going to be a big price to pay.

But we want to keep jobs in America and we want to train people and hire American workers to fill those jobs.   And that’s exactly what we’re doing, and we’re really doing a job of it.  And I just want to thank all of our secretaries and everybody involved in the process.

Not only will our apprentices transform their lives, but they will also transform our lives in the truest sense.  Today’s apprentices will construct the roads and bridges that move our citizens, they will bend the metal and steel that shape our cities, and they will pioneer the new technology that drives our commerce.
But as we train the next generation of Americans to do their jobs, all of us here today have to do our jobs:  We have to join forces, join hands, and join together to restore the American Dream for all of our people.

And one of the parts of the American Dream is we’re going to come down very, very hard — and we already have; you’ve seen what’s going on the border — on this massive drug problem that we have in the United States and, frankly, that other countries have also.  And we’re coming down very, very hard on it.   And if we don’t, it’s called shame on us.

So everybody that has worked so hard on this program and everybody in this room, including the reporters, God bless you — (laughter) — God bless America.  And let’s go out and let’s do a really terrific job with the apprentice program.

Thank you very much.  Thank you very much.  Appreciate it.  (Applause.)

USA,17-10-2013,Barack Obama,"
Remarks by the President on the Reopening of the Government","Good morning, everybody.  Please have a seat.

Well, last night, I signed legislation to reopen our government and pay America’s bills.  Because Democrats and responsible Republicans came together, the first government shutdown in 17 years is now over.  The first default in more than 200 years will not happen.  These twin threats to our economy have now been lifted.  And I want to thank those Democrats and Republicans for getting together and ultimately getting this job done. 

Now, there’s been a lot of discussion lately of the politics of this shutdown.  But let’s be clear:  There are no winners here.  These last few weeks have inflicted completely unnecessary damage on our economy.  We don’t know yet the full scope of the damage, but every analyst out there believes it slowed our growth. 

We know that families have gone without paychecks or services they depend on.  We know that potential homebuyers have gotten fewer mortgages, and small business loans have been put on hold.  We know that consumers have cut back on spending, and that half of all CEOs say that the shutdown and the threat of shutdown set back their plans to hire over the next six months.  We know that just the threat of default -- of America not paying all the bills that we owe on time -- increased our borrowing costs, which adds to our deficit. 

And, of course, we know that the American people’s frustration with what goes on in this town has never been higher. That's not a surprise that the American people are completely fed up with Washington.  At a moment when our economic recovery demands more jobs, more momentum, we've got yet another self-inflicted crisis that set our economy back.  And for what? 

There was no economic rationale for all of this.  Over the past four years, our economy has been growing, our businesses have been creating jobs, and our deficits have been cut in half. We hear some members who pushed for the shutdown say they were doing it to save the American economy -- but nothing has done more to undermine our economy these past three years than the kind of tactics that create these manufactured crises. 

And you don’t have to take my word for it.  The agency that put America’s credit rating on watch the other day explicitly cited all of this, saying that our economy “remains more dynamic and resilient” than other advanced economies, and that the only thing putting us at risk is -- and I'm quoting here -- “repeated brinksmanship.”  That's what the credit rating agency said.  That wasn’t a political statement; that was an analysis of what’s hurting our economy by people whose job it is to analyze these things. 

That also happens to be the view of our diplomats who’ve been hearing from their counterparts internationally.  Some of the same folks who pushed for the shutdown and threatened default claim their actions were needed to get America back on the right track, to make sure we're strong.  But probably nothing has done more damage to America's credibility in the world, our standing with other countries, than the spectacle that we've seen these past several weeks.  It's encouraged our enemies.  It's emboldened our competitors.  And it's depressed our friends who look to us for steady leadership.

Now, the good news is we'll bounce back from this.  We always do.  America is the bedrock of the global economy for a reason.  We are the indispensable nation that the rest of the world looks to as the safest and most reliable place to invest -- something that’s made it easier for generations of Americans to invest in their own futures.  We have earned that responsibility over more than two centuries because of the dynamism of our economy and our entrepreneurs, the productivity of our workers, but also because we keep our word and we meet our obligations.  That’s what full faith and credit means -- you can count on us. 
And today, I want our people and our businesses and the rest of the world to know that the full faith and credit of the United States remains unquestioned.

But to all my friends in Congress, understand that how business is done in this town has to change.  Because we've all got a lot of work to do on behalf of the American people -- and that includes the hard work of regaining their trust.  Our system of self-government doesn’t function without it.  And now that the government is reopened, and this threat to our economy is removed, all of us need to stop focusing on the lobbyists and the bloggers and the talking heads on radio and the professional activists who profit from conflict, and focus on what the majority of Americans sent us here to do, and that’s grow this economy; create good jobs; strengthen the middle class; educate our kids; lay the foundation for broad-based prosperity and get our fiscal house in order for the long haul.  That’s why we're here.  That should be our focus. 

Now, that won't be easy.  We all know that we have divided government right now.  There's a lot of noise out there, and the pressure from the extremes affect how a lot of members of Congress see the day-to-day work that’s supposed to be done here. And let's face it, the American people don’t see every issue the same way.  But that doesn’t mean we can't make progress.  And when we disagree, we don’t have to suggest that the other side doesn’t love this country or believe in free enterprise, or all the other rhetoric that seems to get worse every single year.  If we disagree on something, we can move on and focus on the things we agree on, and get some stuff done.

Let me be specific about three places where I believe we can make progress right now.  First, in the coming days and weeks, we should sit down and pursue a balanced approach to a responsible budget, a budget that grows our economy faster and shrinks our long-term deficits further. 

At the beginning of this year, that’s what both Democrats and Republicans committed to doing.  The Senate passed a budget; House passed a budget; they were supposed to come together and negotiate.  And had one side not decided to pursue a strategy of brinksmanship, each side could have gotten together and figured out, how do we shape a budget that provides certainty to businesses and people who rely on government, provides certainty to investors in our economy, and we’d be growing faster right now.

Now, the good news is the legislation I signed yesterday now requires Congress to do exactly that -- what it could have been doing all along. 

And we shouldn’t approach this process of creating a budget as an ideological exercise -- just cutting for the sake of cutting.  The issue is not growth versus fiscal responsibility -- we need both.  We need a budget that deals with the issues that most Americans are focused on:  creating more good jobs that pay better wages. 

And remember, the deficit is getting smaller, not bigger.  It’s going down faster than it has in the last 50 years. The challenges we have right now are not short-term deficits; it’s the long-term obligations that we have around things like Medicare and Social Security.  We want to make sure those are there for future generations. 

So the key now is a budget that cuts out the things that we don’t need, closes corporate tax loopholes that don’t help create jobs, and frees up resources for the things that do help us grow -- like education and infrastructure and research.  And these things historically have not been partisan.  And this shouldn’t be as difficult as it’s been in past years because we already spend less than we did a few years ago.  Our deficits are half of what they were a few years ago.  The debt problems we have now are long term, and we can address them without shortchanging our kids, or shortchanging our grandkids, or weakening the security that current generations have earned from their hard work.

So that’s number one.  Number two, we should finish fixing the job of -- let me say that again.  Number two, we should finish the job of fixing our broken immigration system. 

There's already a broad coalition across America that’s behind this effort of comprehensive immigration reform -- from business leaders to faith leaders to law enforcement.  In fact, the Senate has already passed a bill with strong bipartisan support that would make the biggest commitment to border security in our history; would modernize our legal immigration system; make sure everyone plays by the same rules, makes sure that folks who came here illegally have to pay a fine, pay back taxes, meet their responsibilities.  That bill has already passed the Senate. And economists estimate that if that bill becomes law, our economy would be 5 percent larger two decades from now.  That’s $1.4 trillion in new economic growth. 

The majority of Americans think this is the right thing to do.  And it's sitting there waiting for the House to pass it.  Now, if the House has ideas on how to improve the Senate bill, let's hear them.  Let's start the negotiations.  But let's not leave this problem to keep festering for another year, or two years, or three years.  This can and should get done by the end of this year. 

Number three, we should pass a farm bill, one that American farmers and ranchers can depend on; one that protects vulnerable children and adults in times of need; one that gives rural communities opportunities to grow and the long-term certainty that they deserve. 

Again, the Senate has already passed a solid bipartisan bill.  It's got support from Democrats and Republicans.  It's sitting in the House waiting for passage.  If House Republicans have ideas that they think would improve the farm bill, let's see them.  Let's negotiate.  What are we waiting for?  Let's get this done.

So, passing a budget; immigration reform; farm bill.  Those are three specific things that would make a huge difference in our economy right now.  And we could get them done by the end of the year if our focus is on what's good for the American people. And that’s just the big stuff.  There are all kinds of other things that we could be doing that don’t get as much attention. 

I understand we will not suddenly agree on everything now that the cloud of crisis has passed.  Democrats and Republicans are far apart on a lot of issues.  And I recognize there are folks on the other side who think that my policies are misguided -- that’s putting it mildly.  That’s okay.  That’s democracy.  That’s how it works.  We can debate those differences vigorously, passionately, in good faith, through the normal democratic process. 

And sometimes, we'll be just too far apart to forge an agreement.  But that should not hold back our efforts in areas where we do agree.  We shouldn’t fail to act on areas that we do agree or could agree just because we don’t think it's good politics; just because the extremes in our party don’t like the word “compromise.” 

I will look for willing partners wherever I can to get important work done.  And there's no good reason why we can't govern responsibly, despite our differences, without lurching from manufactured crisis to manufactured crisis.  In fact, one of the things that I hope all of us have learned these past few weeks is that it turns out smart, effective government is important.  It matters.  I think the American people during this shutdown had a chance to get some idea of all the things, large and small, that government does that make a difference in people's lives.

We hear all the time about how government is the problem.  Well, it turns out we rely on it in a whole lot of ways.  Not only does it keep us strong through our military and our law enforcement, it plays a vital role in caring for our seniors and our veterans, educating our kids, making sure our workers are trained for the jobs that are being created, arming our businesses with the best science and technology so they can compete with companies from other countries.  It plays a key role in keeping our food and our toys and our workplaces safe.  It helps folks rebuild after a storm.  It conserves our natural resources.  It finances startups.  It helps to sell our products overseas.  It provides security to our diplomats abroad. 

So let's work together to make government work better, instead of treating it like an enemy or purposely making it work worse.  That’s not what the founders of this nation envisioned when they gave us the gift of self-government.  You don’t like a particular policy or a particular president, then argue for your position.  Go out there and win an election.  Push to change it. But don’t break it.  Don’t break what our predecessors spent over two centuries building.  That's not being faithful to what this country is about.

And that brings me to one last point.  I’ve got a simple message for all the dedicated and patriotic federal workers who’ve either worked without pay or been forced off the job without pay these past few weeks, including most of my own staff: Thank you.  Thanks for your service.  Welcome back.  What you do is important.  It matters.

You defend our country overseas.  You deliver benefits to our troops who’ve earned them when they come home.  You guard our borders.  You protect our civil rights.  You help businesses grow and gain footholds in overseas markets.  You protect the air we breathe and the water our children drink.  And you push the boundaries of science and space, and you guide hundreds of thousands of people each day through the glories of this country. Thank you.  What you do is important.  And don't let anybody else tell you different.  Especially the young people who come to this city to serve -- believe that it matters.  Well, you know what, you’re right.  It does.

And those of us who have the privilege to serve this country have an obligation to do our job as best we can.  We come from different parties, but we are Americans first.  And that’s why disagreement cannot mean dysfunction.  It can't degenerate into hatred.  The American people’s hopes and dreams are what matters, not ours.  Our obligations are to them.  Our regard for them compels us all, Democrats and Republicans, to cooperate, and compromise, and act in the best interests of our nation –- one nation, under God, indivisible with liberty and justice for all.

Thanks very much.",President,Barack Obama,https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/the-press-office/2013/10/17/remarks-president-reopening-government,,DEVELOPMENT
China,15-11-2014 00:00,Xi Jinping,Promoting Innovative Development Achieving Interconnected Growth,"Prime Minister Tony Abbott,
Dear Colleagues,

As the premier forum for international economic cooperation, the G20 shoulders an important mission in promoting world economic stability and growth. In recent years, thanks to our concerted efforts, the world economy has bottomed out and continued to move in a positive direction. On the other hand, economic recovery still lacks momentum, risks remain in the financial market, and global trade continues to hover at a low level. The estimate of the relevant international organizations has put this year's growth of the world economy and international trade at 3.3% and 3. 1% respectively, both lower than the pre-crisis level.

A boat that sails against the current will be pushed backward if it does not move forward. For us, the immediate priority is to coordinate macroeconomic policies, overcome development challenges, reduce economic risks, and realize the goal of economic prosperity, financial stability. trade expansion, job creation and improved livelihood.

Just a few days ago, APEC introduced its plan for promoting growth in the Asia-Pacific region. I am pleased to note that the G20 is also making its own efforts which are of great significance. It has formulated the Comprehensive Growth Strategy and adopted the target of lifting GDP growth by 2% over the next five years above the trajectory implied by existing policies.

The key to implementing the Comprehensive Growth Strategy is to unleash and foster the driving forces for sustained growth, and promote innovative development, integrated interests and interconnected growth of all countries. In this connection, I suggest the G20 make efforts in the following three areas:

First,we should explore new ways to achieve growth. In our response to the international financial crisis, counter-cyclical stimulus policies were adopted to iron out volatility in the economy. Although such an approach produced visible short-term results, it failed to address the root cause of the problem. We must explore new thinking. policies and means of development, and pay more attention to the quality and efficiency of growth. In particular, we should carry out structural reform in fiscal policies, taxation, finance, investment, competition, trade and employment, and combine macroeconomic policies with social policies in order to generate momentum for wealth creation, release the power of the market, and push for a transition from cyclical recovery to sustainable growth.

We should also place high importance on the pulling effect of infrastructure on the economy. When hosting the APEC Economic Leaders' Meeting, China had made connectivity one of the key issues on the agenda in order to create new drivers of economic growth. We support the G20 in establishing a Global Infrastructure Hub and the .World Bank in setting up a Global Infrastructure Facility, and we will also contribute our share to global infrastructure investment through such means as the building of the Silk Road Economic Belt, the 21st Century Maritime Silk Road, the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank and the Silk Road Fund.

Second, we should build an open economy. Expansion in world trade benefits all countries, while a smaller world market is in no country's interest. We should continue to champion free trade, uphold the multilateral trading system, build a mutually-beneficial global value chain and foster a big global market. We should continue to oppose trade and investment protectionism, and push forward the Doha Round negotiations. We should make sure that various free trade agreements are open, inclusive, transparent and non-discriminatory, and prevent the global market from being carved up and avoid a fragmented trade system.

Third, we should improve global economic governance. This year marks the 70th anniversary of the Bretton Woods conference, which gives us an opportunity to take stock of the experience of the Bretton Woods system and further improve global economic governance. We should seize the opportunity to build a fair, equitable, inclusive and well-managed international financial system. increase the representation and voice of emerging markets and developing countries, and ensure equal rights, opportunities and rules for all countries in international economic cooperation. We should speed up the effective implementation of the IMF reform package, and strengthen the global financial safety net. The New Development Bank and Contingency Reserve Arrangement established by the BRICS countries and the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank initiated by over 20 Asian countries all make a positive complement to the international financial system.

Dear Colleagues,

China's economic growth is an important engine of the world economy. According to the estimate of the relevant international organization, China is one of the largest contributors to the G20's Comprehensive Growth Strategy, which is the result of the policy measures China has taken for the purpose of fostering steady growth, adjusting economic structure, advancing reform and improving people's livelihood. The growth strategy China has submitted to the G20 includes 134 such policy measures. fully demonstrating our resolve, thinking and action to promote growth through reform.

The Chinese economy will keep the momentum of strong, sustainable and balanced growth. Its annual growth is equivalent to the economic aggregate of a medium-sized developed country. Over the next five years, China will import US$10 trillion of goods and invest over US$500 billion overseas. This will lead to more demand in world economy and create more market, investment and growth opportunities. As the host of the G20 summit in 2016, China is ready to make even greater contribution to and play a bigger role in driving world economic growth.

Here, I wish to announce that China will subscribe to the IMF Special Data Dissemination Standard.

Dear Colleagues,

As the saying goes, if you want to walk fast, walk alone; if you want to walk far, walk together. In the face of the various risks and challenges of the world economy, the members of the G20 must foster a sense of community of shared interests and destiny, and stay as good friends and good partners. We should actively coordinate macroeconomic policies, and pursue win-win cooperation with the growth of one country supplementing and reinforcing the growth of another. Through these efforts, we will enable the G20 to walk steady and far to truly help stabilize the world economy. drive global growth and enhance global economic governance, bringing more benefits to the people of all countries.

Thank you.",President,Xi Jinping,https://www.fmprc.gov.cn/mfa_eng/wjdt_665385/zyjh_665391/t1225558.shtml,,INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS
USA,10-12-2021 00:00,Joe Biden,Remarks by President Biden at the Memorial Service of Senator Robert J. Dole,"THE PRESIDENT: Reverend, clergy, distinguished guests: Among the many memories from 50 years of friendship, there is one that especially captures what Bob Dole was as a man and, in my view, as a patriot.

We were on our way to the 50th anniversary of D-Day in Normandy, but we started in Italy, in Anzio. Much has been written about his time in Anzio, but to be there with him felt significantly different.

He was on a mission in the mountains. Nazi gunfire and mortar fire was thick. A man was dying — men were dying. Facing a hail of bullets, Second Lieutenant Robert Joseph Dole hurled a grenade into an empty [enemy] gun nest.

He was trying to help a fallen comrade, his platoon radioman, when everything changed. And I mean everything changed. His spine was damaged because fire tore across the hills, shattering his body. Grievously wounded. He was paralyzed.

Dragged behind a wall, Bob would pass in and out of consciousness, dreaming of home as he lay bleeding in the foxhole for nearly nine hours.

He was 21 years old.

Nearly eight decades on, we gather here in a world far different from the mountainous battlefield in 1949 — 45. But there’s something –- there’s something that connects that past and present, wartime and peace, then and now: the courage, the grit, the goodness, and the grace of a Second Lieutenant named Bob Dole, who became Congressman Dole, Senator Dole; a statesman, husband, father, friend, colleague, and a word that’s often overused but not here: a genuine hero — Bob Dole.

Dean and the clergy officiating today’s service; President Clinton; Vice President Harris, Vice President Pence, and Cheney, and Quayle; Speaker Pelosi; Leader Schumer; Leader McConnell; members of Congress of both parties past and present; members of the Cabinet; General Milley and leaders of our military; distinguished guests; and most of all, the Dole family — Elizabeth:

It’s been said that “memory is the power to gather roses in winter.” Bob left you with 45 years’ worth of roses, of a life built and a love shared that’s going to guide you through the difficult days ahead.

Jill and I will always be here for you, as many others in this church will be, as you and Bob were always there for us in ways nobody knows.

And, Robin, you carry your father’s pride, grace, and character. He’s always going to be with you, because as the old saying goes –- we Irish say, “You are your father’s daughter.” You are your father’s daughter.”

Bob Dole’s story is a very American one. Born and raised in a three-room house through the Dust Bowl and the Great Depression. Shipped out as a young man to World War Two. Wounded in battle on the same weekend that Franklin Delano Roosevelt was being mourned by millions. Bob came home, rebuilt his life, painful hour by painful day by painful week by painful month by painful year. Hearing he and Danny Inouye, who was wounded on a mountain not far from where he was, talk about the recovery they spent together for all those, literally, several years — it was astounding.

God, what courage Bob Dole had.

He then went to school on the GI Bill; came to Washington with the New Frontier; bravely voted for civil rights and voting rights in the years of the Kennedys, Lyndon Johnson, and Martin Luther King, Jr. Ran for President on the ticket with Gerald Ford.

And through the ages of Nixon, Carter, Reagan, Bush the elder, and Clinton, Bob was literally the master of the Senate. We served together for 25 years. We disagreed, but we were never disagreeable with one another, not one time that I can think of.

I found Bob to be a man of principle, pragmatism, and enormous integrity. He came into the arena with certain guiding principles that began with devotion to country, to fair play, to decency, to dignity, to honor, to literally attempting to find the common good. That’s how he worked with George McGovern to fight hunger in America, particularly as it affected children, and around the world.

He worked with Teddy Kennedy and Tom Harkin to bring down the barriers of Americans living with disabilities –- a profound change and profound act of grace.

He worked with Daniel Patrick Moynihan to literally save Social Security because Bob believed every American deserved
to grow old with their basic dignity -– basic dignity intact.

And over the opposition of many in his own party and some in mine, he managed the bill that created the federal holiday in the name of Martin Luther King, Jr. Bob Dole –- Bob Dole did that.

He never forgot where he came from. And I never forgot what he said to our colleagues about the effort for the King holiday. And I’ll quote — he said, “No first-class democracy can treat people like second-class citizens.” “No first-class democracy can treat people like second-class citizens.”

Bob didn’t hate government. He knew the people who needed him most are the people most in need. He wanted government to work — to work for folks like him who came up the hard way. “Just give everybody a chance, Joe. Just a chance.”

During the Depression, Bob’s parents moved into the basement of their three-room –- not three-bedroom –- their three-room home in Russell, Kansas, so they could rent out, quote, “the upstairs.”

Bob understood hardship. He had known hardship, and he never -– never forgot it. He never forgot the people as well who sent him to Washington — people from Russell and from Kansas.

Bob was a man who always did his duty, who lived by a code of honor. Almost seems strange to say that today, but he lived by a code of honor, and he meant it.

Just as his colleagues, Republican and Democrat, looked at him, I think they saw him the same way I did. Just ask any who served with him at the time.

Bob Dole fit my dad’s description. He said, “You must be a man of your word. Without your word, you’re not a man.” And Bob Dole was a man of his word.

He loved his country, which he served his whole life. The Bible tells us: To whom much is given, much is expected.

And Bob Dole, for all his hardship, believed he’d been given the greatest gift of all: He was an American. He was an American. And he felt it.

Let’s be honest. Bob Dole was always honest — sometimes to a fault. (Laughs.) He once endured the wrath of his fellow Republicans when there was a legitimate fight going on to defund Amtrak.

Now, I’ve traveled over 1,200,000 miles on Amtrak because I commuted every single day. It came time for, literally, the deciding vote — the deciding vote on whether we’re going to defund Amtrak. And he cast the vote against his party, deciding to keep funding Amtrak. And, obviously, you might guess, he was asked why. “Why would you do that?” He said, “It’s the best way to get Joe Biden the hell out of here at night so he’s not here in the morning.” (Laughter.) Excuse my language. (Laughter.) True story. Absolutely true story. God, I loved the guy.

As I said, he was always honest.

But Bob relished a good political fight, as much as anybody I’ve ever served with in the 36 years I was in the Senate. And Bob gave as good or better than he got.

He was a proud Republican. He chaired his party. He led its caucus in the United States Senate. And he bore the banner as its nominee for Vice President and President of the United States.

He could be partisan, and that was fine. Americans have been partisan since Jefferson and Hamilton squared off in George Washington’s cabinet.

But like them, Bob Dole was a patriot. He was a patriot. And here’s what his patriotism teaches us, in my view, as Bob Dole himself wrote at the end of his life — and I quote him: “I cannot pretend that I have not been a loyal champion of my party, but I always served my country best when I did so first and foremost as an American.” End of quote. “First and foremost as an American.”

That was Bob Dole. Liddy, that was your husband; that was your dad. Always as an American.

He understood that we’re all part of something bigger than ourselves — and he really did, I felt; he really understood it — and that “compromise” isn’t a dirty word, it’s the cornerstone of our democracy.

Consensus is required in a democracy to get anything done. That’s how you get things done. Again, listen to Bob Dole’s words, not mine. I’m quoting him again: “I learned that it is difficult to get anything done unless you can compromise — not your principles, but your willingness to see the other side. Those who suggest [that] compromise is a sign of weakness misunderstand the fundamental strength of…democracy.” End of quote.

In his final days, Bob made it clear that he was deeply concerned about the threat to American democracy, not from foreign nations but from the divisions tearing us apart from within.

And this soldier reminded us, and I quote, “Too many of us have sacrificed too much in defending that freedom from foreign adversaries to allow our democracy to crumble” in a state — “under a state of infighting that grows more unacceptable” day by day. Grows more unacceptable day by day. He wrote this when he knew his days were numbered — in small numbers.

My fellow Americans, taps is now sounding for this soldier of America — forged in war, tested by adversity.

Taps is now sounding for this patriot driven by a sense of mission to give back to the land that gave him everything to him for which he nearly gave his all.

Taps is now sounding for this giant of our time and of all time. We’re bidding this great American farewell.

But we know as long as we keep his spirit alive; as long as we see each other not as enemies, but as neighbors and colleagues; as long as we remember that we’re here not to tear down, but to build up; as long as we remember that, then taps will never sound for Bob Dole.

For Bob will be with us always, cracking a joke, moving a bill, finding common ground.

In his final message to the nation, Bob said that whenever he started a new journey — whenever he started a new journey, the first thing he would do, and I quote, is “sit back and watch for a few days,” then start standing up for what he thought was right. End of quote.

Bob Dole has taken his final journey. He’s sitting back now, watching us. Now it’s our job to start standing up for what’s right for America.

I salute you, my friend. Your nation salutes you.

And I believe the words of the poet R.G. Ingersoll, when he described heroism, better fit you than anyone I know. And Ingersoll wrote the following: “When the will defies fear, when duty throws the gauntlet down to fate, when honor scorns to compromise with death, that is heroism.”

May flights of angels thi- — sing thee to thy rest, Bob. God bless Bob Dole. God bless America. And may God protect our troops.",President,Joe Biden,https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/speeches-remarks/2021/12/10/remarks-by-president-biden-at-the-memorial-service-of-senator-robert-j-dole/,,OTHERS
USA,03-01-2020 00:00,Donald Trump,Remarks by President Trump on the Killing of Qasem Soleimani,"THE PRESIDENT:  Hello, everybody.  Well, thank you very much.  And good afternoon.

As President, my highest and most solemn duty is the defense of our nation and its citizens.

Last night, at my direction, the United States military successfully executed a flawless precision strike that killed the number-one terrorist anywhere in the world, Qasem Soleimani.

Soleimani was plotting imminent and sinister attacks on American diplomats and military personnel, but we caught him in the act and terminated him.

Under my leadership, America’s policy is unambiguous: To terrorists who harm or intend to harm any American, we will find you; we will eliminate you.  We will always protect our diplomats, service members, all Americans, and our allies.

For years, the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps and its ruthless Quds Force — under Soleimani’s leadership — has targeted, injured, and murdered hundreds of American civilians and servicemen.

The recent attacks on U.S. targets in Iraq, including rocket strikes that killed an American and injured four American servicemen very badly, as well as a violent assault on our embassy in Baghdad, were carried out at the direction of Soleimani.

Soleimani made the death of innocent people his sick passion, contributing to terrorist plots as far away as New Delhi and London.

Today we remember and honor the victims of Soleimani’s many atrocities, and we take comfort in knowing that his reign of terror is over.

Soleimani has been perpetrating acts of terror to destabilize the Middle East for the last 20 years.  What the United States did yesterday should have been done long ago.  A lot of lives would have been saved.

Just recently, Soleimani led the brutal repression of protestors in Iran, where more than a thousand innocent civilians were tortured and killed by their own government.

We took action last night to stop a war.  We did not take action to start a war.

I have deep respect for the Iranian people.  They are a remarkable people, with an incredible heritage and unlimited potential.  We do not seek regime change.  However, the Iranian regime’s aggression in the region, including the use of proxy fighters to destabilize its neighbors, must end, and it must end now.

The future belongs to the people of Iran — those who seek peaceful coexistence and cooperation — not the terrorist warlords who plunder their nation to finance bloodshed abroad.

The United States has the best military by far, anywhere in the world.  We have best intelligence in the world.  If Americans anywhere are threatened, we have all of those targets already fully identified, and I am ready and prepared to take whatever action is necessary.  And that, in particular, refers to Iran.

Under my leadership, we have destroyed the ISIS territorial caliphate, and recently, American Special Operations Forces killed the terrorist leader known as al-Baghdadi.  The world is a safer place without these monsters.

America will always pursue the interests of good people, great people, great souls, while seeking peace, harmony, and friendship with all of the nations of the world.

Thank you.  God bless you.  God bless our great military.  And God bless the United States of America.  Thank you very much.  Thank you.",President,Donald Trump,https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefings-statements/remarks-president-trump-killing-qasem-soleimani/,,INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS
Russia,10-01-2008 00:00,Dmitry Medvedev,Speech at State Decorations Presentation Ceremony,"Dear comrades,

We have gathered here at the Kremlin to honour Russian servicepersons who showed courage and heroism during the tragic events in South Ossetia, and to remember the feats of those who gave their lives.

When the regular Georgian army, equipped with the latest foreign arms, unleashed a hail of fire on Tskhinvali, Russian soldiers and officers did not flinch and rose up to stop the aggressor. There were literally only minutes in which to act. The slightest delay could have led to even more deaths. You defended the lives of our citizens, protected Russia’s dignity and showed your best professional and personal qualities.

I repeat once again that our actions were absolutely lawful and complied in full with international law and our peacekeeping obligations. I stress this point – unlike the regime in Tbilisi, which overturned all past agreements in an instant and brought the region to the brink of catastrophe.

Our public and our army shared common trials and common goals during those difficult days. Before the events of August 8, few could have believed it possible that a full-scale military adventure would be unleashed before the world very eyes, with the objective of wiping out an entire people.

Something else has become clear today: a world where peacekeepers are shot at, where the regular army carries out ethnic cleansing, where criminal regimes can obtain protection and information about the real state of affairs is constantly blocked is an absolutely unreliable world. It is clear that the existing collective security mechanism has broken down, and therefore, alongside our political efforts on the international stage, we will also strengthen our country’s defence capability. It is our duty to provide reliable protection to Russia’s democracy, sovereignty, and our citizens’ right to a peaceful life.

Dear friends, almost two months have passed now since the war in South Ossetia, but the consequences will make themselves felt for a long time yet and the spiritual wounds of the people who lived through these terrible events will be a long time healing.

We have helped and will continue to help the Ossetian people rebuild and do everything possible to ensure stable peace for these two new states, South Ossetia and Abkhazia. This is our duty and we will never forget those who gave their lives to save peaceful people.

Here today are officers and soldiers who were at the epicentre of the aggression. I thank you for your faultless performance of your military duties and for the courage and professionalism you showed in carrying out your mission. Each of you was able to mobilise your experience, knowledge and strength and take the competent action needed to make the peacekeeping mission a success. Of course, I would like to say something about everyone present here today in my speech, but I will start by naming those who have been awarded the title of Hero of Russia.

The Hero of the Russian Federation Gold Star is awarded to tank company commander Captain Yury Pavlovich Yakovlev and tank commander Sergeant Sergei Andreyevich Mylnikov. In a fierce battle they attacked the Georgian forces’ battle orders and destroyed weapons depots and several enemy armoured vehicles. The title of Hero of Russia is awarded to Lieutenant-Colonel Konstantin Anatolyevich Timerman. Even though wounded, he remained on the battlefield and continued to fight against an enemy force superior in numbers. Konstantin Anatolyevich was only recently discharged from hospital and we wish him a speedy recovery.

The Hero of Russia Gold Star is awarded to Colonel Gennady Vladimirovich Anashkin and Lieutenant-Colonel Andrei Leonidovich Krasov for their brave and decisive action during the peacekeeping operations.

Also with us today is paratroops special-forces officer and Hero of the Russian Federation Anatoly Vasilyevich Lebed. He was at the knife-edge of the attack during the operations and showed unfailing personal courage. Lieutenant-Colonel Lebed is awarded the Order of St. George IV class.

The Medal ‘For Courage’ is awarded to medical instructors with the peacekeeping battalion Sergeant Zukhra Mukhanbievna Tramova and Junior Sergeant Maya Grigorievna Bestayeva. These truly heroic women helped the wounded under a hail of fire right at the combat position. Their skilled action saved dozens of human lives.

Dear comrades, I have named only a few names, but Russia is deservedly proud of every one of you who is receiving a decoration today.

Once again, I congratulate you on your high decorations, and I wish you good health, success in your service and prosperity for your families. Thank you for your service to Russia.

*****

Dmitry Medvedev: Dear comrades, dear friends,

I want to thank you sincerely once more for your service and for everything you did at this difficult moment for our country.

It is very clear that almost two months ago our country faced the choice of doing nothing and closing its eyes to gross violations of international obligations and the deaths of our people, including our peacekeepers, or taking resolute action to stop the aggression. We chose the latter and we were right. It was at this moment that we showed that Russia is a country that can stand up for its citizens and that other countries will have to take into account, including countries that hide behind friendship with other stronger powers. We will not tolerate arbitrariness. If need be, we will use different means to protect our interests. Our emphasis is on political means, of course, political negotiations, and this reflects our peaceful foreign policy. But we cannot close our eyes to what is happening.

One more point I want to make: the world changed after August this year. We have witnessed the collapse of the old world order and we are now seeing the emergence of a new and we hope safer and fairer world order. Russia’s actions in August this year to save the people of South Ossetia and protect our citizens and our country’s interests are evidence of this.

It is my great pleasure to thank you for what you have done, because were it not for your sense of duty and your service at this difficult hour, history could have taken a different turn. We are proud of you!

Thank you for your service. We are counting on you! ",President,Dmitry Medvedev,http://en.kremlin.ru/events/president/transcripts/statements/1570,,OTHERS

Remarks by the President on Veterans Day","Thank you.  (Applause.)  Thank you so much.  Thank you.  (Applause.)  Thank you very much.  Thank you so much.  (Applause.)  Thank you.  Thank you very much.  (Applause.)  Please -- thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  (Applause.) 

Secretary McDonald, Mr. Hallinan, distinguished guests and, most of all, our extraordinary veterans and your families:  The last time I stood on these hallowed grounds, on Memorial Day, our country came together to honor those who have fought and died for our flag.  A few days before, our nation observed Armed Forces Day, honoring all who are serving under that flag at this moment.

And today, on Veterans Day, we honor those who honored our country with its highest form of service:  You who once wore the uniform of our Army, Navy, Air Force, Marines, or Coast Guard.  We owe you our thanks.  We owe you our respect.  And we owe you our freedom.

We come together to express our profound gratitude for the sacrifices and contributions you and your family made on the battlefield, at home, and at outposts around the world.  But America’s gratitude to our veterans is something always grounded in something greater than what you did on duty.  It's also an appreciation of the example that you continue to set after your service has ended -- your example as citizens.

Veterans Day often follows a hard-fought political campaign -- an exercise in the free speech and self-government that you fought for.  It often lays bare disagreements across our nation.  But the American instinct has never been to find isolation in opposite corners.  It is to find strength in our common creed, to forge unity from our great diversity, to sustain that strength and unity even when it is hard.  And when the election is over, as we search for ways to come together -- to reconnect with one another and with the principles that are more enduring than transitory politics -- some of our best examples are the men and women we salute on Veterans Day.

It's the example of young Americans -- our 9/11 Generation -- who, as first responders ran into smoldering towers, then ran to a recruiting center and signed up to serve.

It's the example of a military that meets every mission, one united team, all looking out for one another, all getting each other’s backs.

It's the example of the single-most diverse institution in our country -- soldiers, sailors, airmen, Marines, and coastguardsmen who represent every corner of our country, every shade of humanity, immigrant and native-born, Christian, Muslim, Jew, and nonbeliever alike, all forged into common service.

It's the example of veterans -- patriots -- who, when they take off their fatigues, put back on the camouflage of everyday life in America and become our business partners and bosses, our teachers and our coaches, our first responders, city council members, community leaders, role models -- all still serving this country we love with the same sense of duty and with valor. 

A few years ago, a middle-school student from Missouri entered an essay contest about why veterans are special.  This is what he wrote:  “When I think of a veteran, I think of men or women who will be the first to help an elderly lady across the street.  I also think of someone who will defend everyone, regardless of their race, age, gender, hair color, or other discriminations.” 

After eight years in office, I particularly appreciate that he included hair color.  (Laughter.)  But that middle-schooler is right.  Our veterans are still the first to help; still the first to serve. 

They are women like the retired military policewoman from Buffalo who founded an AMVETS post in her community and is now building a safe place for homeless female veterans with children.  (Applause.)

They are men like the two veterans from Tennessee -- one in his fifties, one in his sixties -- who wrote me to say they would happily suit up and ship out if we needed them.  “We might be just a little old,” they wrote, “but we will be proud to go and do what we were taught to do.”

Whenever the world makes you cynical; whenever you seek true humility and true selflessness, look to a veteran.

Look to someone like First Lieutenant Irving Lerner.  Irving was born in Chicago to Russian Jewish immigrants during World War I.  He served as a bombardier in the Army Air Corps, flying dozens of missions toward the end of World War II.

When he returned home, Irving did what a lot of veterans do -- he put away his medals, he kept humble about his service, started living a quiet life.  One fall day, walking down Sheffield Avenue on Chicago’s North Side, a stranger stopped him.  He said, “Thank you for your service” -- and he handed him a ticket to see the Cubs play in the World Series.  (Applause.)  Now, it’s a good thing Irving took that ticket -- (laughter) -- because it would be a while until his next chance.  (Laughter.)

Irving worked hard, managing the warehouse for his brother-in-law’s tire company.  He got married -- to a sergeant in the Women’s Air Corps, no less.  He raised four children -- the oldest of whom, Susan, is celebrating her 71st birthday today.  And on a June morning many years ago, another one of Irving’s daughters, Carole, called to check in.  Her mother answered but was in a rush.  “We can’t talk,” she said, “your father is being honored and we’re late.”  Carole asked, “Honored for what?”  And the answer came:  for his heroism in the skies above Normandy exactly 50 years earlier. 

You see, Irving’s children never knew that their father flew over those French beachheads on D-Day.  He never mentioned it.  Now when they call to check in, his children always say, “Thank you for saving the world.”  And Irving, sharp as ever at 100 years young, always replies, “Well, I had a little help.”  (Laughter.)

Whenever the world makes you cynical, whenever you doubt that courage and goodness and selflessness is possible, stop and look to a veteran.  They don’t always go around telling stories of their heroism, so it's up to us to ask and to listen, to tell those stories for them, and to live in our own lives the values for which they were prepared to give theirs. 

It's up to us to make sure they always get the care that they need.  As Bob mentioned, when I announced my candidacy for this office almost a decade ago, I recommitted this generation to that work.  And we’ve increased funding for veterans by more than 85 percent.  We’ve cut veteran homelessness almost in half.  Today, more veterans have access to health care and fewer are unemployed.  (Applause.)  We helped disabled veterans afford prosthetics.  We’re delivering more mental health care services to more veterans than ever before because we know that not all wounds of war are visible.

Together, we began this work.  Together, we must continue to keep that sacred trust with our veterans and honor their good work with our own, knowing that our mission is never done.  It is still a tragedy that 20 veterans a day take their own lives.  We have to get them the help they need.  We have to keep solving problems like long wait times at the VA.  We have to keep cutting the disability claims backlog.  We have to resist any effort to outsource and privatize the health care we owe America’s veterans.  (Applause.)

On Veterans Day, we acknowledge, humbly, that we can never serve our veterans in quite the same that they served us.  But we can try.  We can practice kindness.  We can pay it forward.  We can volunteer.  We can serve.  We can respect one another.  We can always get each other’s backs.

That is what Veterans Day asks all of us to think about.  The person you pass as you walk down the street might not be wearing our nation’s uniform today.  But consider for a moment that a year or a decade or a generation ago, he or she might have been one of our fellow citizens who was willing to lay down their life for strangers like us.  And we can show how much we love our country by loving our neighbors as ourselves.

May God bless all who served and still do.  And may God bless the United States of America.  (Applause.)",President,Barack Obama,https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/the-press-office/2016/11/11/remarks-president-veterans-day,,OTHERS
USA,15-11-2014,Barack Obama,"
Weekly Address: Open Enrollment Starts Today"," Hi, everybody.  Over the past year, more than 10 million Americans have gained the financial security and peace of mind that comes with health insurance. 

More than seven million people enrolled in affordable coverage by visiting HealthCare.gov, or going to the marketplace in their state.  On average, they’re paying just $82 a month for coverage.  For a lot of people, that’s less than a cell phone bill or a cable bill.  Insurance companies can no longer deny you coverage just because you have a preexisting condition, and they now have to cover free preventive care like checkups and mammograms. 

If you missed your chance to get covered last year, here’s the good news.  Starting November 15th, today, you can go online or call 1-800-318-2596 and get covered for 2015.  And we’ve spent the last year improving and upgrading HealthCare.gov, to make it faster and easier to use. 

If you already buy insurance through the online marketplace, now is the time to take a look at some new options for next year.  You might be able to save more money, or find a plan that fits your family’s needs even better than the one you’ve got now.  If you haven’t signed up for insurance yet, this is your chance.  Odds are, you’ll qualify for tax credits to help you afford it. 

But this window won’t stay open forever.  You only have three months to shop for plans, so it’s worth starting right away.  And it might make a big difference for your family’s bottom line.

Last year, I got an email from a woman named Amy Williams, in Augusta, Georgia.  She and her husband are self-employed in the trucking business.  For years, they paid about $1,200 a month for their health insurance.  Then they checked out HealthCare.gov.  They found a plan with coverage they liked, and it was way less expensive.  She says that they’ve saved around $13,000 on their premiums this year alone. 

Stories like Amy’s are why we fought so hard to pass the Affordable Care Act.  To help more families breathe a little easier.  In part because this law is working, health care prices have grown at their slowest rate in nearly 50 years.  And this year, insurance premiums for families who are covered through an employer grew at a rate tied for the lowest on record. 

So spread the word.  Tell your friends and family members to get covered.  Talk to folks in your church or your classroom.  Tell them to take a few minutes to check out Healthcare.gov, CuidadoDeSalud.gov, or call 1-800-318-2596 – it can make a big difference in their lives.  Let them know that it’s easy, it’s affordable, and that they have just three months, starting today, November 15th, to sign up.  Together, we can make sure that even more of America gets covered in the year ahead.

Thanks, and have a great weekend. ",President,Barack Obama,https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/the-press-office/2014/11/15/weekly-address-open-enrollment-starts-today,,DEVELOPMENT
Russia,14-06-2019,Vladimir Putin,Speech at the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation Heads of State Council Meeting in expanded format,"Mr President of Kyrgyzstan, colleagues,

I certainly agree with the positive assessments of the activities of our organisation, the SCO, which have just been voiced here. The SCO is indeed successfully developing and strengthening its positions in regional affairs, making a significant contribution to ensuring peace, security and stability in Eurasia.

Given that at the end of today's meeting, Russia will take over the Presidency of the SCO, I would like to outline Russia’s vision of the most promising areas of the organisation’s work in 2019–2020.

We believe that the fight against terrorism and extremism remains among our top priorities. We consider it important to increase cooperation within the SCO’s Regional Anti-Terrorist Structure, to cut off the financial support of terrorism through drug trafficking, and to make every effort to prevent terrorists laying their hands on chemical, biological or other weapons of mass destruction.

Russia also advocates close cooperation with the SCO member states in curbing the propaganda of terrorist and extremist ideas on the internet and the use of information and communication technologies for criminal purposes. The Concept of Cooperation of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation Member States in Digitalisation and Information and Communication Technology, which we are approving today, is aimed at strengthening cooperation in this area.

Over the period of Russia’s Presidency, the SCO will certainly face a great deal of work to settle crises and peacefully resolve conflicts seated near the external borders of our states.

The developments in Afghanistan require special attention; my colleagues have already spoken about this here. The Afghan people need help in achieving national reconciliation and economic recovery.

We fully support the plan to expand the organisation’s security, economic and humanitarian cooperation with Afghanistan, as reflected in the relevant roadmap to be signed today. We aim to contribute in every way to the revival of the SCO-Afghanistan Contact Group’s activity.

Real results in the fight against international terrorism have been achieved in Syria. The militants have been defeated there largely due to Russia’s comprehensive assistance to the legitimate Syrian government. Damascus has regained control over most of the country’s territory. The political reconciliation process is progressing, and work is underway to set up the Constitutional Committee.

Our immediate task now is to ensure the complete elimination of hotbeds of terrorism that remain in Syria, primarily in Idlib, and at the same time to increase the volume of humanitarian aid and assistance to the economic reconstruction of Syria provided by the international community.

The Iranian nuclear programme still raises concerns. The US withdrawal from the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action – as a reminder, it was unanimously approved by the UN Security Council in 2015 – is not only destabilising the region, but also can undermine the nuclear non-proliferation regime.

While presiding in the SCO, we intend to work to ensure that the parties to the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action fulfil their obligations. We consider this to be the only logical and correct path.

Colleagues,

We also plan to focus on deepening the mutually beneficial economic ties between the SCO member states. In this context, we propose considering new promising projects in trade, industry, energy, infrastructure, science and technology, and innovation. The SCO Business Council and the SCO Interbank Consortium could play an important role in this work.

The expansion of mutually beneficial inter-regional trade, investment and humanitarian contacts within the SCO will certainly contribute to the development of the SCO Heads of Regions Forum, a new mechanism within the organisation. It was established at Russia’s initiative, and we propose holding the first meeting early next year.

We will continue to interact with our colleagues in the SCO to combine the integration processes being developed in Eurasia, harmonise national development strategies and regional multilateral economic projects.

We see a promising potential in integrating the Eurasian Economic Union with China’s Belt and Road project with a future aim of building a larger Eurasian partnership and an open and equal constructive cooperation space based on the principles and norms of international law without any political or economic bias, but with consideration of each other’s legitimate interests.

During Russia’s Presidency of the SCO, we will certainly pay particular attention to deepening cultural and humanitarian ties, which our colleagues have just talked about here too. In particular, we will focus on the implementation of cooperation agreements reached in the fields of media, physical fitness, sports and tourism. I fully agree with that.

Next year marks the 75th anniversary of Victory over Nazism in the Second World War. We in Russia attach great importance to preserving the memory and historical truth about this great and tragic event of the 20th century.

We are planning, also with our partners in the Commonwealth of Independent States, to organise an ambitious programme of celebrations and invite all the states represented here to take part in this work. The SCO Youth Council could also join the organising activities, which I think will be extremely beneficial for young people.

Colleagues, we will be delighted to see you at these events, including the Victory Day celebrations in Moscow.

Colleagues,

In conclusion, I would like to congratulate Kyrgyzstan on successfully completing its Presidency of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation and say that the Russian Presidency will ensure continuity in the organisation’s work.

We invite you to the next meeting of the SCO Council of Heads of State on July 22–23, 2020 in Russia.

Thank you for your attention.

USA,30-06-2021 00:00,Joe Biden,Remarks by President Biden Signing Three Congressional Review Act Bills into Law: S.J.Res.13; S.J.Res.14; and S.J.Res.15,"THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you.  (Applause.)  Madam Speaker, welcome to almost the other side.  (Laughter.)  It’s great to see you guys.  And it’s strange to have congressmen stand up for me; that’s an unusual thing to do.  But thank you so much.
 
Well, welcome to the adjunct to the White House here.  The — I’m about to sign into law three bills which you all have written and passed protecting our planet from climate-disturbing greenhouse gas, particularly methane, which is devastating; protecting consumers from predatory lenders; and protecting workers from employment discrimination. 
 
Each of these bills — each of these bills reflects a return to common sense and commitment to the common good, and I want to thank every one of you for your leadership in getting this done.
 
The first bill is going to help us to drastically cut methane pollution.  You may remember — and I know you all do, but to say this for the press and those listening — back — back when President Obama, in 2016, and I put in place a rule that required that companies capture methane leaks from the wells they were digging. 
 
Well, guess what?  They didn’t.  And so, since then, we’ve learned that methane is even more dangerous to the climate than we knew back then, in 2016 — trapping much more heat — up to 80 times more heat, methane does — and carbon — than carbon dioxide in its first 20 years in the atmosphere.
 
And, look, this is an important first step of cutting methane pollution.  Our bipartisan infrastructure plan will include $21 billion in environmental remediation to capping millions of abandoned wells, leaking wells, and oil and gas wells.  And so, it will be a good step forward.
 
The second bill will protect borrowers against predatory lenders.  In many states, these lenders are kept in check by caps on how much interest they can charge, but some loan sharks and online lenders have figured out how to get around these limits and — by using a partnership with a bank to avoid the state cap and charging outrageous interest.  And I’m — you all have pointed out — some as high as 100 percent interest, which is astounding.  And I must admit to you, I didn’t know that.  I was unaware they could pull that off. 
 
These are so called “rent-a-bank” schemes.  And they allow lenders to prey on veterans, seniors, and other unsuspecting borrowers tapping in the — trapping them into a cycle of debt.  And the last administration let it happened, but we won’t.
 
And the third bill is going to help us hold employers accountable for workplace discrimination.  As a nation, we continue to strive toward realizing our founding principle that all people are created equal and have a right to full access to the American Dream, and that includes at work — at work.  That’s why we have the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, which enforces the law that makes job discrimination illegal. 
 
The last administration put in place a rule that makes it harder — makes it harder for those seeking redress for job discrimination to get justice.  With this law, we’re going to move in the direction of greater accountability, fairness, and justice.",President,Joe Biden,https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/speeches-remarks/2021/06/30/remarks-by-president-biden-signing-three-congressional-review-act-bills-into-law-s-j-res-13-s-j-res-14-and-s-j-res-15/,,OTHERS
Russia,14-10-2017,Vladimir Putin,Opening of Inter-Parliamentary Union Assembly,"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, friends,
I am sincerely glad to welcome you to Russia. We are greatly honoured to host the Assembly of the Inter-Parliamentary Union – the oldest international parliamentary organisation – here in Russia, at our home.
I would like to stress that this forum gathered the biggest number of people in the Union’s 128-year history: more than 160 delegations, with 96 speakers among them, and 2,400 participants.
The agenda is very rich as well. You will discuss such relevant topics as protection of human rights and freedoms, the fight against terrorism, sustainable global development, and the role of women and young people in politics and economy. I am aware that the work has already started, in fact.
It is symbolic that your meeting takes place in St Petersburg. It was here, in this city, that the first Russian parliament – the State Duma – started its work at the beginning of last century; where parliamentary traditions, law-making practice and parliamentary culture were formed.
This legacy, historical lessons are important for us today too as well as the experience of our foreign colleagues in law-making, party building, your experience, ladies and gentlemen, friends.
In contemporary Russia, the parliament’s high status and key powers are stipulated in the fundamental law – the Constitution, which will mark its 25th anniversary next year. At the same time, we will gradually move towards developing democratic, representative institutions of power and enhancing the legislative branch’s authority and importance.
Friends, all over the world, parliaments express the will of the people and in doing so play a landmark, substantial, sometimes a leading role in devising national development models and, of course, in searching for efficient answers to modern challenges and threats that are common to all of us.
I believe one of such threats is the erosion of the system of international law and the culture of inter-state dialogue. Unfortunately, this is true, this is today’s practice. Like nobody else, you know the value of the law, dialogue and free discussion, as these are the fundamentals of parliamentary work.
This is why, against the current backdrop, parliamentary diplomacy is in such high demand, as it can consolidate trust between states and nations and help find compromise solutions to pressing international and regional problems. 
Unfortunately, we are seeing increasingly active attempts to limit direct contacts and communication among law-makers. I am referring to the practice of imposing discriminatory limitations and sanctions, often extending to parliamentarians as well.
We consider such practice unacceptable, harmful and misguided. It is even more counter-productive when rights of entire delegations are infringed upon as part of inter-parliamentary institutions – this happens, unfortunately, too.
In our opinion, this contradicts the principle of free inter-parliamentary cooperation, the sovereign right of each state to express and stand for its point of view in a civilised and open manner.
There are no and can be no unified, template development models in the modern world. Each state has a natural and undisputable right to shape its destiny as stipulated in the UN Charter. Attempts to interfere in the lives of sovereign countries, without understanding or taking into account their national specifics, brings nothing but chaos.
Such ill-considered external interference resulted in the destabilisation of the situation in the Middle East and North Africa, escalation of tensions in this region, and growth of the terrorist threat. 
We are convinced that terrorism should be fought without double standards, without hidden agendas, without using radicals in anyone else’s political interests, and of course this should be done only by joining efforts, only in cooperation. Russia has repeatedly urged others to create a wide international coalition to this end and still believes that building a real partnership to fight terror is critically important.
You are aware of the efforts our country undertakes to stabilise the military and political situation in Syria. In two years, the area under the control of terrorists has halved, a number of large cities have been liberated, and substantial damage has been dealt to terrorists’ infrastructure.
I would like to stress: in Syria, we act in coordination with the country’s government and strictly in compliance with international law.
Recently, agreements were concluded in the Astana format in Kazakhstan creating four de-escalation zones in Syria. These agreements were reached with the participation of guarantor countries – Russia, Iran and Turkey and with the support of very many other states.
These agreements lay the groundwork for implementing UN Security Council Resolution 2254 based on a direct dialogue between the government and the opposition, uniting their efforts in the interest of the quickest possible eradication of this hotbed of terrorism, and establishment of peace and preservation of Syria’s unity.
I believe it is time for the international community to think about post-war restoration of the state. In what forms and volumes must aid be rendered to this and other countries in the region, how can we contribute to their socioeconomic development more efficiently, to the consolidation of state institutions, including the legislative branch.
I am sure you will agree that such tasks are worth being discussed at the parliamentary and inter-parliamentary levels. 
Colleagues, it is in our shared interest to promote a peaceful, creative and balanced agenda, to aspire to reduce strife, prevent the emergence of new separating lines, including ethnic and religious ones, jointly move towards shaping a more just and solid architecture of international relations.
I am convinced that the overwhelming majority of parliamentarians share this approach.
I wish success and all the best to the Inter-Parliamentary Union and its participants.
Thank you for your attention, ladies and gentlemen. I declare the Assembly’s 137th session open.

USA,12-11-2021 00:00,Joe Biden,"A Proclamation on America Recycles Day, 2021","In recent months, I have traveled across the country to see firsthand the devastating toll of climate change.  I have walked down streets in Louisiana, New Jersey, and New York where deadly storms and floods have destroyed the lives of working families, wiping homes and businesses off the map.  I have sat with firefighters in Boise, Idaho, and surveyed damage from the Caldor Fire in northern California — just one large wildfire among dozens that together have burned more acres of American land this year than make up the State of New Jersey.  Communities encompassing the homes of more than 100 million people — about 1 in 3 Americans — have been struck by extreme weather events in the last few months alone.  Climate change is a blinking code red for our Nation.

This crisis poses an existential threat, but we also know that it is within our power to defeat it.  Today, half of all global greenhouse gas emissions are created when natural resources are taken from the Earth and made into usable products.  By reducing, reusing, and recycling, we can decrease waste and the greenhouse gases that fuel the climate crisis while protecting our communities and our environment.  On America Recycles Day, we celebrate efforts across the country to manage our resources responsibly and creatively, and we recommit ourselves to building a brighter and more sustainable future for all people. 

Although we have made significant progress since the first America Recycles Day over 2 decades ago, we still have work to do.  Black, Brown, Indigenous, and low-income communities continue to be disproportionately impacted by higher pollution levels as well as detrimental health and environmental impacts from mismanaged waste.  Our Nation’s infrastructure has not kept pace with today’s changing waste stream, and markets for recycled materials are decreasing.  To improve our national recycling system and manage our precious resources equitably and sustainably, it is going to take all of us — including Federal, State, Tribal, and local governments, our partners in the private sector, and individual Americans making a difference in their communities.  We must continue to work together to properly recycle and manage materials throughout their lifecycles and ensure that every American’s right to a healthy environment is fulfilled and protected.

To help our Nation achieve our environmental and recycling goals, my Administration is releasing a National Recycling Strategy, which identifies objectives and actions necessary to help fight climate change and create a sustainable national recycling system.  The actions this strategy recommends will help us reach our national recycling goal, and the Federal Government will lead by example across our Federal buildings, lands, and national parks.  The strategy also aims to increase access to recycling so that all Americans can meaningfully participate while ensuring that our solid waste management system does not disproportionately affect communities that are already overburdened with environmental impacts.  Our workplaces, communities, and Federal, State, Tribal, and local governments can all take part in reshaping our recycling system into one that puts the United States at the forefront of environmental stewardship.  You can visit www.epa.gov/recycle for more information on reducing, reusing, and recycling.  

As we continue to pursue bold action to tackle climate change, we can all do our part to create a more sustainable future by making simple changes in our own lives.  Today and every day, we reaffirm our commitment to preserving our precious resources and creating a healthier, cleaner, more just world for our children and future generations.  

NOW, THEREFORE, I, JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR., President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim November 15, 2021, as America Recycles Day.  I call upon the people of the United States of America to observe this day with appropriate programs and activities, and I encourage all Americans to continue their reducing, reusing, and recycling efforts throughout the year.

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twelfth day of November, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty-one, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-sixth.",President,Joe Biden,https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/11/12/a-proclamation-on-america-recycles-day-2021/,,DEVELOPMENT

Biden, Jr. on the Occasion of Archbishop Desmond Tutu’s Birthday","I send my best wishes to Archbishop Desmond Tutu on his 90th birthday and join the world in celebrating his life of service and contributions to humanity.  I’ve been honored to meet and spend time with Archbishop Tutu on several occasions over the years, and like so many others, I am inspired by his personal commitment to championing human rights and to always speaking out for what is right.  The world first came to know Archbishop Tutu as he modeled the highest tenets of his faith in challenging the injustice of Apartheid in South Africa. His courage and moral clarity at that time helped inspire my own commitment as a United States Senator to change American policy toward the Apartheid regime in South Africa. And in the years since, the world has continued to learn from Archbishop Tutu’s message of justice, equality, and reconciliation.

In honor of Archbishop Tutu, let us all recommit ourselves to the work that has animated his life: advancing respect for human rights, strengthening equality, protecting fundamental freedoms, and fighting for racial justice, both at home and around the world.",President,Joe Biden,https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/10/07/statement-by-president-joseph-r-biden-jr-on-the-occasion-of-archbishop-desmond-tutus-birthday/,,OTHERS
United Kingdom,05-May-11,David Cameron,"Statement on the death of Usama bin Laden, and counter terrorism","Read the statement The death of Usama bin Laden will have important consequences for the security of our people at home and abroad and for our foreign policy, including our partnership with Pakistan, our military action in Afghanistan and the wider fight against terrorism across the world. Last night I chaired a meeting of COBR to begin to address some of these issues. The National Security Council has met this morning. And I wanted to come to the House this afternoon, to take the first opportunity to address these consequences directly and answer Hon Members’ questions. Mr Speaker, at 3am yesterday I received a call from President Obama. He informed me that US Special Forces had successfully mounted a targeted operation against a compound in Abbottabad, in Pakistan. Usama bin Laden had been killed, along with four others: bin Laden’s son, two others linked to him, and a female member of his family entourage. There was a ferocious firefight, and a US helicopter had to be destroyed but there was no loss of American life. I am sure the whole House will join me in congratulating President Obama and praising the courage and skill of the American Special Forces who carried out this operation. It is a strike at the heart of international terrorism, and a great achievement for America and for all who have joined in the long struggle to defeat Al Qaeda. We should remember today in particular the brave British servicemen and women who have given their lives in the fight against terrorism across the world. And we should pay tribute especially to those British forces who have played their part over the last decade in the hunt for bin Laden. He was the man who was responsible for 9/11 - which was not only an horrific killing of Americans, but remains to this day, the largest loss of British life in any terrorist attack. A man who inspired further atrocities including in Bali, Madrid, Istanbul and of course, here in London on 7/7. …and, let us remember, a man who posed as a leader of Muslims but was actually a mass murderer of Muslims all over the world. Indeed he killed more Muslims than people of any other faith. Mr Speaker, nothing will bring back the loved ones who have been lost and of course no punishment at our disposal can remotely fit the many appalling crimes for which he was responsible. But I hope that at least for the victims’ families there is now a sense of justice being served, as a long dark chapter in their lives is finally closed. As the head of a family group for United Airlines Flight 93, put it - we are “raised, obviously, never to hope for someone’s death” but we are “willing to make an exception in this case … He was evil personified, and our world is a better place without him.” Mr Speaker, Britain was with America from the first day of the struggle to defeat Al Qaeda. Our resolve today is as strong as it was then. There can be no impunity and no safe-refuge for those who kill in the name of this poisonous ideology. Security Mr Speaker, our first focus must be our own security. While bin Laden is gone, the threat of Al Qaeda remains. Clearly there is a risk that Al Qaeda and its affiliates in places like Yemen and the Mahgreb will want to demonstrate they are able to operate effectively. And, of course, there is always the risk of a radicalised individual acting alone, a so-called lone-wolf attack. So we must be more vigilant than ever - and we must maintain that vigilance for some time to come. The terrorist threat level in the UK is already at Severe - which is as high as it can go without intelligence of a specific threat. We will keep that threat level under review - working closely with the intelligence agencies and the police. In terms of people travelling overseas, we have updated our advice and encourage British nationals to monitor the media carefully for local reactions, remain vigilant, exercise caution in public places and avoid demonstrations. And we have ordered our embassies across the world to review their security. Pakistan Mr Speaker, let me turn next to Pakistan. The fact that bin Laden was living in a large house in a populated area suggests that he must have had a support network in Pakistan. We don’t currently know the extent of that network, so it is right that we ask searching questions about it. And we will. But let’s start with what we do know. Pakistan has suffered more from terrorism than any other country in the world. As President Zardari and Prime Minister Gilani said to me when I spoke to them yesterday, as many as 30,000 innocent civilians have been killed. And more Pakistani soldiers and security forces have died fighting extremism than international forces killed in Afghanistan. Usama Bin Laden was an enemy of Pakistan. He had declared war against the Pakistani people. And he had ordered attacks against them. President Obama said in his statement: “counterterrorism cooperation with Pakistan helped lead us to bin Laden and the compound where he was hiding.” Continued co-operation will be just as important in the days ahead. I believe it is in Britain’s national interest to recognise that we share the same struggle against terrorism. That’s why we will continue to work with our Pakistani counterparts on intelligence gathering, tracing plots and taking action to stop them. It’s why we will continue to honour our aid promises - including our support for education as a critical way of helping the next generation of Pakistanis to turn their back on extremism and look forward to a brighter and more prosperous future. But above all, it’s why we were one of the founder members of the Friends of Democratic Pakistan. Because it is by working with the democrats in Pakistan that we can make sure the whole country shares the same determination to fight terror. Afghanistan Mr Speaker, I also spoke yesterday to President Karzai in Afghanistan. We both agreed that the death of bin Laden provides a new opportunity for Afghanistan and Pakistan to work together to achieve stability on both sides of the border. Our strategy towards Afghanistan is straightforward and has not changed. We want an Afghanistan capable of looking after its own security without the help of foreign forces. We should take this opportunity to send a clear message to the Taleban: now is the time for them to separate themselves from Al Qaeda and participate in a peaceful political process. Mr Speaker, the myth of Bin Laden was one of a freedom fighter, living in austerity and risking his life for the cause as he moved around in the hills and mountainous caverns of the tribal areas. The reality of Bin Laden was very different: a man who encouraged others to make the ultimate sacrifice while he himself hid in the comfort of a large, expensive villa in Pakistan, experiencing none of the hardship he expected his supporters to endure. Libya Mr Speaker, finally let me briefly update the House on Libya. In recent weeks we have stepped up our air campaign to protect the civilian population. Every element of Qadhafi’s war machine has been degraded. Over the last few days alone, NATO aircraft have struck 35 targets including tanks and armoured personnel carriers, as well as bunkers and ammunition storage facilities. We have also made strikes against his command and control centres which direct his operations against civilians. Over the weekend there were reports that in one of those strikes Colonel Qadhafi’s son, Saif al-Arab Qadhafi, was killed. All the targets chosen were clearly within the boundaries set by UN Resolutions 1970 and 1973. These Resolutions permit all necessary measures to protect civilian life - including attacks on command and control bases. Mr Speaker, this weekend also saw attacks on the British and Italian embassies. We utterly deplore this. The Qadhafi regime is in clear beach of the Vienna convention to protect diplomatic missions. We hold them fully to account. And we have already expelled the Libyan Ambassador from London. The British embassy was looted as well as destroyed. The World War Two Memorial was desecrated. And the UN have felt obliged to pull their people out for fear of attack. Qadhafi made much of his call for a ceasefire. But at the very moment Qadhafi claimed he wanted to talk, he had in fact been laying mines in Misurata harbour to stop humanitarian aid getting in and continuing his attacks on civilians, including attacks across the border in neighbouring Tunisia. Mr Speaker, we must continue to enforce the UN resolutions fully until such a time as they are completely complied with. And that means continuing the NATO mission until there is an end to all attacks on - and threats to - civilians. Conclusion Mr Speaker, bin Laden and Qadhafi were said to have hated each other. But there was a common thread running between them. They both feared the idea that democracy and civil rights could take hold in the Arab world. While we should continue to degrade, dismantle and defeat the terrorist networks a big part of the long term answer is the success of democracy in the Middle East and the conclusion of the Arab-Israeli peace process. For twenty years, bin Laden claimed that the future of the Muslim world would be his. But what Libya has shown - as Egypt and Tunisia before it - is that people are rejecting everything that bin Laden stood for. Instead of replacing dictatorship with his extremist totalitarianism, they are choosing democracy. Ten years on from the terrible tragedy of 9/11, with the end of bin Laden and the democratic awakening across the Arab world, we must seize this unique opportunity to deliver a decisive break with the forces of Al Qaeda and its poisonous ideology which has caused so much suffering for so many years. And I commend this statement to the House.",Prime Minister,David Cameron,https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/statement-on-the-death-of-usama-bin-laden-and-counter-terrorism,,EXTREMISM
Russia,02-09-2009 00:00,Dmitry Medvedev,Opening Remarks at Meeting on Economic Issues,"Colleagues,

Today we are meeting to discuss the decisions we need to take to ensure Russia’s continued social and economic development this year. We realise that the global economic crisis has not yet reached its peak. The experts’ assessments attest to this, and so do my contacts with other countries’ leaders. There are a great many different forecasts.

But practically none of these forecasts expect any pickup in the world economy before 2010. Most analysts, specialists and those involved in the economy in practice think that the next year will be very difficult. Consequently, we should not expect any significant increase in foreign demand for our products and goods, or any revival of capital inflow of the level we would like. In this situation, we need to once more analyse how to best adjust our policies and measures, above all our budget policy.

Our main priority remains unchanged, namely, to fulfil all of our social commitments. You have been working on this. Over these last months, the Government has carried out weekly monitoring of the social and economic situation, and this work needs to continue. To maintain stable development you need to make more active use of the instruments already approved and that have already proven their effectiveness.

At the same time, a number of the guidelines set last autumn now require additional discussion. I am referring to the budget parameters and to maintaining the financial system’s normal operation. In fulfilling all of our social commitments (and this top priority remains in place), we also need to maintain macroeconomic stability, not let prices rise too far, and try to conserve needed resources for the possibility that the crisis in the global economy will continue beyond the current year. We have decent reserves – around 5 trillion roubles [approximately $139 billion] in the Reserve Fund, and 3 trillion roubles [approximately $83.5 billion] in the National Prosperity Fund. We can maintain our budget spending commitments this year without having to resort to excessive and expensive borrowing.

At the same time, I propose that we look further today and examine the amount of anti-crisis spending we can afford in order to maintain sustained development in the medium term. We always need to think about the future, including during crisis periods. I remind you in this respect that the National Prosperity Fund’s purpose is to maintain the pension system’s stability. This money needs to be managed in such a way as to preserve it inasmuch as possible, all the more so as one of our objectives is to increase pension payments, this year too, in accordance with the figures that have already been announced.

I know that the ministries have discussed the possibility of replacing less urgent, relevant and effective expenditure with programmes that could produce significant results this year. This concerns above all infrastructure programmes, construction programmes, housing programmes and banks’ capitalisation. We need to look at the financial possibilities available for this.

We need to make the final principled decisions today, and once the Government has examined them, we need to submit the amended budget law to the State Duma. This is the ultimate purpose of today’s meeting.

Let’s start work.",President,Dmitry Medvedev,http://en.kremlin.ru/events/president/transcripts/statements/3099,,DEVELOPMENT

Remarks by the President at the Dedication of the National Museum of African American History and Culture","James Baldwin once wrote, “For while the tale of how we suffer, and how we are delighted, and how we may triumph is never new, it always must be heard.”  For while the tale of how we suffer, and how we are delighted, and how we may triumph is never new, it always must be heard.   

Today, as so many generations have before, we gather on our National Mall to tell an essential part of our American story -- one that has at times been overlooked -- we come not just for today, but for all time.

                                      

President and Mrs. Bush; President Clinton; Vice President and Dr. Biden; Chief Justice Roberts; Secretary Skorton; Reverend Butts; distinguished guests:  Thank you.  Thank you for your leadership in making sure this tale is told.  We’re here in part because of you and because of all those Americans -- the Civil War vets, the Civil Rights foot soldiers, the champions of this effort on Capitol Hill -- who, for more than a century, kept the dream of this museum alive. 

That includes our leaders in Congress -- Paul Ryan and Nancy Pelosi.  It includes one of my heroes, John Lewis, who, as he has so often, took the torch from those who came before him and brought us past the finish line.  It includes the philanthropists and benefactors and advisory members who have so generously given not only their money but their time.  It includes the Americans who offered up all the family keepsakes tucked away in Grandma’s attic.  And of course, it includes a man without whose vision and passion and persistence we would not be here today -- Mr. Lonnie Bunch.  (Applause.)   

What we can see of this building -- the towering glass, the artistry of the metalwork -- is surely a sight to behold.  But beyond the majesty of the building, what makes this occasion so special is the larger story it contains.  Below us, this building reaches down 70 feet, its roots spreading far wider and deeper than any tree on this Mall.  And on its lowest level, after you walk past remnants of a slave ship, after you reflect on the immortal declaration that “all men are created equal,” you can see a block of stone.  On top of this stone sits a historical marker, weathered by the ages.  That marker reads:  “General Andrew Jackson and Henry Clay spoke from this slave block…during the year 1830.” 

I want you to think about this.  Consider what this artifact tells us about history, about how it’s told, and about what can be cast aside.  On a stone where day after day, for years, men and women were torn from their spouse or their child, shackled and bound, and bought and sold, and bid like cattle; on a stone worn down by the tragedy of over a thousand bare feet -- for a long time, the only thing we considered important, the singular thing we once chose to commemorate as “history” with a plaque were the unmemorable speeches of two powerful men. 

And that block I think explains why this museum is so necessary.  Because that same object, reframed, put in context, tells us so much more.  As Americans, we rightfully passed on the tales of the giants who built this country; who led armies into battle and waged seminal debates in the halls of Congress and the corridors of power.  But too often, we ignored or forgot the stories of millions upon millions of others, who built this nation just as surely, whose humble eloquence, whose calloused hands, whose steady drive helped to create cities, erect industries, build the arsenals of democracy. 

And so this national museum helps to tell a richer and fuller story of who we are.  It helps us better understand the lives, yes, of the President, but also the slave; the industrialist, but also the porter; the keeper of the status quo, but also of the activist seeking to overthrow that status quo; the teacher or the cook, alongside the statesman.  And by knowing this other story, we better understand ourselves and each other. It binds us together.  It reaffirms that all of us are America -- that African-American history is not somehow separate from our larger American story, it's not the underside of the American story, it is central to the American story.  That our glory derives not just from our most obvious triumphs, but how we’ve wrested triumph from tragedy, and how we've been able to remake ourselves, again and again and again, in accordance with our highest ideals. 

I, too, am America.

The great historian John Hope Franklin, who helped to get this museum started, once said, “Good history is a good foundation for a better present and future.”  He understood the best history doesn’t just sit behind a glass case; it helps us to understand what’s outside the case.  The best history helps us recognize the mistakes that we’ve made and the dark corners of the human spirit that we need to guard against.  And, yes, a clear-eyed view of history can make us uncomfortable, and shake us out of familiar narratives.  But it is precisely because of that discomfort that we learn and grow and harness our collective power to make this nation more perfect.

That’s the American story that this museum tells -- one of suffering and delight; one of fear but also of hope; of wandering in the wilderness and then seeing out on the horizon a glimmer of the Promised Land. 

It is in this embrace of truth, as best as we can know it, in the celebration of the entire American experience, where real patriotism lies.  As President Bush just said, a great nation doesn’t shy from the truth.  It strengthens us.  It emboldens us. It should fortify us.  It is an act of patriotism to understand where we've been.  And this museum tells the story of so many patriots. 

Yes, African Americans have felt the cold weight of shackles and the stinging lash of the field whip.  But we’ve also dared to run north, and sing songs from Harriet Tubman’s hymnal.  We’ve buttoned up our Union Blues to join the fight for our freedom. We’ve railed against injustice for decade upon decade -- a lifetime of struggle, and progress, and enlightenment that we see etched in Frederick Douglass’s mighty, leonine gaze.

         

Yes, this museum tells a story of people who felt the indignity, the small and large humiliations of a “whites only” sign, or wept at the side of Emmett Till’s coffin, or fell to their knees on shards of stained glass outside a church where four little girls died.  But it also tells the story of the black youth and white youth sitting alongside each other, straight-backed, so full of dignity on those lunch counter stools; the story of a six-year-old Ruby Bridges, pigtails, fresh-pressed dress, walking that gauntlet to get to school; Tuskegee airmen soaring the skies not just to beat a dictator, but to reaffirm the promise of our democracy -- (applause) -- but remind us that all of us are created equal. 

This is the place to understand how protest and love of country don’t merely coexist but inform each other; how men can proudly win the gold for their country but still insist on raising a black-gloved fist; how we can wear “I Can’t Breathe”

T-shirt and still grieve for fallen police officers.  Here’s the America where the razor-sharp uniform of the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff belongs alongside the cape of the Godfather of Soul.  (Laughter.)  We have shown the world that we can float like butterflies and sting like bees; that we can rocket into space like Mae Jemison, steal home like Jackie, rock like Jimi, stir the pot like Richard Pryor; or we can be sick and tired of being sick and tired, like Fannie Lou Hamer, and still Rock Steady like Aretha Franklin.  (Applause.)   

We are large, Walt Whitman told us, containing multitudes.  We are large, containing multitudes.  Full of contradictions.  That's America.  That's what makes us grow.  That's what makes us extraordinary.  And as is true for America, so is true for African American experience.  We're not a burden on America, or a stain on America, or an object of pity or charity for America.  We're America.  (Applause.) 

And that's what this museum explains -- the fact that our stories have shaped every corner of our culture.  The struggles for freedom that took place made our Constitution a real and living document, tested and shaped and deepened and made more profound its meaning for all people.  The story told here doesn’t just belong to black Americans; it belongs to all Americans -- for the African-American experience has been shaped just as much by Europeans and Asians and Native Americans and Latinos.  We have informed each other.  We are polyglot, a stew. 

Scripture promised that if we lift up the oppressed, then our light will rise in the darkness, and our night will become like the noonday.  And the story contained in this museum makes those words prophecy.  And that’s what this day is about.  That’s what this museum is about.  I, too, am America.  It is a glorious story, the one that's told here.  It is complicated and it is messy and it is full of contradictions, as all great stories are, as Shakespeare is, as Scripture is.  And it’s a story that perhaps needs to be told now more than ever.

A museum alone will not alleviate poverty in every inner city or every rural hamlet.  It won't eliminate gun violence from all our neighborhoods, or immediately ensure that justice is always colorblind.  It won't wipe away every instance of discrimination in a job interview or a sentencing hearing or folks trying to rent an apartment.  Those things are up to us, the decisions and choices we make.  It requires speaking out, and organizing, and voting, until our values are fully reflected in our laws and our policies and our communities.

But what this museum does show us is that in even the face of oppression, even in the face of unimaginable difficulty, America has moved forward.  And so this museum provides context for the debates of our times.  It illuminates them and gives us some sense of how they evolved, and perhaps keeps them in proportion.  Perhaps it can help a white visitor understand the pain and anger of demonstrators in places like Tulsa and Charlotte.  But it can also help black visitors appreciate the fact that not only is this younger generation carrying on traditions of the past but, within the white communities across this nation we see the sincerity of law enforcement officers and officials who, in fits and starts, are struggling to understand, and are trying to do the right thing. 

It reminds us that routine discrimination and Jim Crow aren't ancient history, it's just a blink in the eye of history. It was just yesterday.  And so we should not be surprised that not all the healing is done.  We shouldn’t despair that it’s not all solved.  And knowing the larger story should instead remind us of just how remarkable the changes that have taken place truly are -- just in my lifetime -- and thereby inspire us to further progress. 

And so hopefully this museum can help us talk to each other. And more importantly, listen to each other.  And most importantly, see each other.  Black and white and Latino and Native American and Asian American -- see how our stories are bound together.  And bound together with women in America, and workers in America, and entrepreneurs in America, and LGBT Americans.  And for young people who didn’t live through the struggles represented here, I hope you draw strength from the changes that have taken place.  Come here and see the power of your own agency.  See how young John Lewis was.  These were children who transformed a nation in a blink of an eye.  Young people, come here and see your ability to make your mark.

The very fact of this day does not prove that America is perfect, but it does validate the ideas of our founding, that this country born of change, this country born of revolution, this country of we, the people, this country can get better.

And that’s why we celebrate, mindful that our work is not yet done; mindful that we are but on a waystation on this common journey towards freedom.  And how glorious it is that we enshrine it here, on some of our nation’s most hallowed ground -- the same place where lives were once traded but also where hundreds of thousands of Americans, of all colors and creeds, once marched.  How joyful it is that this story take its rightful place -- alongside Jefferson who declared our independence, and Washington who made it real, and alongside Lincoln who saved our union, and the GIs who defended it; alongside a new monument to a King, gazing outward, summoning us toward that mountaintop.  How righteous it is that with  tell this story here.

For almost eight years, I have been blessed with the extraordinary honor of serving you in this office.  (Applause.)  Time and again, I’ve flown low over this mall on Marine One, often with Michelle and our daughters.  And President Clinton, President Bush, they’ll tell you it is incredible sight.  We pass right across the Washington Monument -- it feels like you can reach out and touch it.  And at night, if you turn the other way, you don't just see the Lincoln Memorial, Old Abe is lit up and you can see him, his spirit glowing from that building.  And we don’t have many trips left.  But over the years, I’ve always been comforted as I’ve watched this museum rise from this earth into this remarkable tribute.  Because I know that years from now, like all of you, Michelle and I will be able to come here to this museum, and not just bring our kids but hopefully our grandkids. I imagine holding a little hand of somebody and tell them the stories that are enshrined here. 

And in the years that follow, they’ll be able to do the same.  And then we’ll go to the Lincoln Memorial and we'll take in the view atop the Washington Monument.  And together, we’ll learn about ourselves, as Americans -- our sufferings, our delights, and our triumphs.  And we’ll walk away better for it, better because the better grasp of history.  We'll walk away that much more in love with this country, the only place on Earth where this story could have unfolded.  (Applause.)

It is a monument, no less than the others on this Mall, to the deep and abiding love for this country, and the ideals upon which it is founded.  For we, too, are America.

So enough talk.  President Bush is timing me.  (Laughter.) He had the over/under at 25.  (Laughter.)  Let us now open this museum to the world.  Today, we have with us a family that reflects the arc of our progress:  the Bonner family -- four generations in all, starting with gorgeous seven-year-old Christine and going up to gorgeous 99-year-old Ruth.  (Applause.)   

Now, Ruth’s father, Elijah Odom, was born into servitude in Mississippi.  He was born a slave.  As a young boy, he ran, though, to his freedom.  He lived through Reconstruction and he lived through Jim Crow.  But he went on to farm, and graduate from medical school, and gave life to the beautiful family that we see today -- with a spirit reflected in beautiful Christine, free and equal in the laws of her country and in the eyes of God.

So in a brief moment, their family will join us in ringing a bell from the First Baptist Church in Virginia -- one of the oldest black churches in America, founded under a grove of trees in 1776.  And the sound of this bell will be echoed by others in houses of worship and town squares all across this country -- an echo of the ringing bells that signaled Emancipation more than a century and a half ago; the sound, and the anthem, of American freedom.

God bless you all.  God bless the United States of America.  (Applause.) ",President,Barack Obama,https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/the-press-office/2016/09/24/remarks-president-dedication-national-museum-african-american-history,,NATIONALISM

Weekly Address: Providing a Better, Cleaner, Safer Future for Our Children"," Hi, everybody.  One of the most urgent challenges of our time is climate change.  We know that 2015 surpassed 2014 as the warmest year on record – and 2016 is on pace to be even hotter.  

When I took office, I said this was something we couldn’t kick down the road any longer – that our children’s future depended on our action.  So we got to work, and over the past seven-and-a-half years, we’ve made ambitious investments in clean energy, and ambitious reductions in our carbon emissions.  We’ve multiplied wind power threefold.  We’ve multiplied solar power more than thirtyfold.  In parts of America, these clean power sources are finally cheaper than dirtier, conventional power.  And carbon pollution from our energy sector is at its lowest level in 25 years, even as we’re continuing to grow our economy.

We’ve invested in energy efficiency, and we’re slashing carbon emissions from appliances, homes, and businesses – saving families money on their energy bills.  We’re reforming how we manage federal coal resources, which supply roughly 40% of America’s coal.  We’ve set the first-ever national standards limiting the amount of carbon pollution power plants can release into the sky. 

We also set standards to increase the distance our cars and light trucks can go on a gallon of gas every year through 2025.  And they’re working.  At a time when we’ve seen auto sales surge, manufacturers are innovating and bringing new technology to market faster than expected.  Over 100 cars, SUVs, and pick-up trucks on the market today already meet our vehicles standards ahead of schedule.  And we’ve seen a boom in the plug-in electric vehicle market – with more models, lower battery costs, and more than 16,000 charging stations. 

But we’re not done yet. In the weeks and months ahead, we’ll release a second round of fuel efficiency standards for heavy-duty vehicles. We’ll take steps to meet the goal we set with Canada and Mexico to achieve 50 percent clean power across North America by 2025.  And we’ll continue to protect our lands and waters so that our kids and grandkids can enjoy our most beautiful spaces for generations. 

There’s still much more to do.  But there’s no doubt that America has become a global leader in the fight against climate change.  Last year, that leadership helped us bring nearly 200 nations together in Paris around the most ambitious agreement in history to save the one planet we’ve got.  That’s not something to tear up – it’s something to build upon.  And if we keep pushing, and leading the world in the right direction, there’s no doubt that, together, we can leave a better, cleaner, safer future for our children.

Remarks by the President before Cabinet Meeting","Well, today, I have the opportunity to welcome two of the newest members of our Cabinet who haven't had a chance to be at a Cabinet meeting before -- our new Secretary of Defense Ash Carter, and our new Attorney General Loretta Lynch.  We want to give them a big round of applause.  (Applause.)   

Each of the men and women around this table have a very simple mission -- although it's hard to execute -- and that is how do we make sure that we are continually expanding opportunity, prosperity, and security for the American people.  The good news is, about halfway through 2015, we've already seen some significant progress.  The unemployment rate is now at its lowest in almost seven years.  Businesses created 3 million jobs over the past 12 months, nearly the fastest pace in over a decade.  On the health care front, the uninsured rate has now fallen by the largest amount in four decades, even as health care inflation continues to be lower than it has been in a very long time. 

So our work is paying off.  But we've got to build on that progress.  And our overarching goal remains the same, which is how do we make sure everybody in this country gets opportunity.  That means that we're going to keep fighting to make sure that community colleges are as free and as universal as high school.  It means we're going to go after issues of poverty and inequality, both urban and rural.  It means that we're going to continue to expand on our job training agenda and our apprenticeship agenda so that people of all ages have the skills that they need to succeed in this economy. 

It means we're going to continue to go after ISIL, get a strong deal that prevents Iran from getting a nuclear weapon.  And as part of our agenda for middle-class economics, it means that we're going to continue to pursue strong trade agreements that benefit American workers and American businesses.

And I want to thank the bipartisan group of senators who took a big step forward this morning on the trade agenda that is consistent with strong labor standards, strong environmental standards, and is going to open up access to markets that too often are closed even as these other countries are selling goods here in the United States.  It's an agenda that's good for U.S. businesses, but most importantly, good for American workers.

So we've got a lot to do over the next year and a half.  We're going to run through the tape.  And I'm going to be hearing from everybody around this table in terms of how we are going to make sure that all of our agencies are working on all cylinders to accomplish these goals.

Thank you very much, everybody.",President,Barack Obama,https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/the-press-office/2015/05/21/remarks-president-cabinet-meeting,,DEVELOPMENT
Russia,19-12-2000,Vladimir Putin,"Extracts from a Speech to Leading Canadian Businessmen, Politicians and Public Figures","<…> The spirit of cooperation that has established itself between Canada and Russia over the recent centuries of diplomatic and business contacts bodes well for our partnership. Of course, the main guarantee of success is political and economic stability. This year Russia has made substantial progress in “putting the Federation back again” after a period when, unfortunately, it often looked very much like a decentralised state. I would like to stress, not as a federated, but as a decentralized state.

Putting the Federation back together was behind the creation this year of seven federal districts and behind the efforts to harmonize the laws of the regions with the country’s Constitution.

When I refer to the decentralisation of Russia in recent years I would like to draw your attention to the lamentable fact that about 25% of all the laws and legal acts in the regions of the Russian Federation have been at odds with the Constitution and laws of Russia.

It was of course a major obstacle in the way of the development of the Russian state and Russian business. It made it more difficult for foreign partners to enter the Russian economy. The system of state governance has recently been substantially strengthened and gaps in the common business and economic space have been closed. The result is a measure of political stabilization and consolidation of society that is evident to many.

Today all the branches of government in Russia are interacting very fruitfully, as reflected above all in the activities of the country’s parliament, the Russian State Duma. Order and political stability inevitably lead to order in the economy. The business and investment climate in the country is undergoing major changes. Our country today looks a lot more attractive than several years ago.

This is borne out by figures. I don’t want to tire you with too many figures, but I will cite just some. Gross domestic product increased by 7.5% in the first half of the year. We expect that growth by the end of the year will be at least 7%. Industrial potential has increased by 15–20%, and in some regions industry has grown by 30%. Investments in basic assets have increased and inflation has been cut by more than half. In any case all the macroeconomic targets set under this year’s budget have been met.

The average incomes of Russians increased by 9.4% in ten months of this year compared with the same period of 1999. For the first time the country has a federal budget surplus, and that is not only the basis for sustained economic growth but for settling our relations with the creditors. I am referring, of course, to the creditors of the London and Paris Clubs.

Canada and Russia are the biggest federations in the world. But they have in common much more than the complicated problems that are inevitable in such complicated systems. It is important that our countries have broad opportunities offered by their federative systems. One such economic advantage is economic flexibility because federalism makes it possible to level out the social and economic opportunities of various regions and to provide an equal playing field for all Russian citizens irrespective of where they live. The economic autonomy of the provinces always provides a good testing ground for effective and progressive federal models, and indeed a testing ground for trying out strategic models of national development as a whole. And these are just some of the advantages of a federation.

I am convinced that we have much in common. Above all, the heady prospects for the economic development of our federated systems. It is also important that we are not just aware of our obvious achievements, but we are serious and upfront about our drawbacks. This was highlighted by the results of the roundtable on the problems of federalism held here in Canada. It was attended by practical workers, representatives of government bodies, the heads of Canadian provinces and Russian regions and leading experts of the two countries. I think we should heed their opinion. Such interstate discussions should be regular and should be held both in Canada and Russia.

Russian-Canadian interaction in some spheres is, I think, absolutely unique. Above all, it is the so-called Northern Dimension, the plans for joint development of the Arctic and the North and its social aspect: support of the indigenous peoples of the North, preservation of their cultures, traditions and language. All this is equally important both for Russia and Canada. A number of joint cultural, educational and other humanitarian programmes for small indigenous peoples of the North are geared to that goal.

Another project aimed at developing the northern territories is the Arctic Bridge designed to switch the main cargo traffic between the two countries to the northern sea routes. In Russia it is an effective exercise, which was successfully pursued back in the Soviet times. I am convinced that with the development of the Arctic hub our countries will become much closer to each other, and we have a whole package of promising projects connected with the North.

Increase in mutual trade is another untapped reserve of our cooperation. The existing legal treaties and documents provide a basis for that. Our mutual trade in oil, metals, chemicals, machines and equipment has increased considerably of late. It is in our common interests to make these positive trends stable, to create additional conditions to facilitate the access of goods to the markets in the two countries.

In this connection we are particularly worried about the restrictive measures applied by Canada to Russian steel. We discussed it at yesterday’s meetings with the Canadian Prime Minister and Cabinet members.

<…>

We regard attracting foreign investments as an important factor of Russia’s integration into the world economy. We have been taking vigorous measures recently towards that end. We have made considerable progress on tax reform. The new Tax Code that comes into force on January 1, 2001 sets the lowest tax rates in Europe. I must say that it has been a difficult decision that Russia has long contemplated. The code was eventually adopted only due to the public consensus and the synergy of various non-governmental and political forces in the country. That is clear evidence of the considerable political stabilization in Russia.

We are staunch supporters of the basic principles of Russian policy: protection of the rights of owners and honest businessmen. In fact a whole range of laws aimed at strengthening the legal rights of owners is being prepared. We are taking serious measures to strengthen the judiciary system, which is an inalienable element of a smoothly functioning economic mechanism.

In recent years we have enlarged the regulatory framework for investments. The new law On Foreign Investments in the Russian Federation regulates the activities of foreign investments and guarantees their rights. The regions are implementing their own programmes of government support for foreign investment activities.

In opening up the Russian economy we expect reciprocity from our partners, including at the international financial institutions. I think the process of Russia’s accession to the WTO and the OECD could be more dynamic than it is today. Russia has reason to count on Canada’s support on the issue. I think that if the principles and rules of that organisation are applied in Russia, everyone will gain from it, including our foreign partners.

Integration of Russian business in the world economy addresses the needs not only of our own country. It is in the common interests of many countries which in the context of globalization are jointly seeking new ways of interaction and trying to create a favourable international climate for cooperation. This is the aim of Russian foreign policy. We favour a system of international mechanisms that balances international interests, ensures the integrity and security of the world and helps to solve common problems. We believe that all the key issues should be solved on the basis of international law, through collective mechanisms, in the first place those of the United Nations.

This brings me to the key problem that is uppermost in people’s minds today, the problem of international security. We are convinced that the deployment of a national missile defence and attempts to wreck the 1972 ABM Treaty will result only in a collapse of the whole system of international security. Our concern is shared by many countries and prominent political and national leaders in many countries. Further evidence of that was the open letter I have received from a prominent Canadian scientist, Nobel Prize winner, Professor John Polanyi of the University of Toronto who is present here. We talked briefly with him before this meeting. I take this opportunity to thank Mr Polanyi for his letter. As I see it, it is prompted by concern for security and stability in the world. It provides an absolutely objective and independent analysis. It would not be irrelevant to quote from that letter: “If we start modifying the ABM Treaty, it would weaken the structures of international law on which peace on the planet must be based.” That is an absolutely precise formula that pinpoints the issue.

We see as a real alternative further drastic reductions of nuclear arsenals while preserving the 1972 ABM Treaty and putting into effect the START-2 Treaty which we have already ratified, but the United States has yet to ratify, and an early start to real negotiations on START-3. A logical sequel to this approach is our latest proposal of cutting the number of Russian and US nuclear warheads to 1500 or even less. The creation of an effective global missile technology non-proliferation regime fully meets the goal of strategic stability. It should combine a global system of monitoring missiles and missile technologies and measures to improve these procedures. We also offer broad interaction in the sphere of so-called theatre missile defence. The Moscow Joint Warning Centre on Missile Launches now being created by Russia and the United States and which will be open to all the interested countries is an element of such cooperation. We hope that these initiatives will meet with a good response, including in Canada.

Russia appreciates the responsible policy Canada pursues on key world issues. We closely cooperate within the G8, at the UN and are actively cooperating in the sphere of peacekeeping and the settlement of regional conflicts. Many of Canada’s leaders call their country a “medium power”, but Canada in fact pursues a global policy and we are ready to cooperate in all areas.

Russia,27-09-2000,Vladimir Putin,Excerpts from the Introductory Speech at a Meeting with Security Council Members to Discuss Ways of Improving the State’s Military Development Policy,"Good afternoon!

Today, we planned to hold a meeting of the Security Council, but later in the day, after a meeting with the Security Council Secretary and the Prime Minister, it was decided to postpone it.

Nevertheless, in the time we have we must discuss an important issue, namely, the problems of military development. We believed it was possible to postpone the meeting because, in my opinion, it will take some more time to finalise the wording of the Security Council resolution and its conclusions. I know that the heads of virtually every department have some objections. I want to draw your attention to the fact that the decisions that we will take are extremely important for the national military establishment and military development in general.

It took us over two months to prepare for the previous Security Council meeting, which discussed the future development of the Armed Forces …

… I want to tell you that Russia spends over 35% of its budgetary allocations on military departments and ministries. 35% is a lot, perhaps too much. Therefore, unfortunately, we cannot boast a cost-effective disbursement of state funding and taxpayers’ money for the functions and tasks of the national military establishment.

The discrepancy between the Armed Forces and the so-called military units of other ministries and departments is the main problem here. Apart from the Defence Ministry, 11 other security agencies have their own military units, which uphold law and order, accomplish civil defence objectives, carry out transport functions, etc. There are also construction, engineering, and road-building units, as well as industrial and research facilities employing civilians … Unfortunately, we have only a vague idea of this machine’s real scope.

Military professionalism and the ability to effectively accomplish defence-related objectives have always been and will remain the main criteria of all work in this sphere. Although we are spending colossal amounts of money on the national military establishment, defence-budget allocations are sometimes being spent on unimportant programmes which have nothing to do with the army’s combat readiness and its logistical support.

We have no right to exploit the people’s enthusiasm and heroism when tackling military tasks. We simply cannot maintain an army unless we introduce new technologies and equipment. What we need is a modern, flexible, mobile and combat-ready army.

This does not mean that we must merely reduce the size of the Armed Forces and other military units. The army must become smaller but more effective. Strengthening the military establishment’s security component is an essential condition for introducing professional military service. At the same time, we must always balance military requirements and the state’s economic capability.

Efforts to plan the operation of the entire, huge military establishment are becoming particularly important today. Our measures must be modified in line with previous proposals and decisions regarding the Armed Forces, the main element of the military establishment. What we need is long-term analytical studies to be carried out for many years ahead. The newly established expert commission headed by Security Council Secretary Sergei Ivanov must engage in all-out, constructive work.

Unfortunately, we are still unable to coordinate all aspects of military reform. The heads of some ministries and departments are advocating nothing but cosmetic measures.

I want to stress that we must now understand that maintaining parallel military units impairs the national defence capability and is also detrimental to the Armed Forces … The Armed Forces, which are taking responsible decisions, advocate reform and believe this is possible. But we are also considering the state’s real economic capacity and will try and find additional reserves for supporting the Armed Forces. Such reserves will be found in other ministries and departments that have military units.

… This issue has been under examination for 45 days, and I will give you another 30 days to finalise it. But I want to stress that the main parameters stipulated by the Security Council staff will be complied with.

<…>

And now the last thing. All our reforms must facilitate more effective solutions to social problems facing the army and all other ministries and departments that maintain military units. This is a highly important issue because any reform will prove impossible unless we lay out and coordinate these aspects in advance. Everything will grind to a halt in the face of unsolved social problems. Moreover, we simply have no right to put people who have served their Fatherland well for many years in a difficult situation.

This is why I want to stress that, instead of across-the-board and indiscriminate cuts, we will carry out well thought-out, calm and smooth work to streamline the activities and organisation of the Russian war machine and to improve the quality of its work. This is what our decisions are supposed to accomplish.",President,Vladimir Putin,http://en.kremlin.ru/events/president/transcripts/statements/24271,,OTHERS
Russia,16-11-2020,Vladimir Putin,Security Council meeting,"Colleagues, good afternoon.

Today we will discuss the main ways to improve the state antidrug policy. This topic is definitely extremely complex, embraces many aspects and directly affects national security. I will say even more – without any exaggeration, it affects the future of our people.

Drugs cripple and kill thousands of Russians every year. They bring suffering to children, and young people in general, bring pain and grief to families, and undermine the moral foundations of society. The shadow profits from the drug business are used as financial support for criminals, for cross-border crime, corruption, terrorist and extremist groups. It is a challenge that Russia and practically all other countries are facing.

I would like to note right away that over the past ten years, the implementation of the Russian State Antidrug Policy Strategy has enabled us to take a number of important steps in the fight against the drug threat. Thus, punishment for the sale and smuggling of drugs or their analogues, the punishment for the distribution of drugs online, in educational institutions, and crowded social venues has been increased drastically, up to life imprisonment.

A fundamentally new legal mechanism for encouraging drug addicts to get treatment and rehabilitation has been added to the legal framework. In the last three years alone, over 85 percent of pupils in schools, students in technical colleges, and universities – a total of more than 6 million people – have been tested for drug addiction through social and psychological evaluation.

Largely due to the measures taken, over the course of 10 years the number of officially registered drug users has decreased by more than a quarter: from 673,000 to 478,000, including that of underage users from 7,900 to 5,100. Over the same period, the number of drug crimes decreased by 17 percent, and the number of drug intoxicated criminals dropped by 30 percent.

At the same time, these numbers should not be a reason for complacency. Both drug business and drug use are covert and latent. Analytical materials prepared for our meeting show that the situation remains complicated.

For example, over the first nine months of this year law enforcement agencies detected over 144,500 drug crimes, which is almost equal to the numbers from the same period last year (145,000). Almost 18 tonnes of narcotic and psychotropic substances were confiscated.

Our task is to improve efforts to counter drug trafficking and take more concerted and decisive action on all fronts. This must be the goal of the new Russian State Antidrug Policy Strategy until 2030. We will discuss the draft today.

Of course, continuing the tough uncompromising fight waged by law enforcement agencies and special services against drug dealers is a priority area. Here, results and numbers must be significantly higher than those we have today. This is why I would like to elaborate on these matters. We always discuss this at annual expanded meetings of corresponding agencies.

As I have said, today I would also like to draw your attention to several important points.

First, we can see that criminals increasingly use modern means of communication to sell drugs, while in the supply and distribution schemes, they use contactless payment methods and new non-bank forms of payment more actively. This means there is no need for personal contact between the seller and the buyer. By doing so, criminals try to hide their activities as much as possible.

These trends have further aggravated this year, in conditions of the pandemic and restrictions on socialising. Thus, in the first half of this year, the number of discovered, recorded crimes alone has grown by almost 70 percent. This example shows how modern technology is being used for evil purposes rather than for the good of the people.

Apparently, it is necessary to look for new, more effective ways of countering such latent crimes. Relevant departments of the Ministry of the Interior and the Federal Security Service must enhance their cooperation with Rosfinmonitoring [Federal Financial Monitoring Service] as well as with other agencies.

Secondly, practically all the state borders have been closed this year due to the pandemic. As a consequence of this, during the first half of 2020 drug trafficking into Russia went down by more than a third. This was a blessing in disguise, as they say. But obviously, with the restoration of interstate communications (which is inevitable), attempts to build up drug supplies from other countries will be resumed. This means that now it is time to think over and take additional measures on enhancing border and customs control.

Thirdly, we have said that drug addiction is a misfortune, a serious, hard-to-treat disorder. It is impossible to overcome it in one go. Therefore, it is important to improve the system of rendering medical aid to drug addicts, continue supplying drug-abuse clinics with modern equipment, strengthening their personnel potential and introducing advanced methods of revealing the disorder at early stages when help is timely and most effective.

Fourthly, it is necessary to determine finally a federal body or bodies that are responsible for the social rehabilitation of drug addicts, and formulate uniform requirements in this area for the whole country. Incidentally, the regions have not done this up to now either. The discussion on this subject continues and de facto responsibility is often shifted by some departments to others. All this work has been dragged out for no objective reasons.

In addition to this, it is necessary to enhance control over the activities of private rehabilitation clinics in the regions. In some cases, they flagrantly violate the constitutional rights of our citizens. This problem must be resolved by all means and without delay.

I would also like to highlight the fact that certain Russian region heads often delegate to other officials their assigned powers as chairs of anti-drug commissions. This practice – colleagues, pay attention to this please – which is in fact an attempt to hide behind someone else's back, is absolutely unacceptable.

I would like to remind you once again that coordinating all anti-drug activities is the regional heads’ individual, personal responsibility. And I am requesting the plenipotentiary representatives of the President of Russia in the federal districts to monitor this issue constantly.

Fifth is the expansion and implementation of a modern antidrug awareness policy, including the media, the social media that are popular with young people, and at educational institutions. We need to inform people about this deadly trap that anyone can get into, frankly and harshly. We need to have the courage to tell the truth and expose lies, including those about the “safe and civilised” use of so-called light substances and other drugs.

I have already mentioned it more than once and I would like to repeat it again: charities and other public associations should be more vigorously involved in this work. Many of them already have successful experience in preventing drug addiction, and in helping the social rehabilitation of drug addicts. These practices should definitely be widely disseminated.

Sixth. I have already said that drugs are a global threat. This means we should make efforts to enhance international antidrug cooperation, primarily at prominent and influential platforms such as the United Nations, BRICS, CSTO, and SCO, and expand the exchange of information and experience in countering transnational, cross-border drug-related crime.

And there is one more point I would like to make in conclusion. I believe that the draft Russian State Antidrug Policy Strategy until 2030 certainly takes into account the nature of modern challenges and threats to national security. But you need to be extra careful about each of its provisions, not apply them formally. Let's discuss this document now. I want you to take this very, very seriously, both the document itself and the future implementation plans for this document. Now we need to look at its main provisions.

Russia,04-05-2018 00:00,Vladimir Putin,Meeting of the State Council on promoting competition,"Good afternoon, colleagues,

Today we hold the first meeting of the State Council after the presidential election.

You know what ambitious tasks the country has. They require that everyone engages in their solution as effectively as possible: the civil society, businesses and government bodies must work together. And, of course, the efforts of all the Russian regions are needed.

Promoting competition in Russia is the subject of our meeting. First of all, I would like to say that this is a key area of our work. We cannot do anything without solving tasks in this area; we cannot reach any goal.

Let me stress once again that the fundamental importance of the competition is determined by the Russian Constitution. As I have already said, this is one of the most important areas in order to reach the goals I listed in my Address to the Federal Assembly.

Fair and honest competition is a basic condition for economic and technological development as well as for the country to reform and dynamically advance in all fields of life.

Let me begin with regulations in this sphere. In general, they are in line with international standards. Recently we have approved four packages of antimonopoly laws. The main thing is to provide the corresponding legal precedents.

Unfortunately, there still are many cases when the competition law is ignored, especially by local authorities.

Let’s see what we have in practical terms. Of the total number of antimonopoly law infringements in 2017, 1.2 percent falls to federal authorities, and 98.8 percent, to regional and local authorities, which means Russia is not paying enough attention to this. We think this is some kind of nonsense, nothing serious; figuratively speaking, people must care about their companies, state unitary enterprises and municipal unitary enterprises. I will talk about this later.

To be quite frank with you, the damage to Russia’s economy is enormous. We cannot see or feel it, but it is huge.

Currently, the Federal Anti-Monopoly Service is developing the fifth legislative package. But in addition to the legislation, the managerial logic must change, too. I believe the most important task is to introduce pro-competition approaches in government agencies.

However, the approaches based on encouraging competition are very rarely used. The reason lies in a customary and long-standing bureaucratic mindset and the lack of commitment to building an economy of state or municipal procurement that would be beneficial to the region and its residents.

As I said, it is easier to work with local state and municipal unitary enterprises than select efficient contractors in the competition-based market. This practice leads to higher budgetary spending and preserves outdated production and low quality. Eventually, it affects consumers, Russian citizens.

It should be particularly noted that public and state-run companies are occupying the niches that could be taken by small and medium-sized businesses. They are forcing SMEs out of the markets and monopolising these markets. Therefore, cartels are growing in the industries with high competition; entrepreneurial initiative and motivation to open a business get undermined.

People believe they have little chance to succeed in the markets taken up by public and state-run companies; that it is difficult to win a state or municipal order through honest competition. Public and state-run companies have very different opportunities for lobbying and funding. They can access loans much easier. They also have instruments to turn tenders in their favour and we are aware of them.

For your information, in 2017 some 675 court cases on anti-competitive agreements were filed, including 360 cases on cartels. This is eight percent higher than in 2016. For the second year in a row, the construction industry is number one for this kind of violations.

We have discussed these problems many times. We have taken a number of decisions, specifically, those that would expand the access of small businesses and socially-oriented NGOs to state and municipal orders and services. Apparently, this is not enough. I would like to hear about the current state of affairs and what specific measures you plan to take.

It is also necessary to create a single register of state and municipal property with full information on rights to it, encumbrances and designated use and, while this work is in progress, to activate the identification of unrecorded or inefficiently used real estate and plots of land.

This subject has been discussed for a long time, but, unfortunately, there is no real progress here so far. In this regard, I propose to discuss in detail improving the efficiency of management of state and municipal property at one of the State Council meetings.

Since 2015, the regions have started to implement the competition development guidelines, approved by the Government. For a number of Russian regions, this has become a real incentive to support competition. This is so, we can see it. But in general, the country has no systemic changes for the better.

In December last year, an Executive Order was issued, which stipulated competition promotion as a priority for the authorities’ work, while the National Plan for 2018–2020 outlined specific industries and the targets of competition development in them.

I believe that the same subject areas need to be defined for each region – of course, this work should be carried out together with the regions, taking into account their specifics and capabilities. Thus, regional teams will have clear indicators as regards the creation of a competitive environment, as well as obligations to develop private enterprises in priority markets, including new ones, digital ones, and so on.

I would like to point out another important problem – the trend towards the development of so-called regional protectionism. The motives for such actions are clear: the regions try to create favourable conditions for local producers and to simplify their access to the market.

Meanwhile, I would like you all to hear it now: a local producer means a Russian producer, this is extremely important. But we can see regional protectionism even in those regions that are in the forefront and show good development results. This is absolutely unacceptable. I would like to draw your attention to this.

I agree that it is possible and necessary to use regional preferences for supporting business and thus to increase employment and incomes of residents and revenues of the budget. However, it is one thing when benefits are equally available for everyone but it’s another story all together when discriminatory restrictions are created for entrepreneurs from different regions or bans are imposed on the imports of goods.

This directly contradicts the principle of the unity of the country’s economic space. Such overprotection is distorting the competition environment.

I would like to add that having got hold of these artificial advantages such companies, and you understand this full well, will become less effective in the long term and will impose on you low quality goods or services for inflated prices.

I would like to make two important points in this context. First of all, each of our steps aimed at supporting industries, companies, including as part of the import replacement, should encourage the production of modern competitive goods and services that are in demand both on the domestic and international markets.

The second thing I would like to point out is that it is necessary to take a general look at the markets and consider the prospects of the demand to prevent exclusive terms for projects and investors in some regions from having an adverse effect on the development of successful similar companies in other regions of the Russian Federation.

It is necessary to search for and find a balance as well as ensure fair and equal competition. I am quite sure that everyone will have enough work if managers do their job properly.

Let me repeat that for a breakthrough in national development it is critical to ensure economic freedoms and a high level of competition. Very much depends on the state and all levels of the authorities. But, of course, business itself is playing an enormous role in forming the business climate, the ethics of entrepreneurship and the practice of fair competition.

It is clear that profit is the main priority for a business but it should not be gained at any price. You know why I am talking about this today and why responsibility of business to the people and society is so important. Entrepreneurs should work honestly and conscientiously. They should not be timeservers that are only worried about their own prosperity. We have huge tasks and goals lying ahead.

I believe the business community understands just how important its contribution to a breakthrough in national development is. And once again I would like to appeal to every single one of you: we cannot afford to waste any time!",President,Vladimir Putin,http://en.kremlin.ru/events/president/transcripts/statements/57205,,DEVELOPMENT
USA,23-09-2013,Barack Obama,"
Remarks by President Obama Before Bilateral Meeting with President Goodluck Jonathan of Nigeria","Well, I appreciate very much the opportunity to meet once again with President Jonathan and his delegation.  Obviously, Nigeria is one of the most powerful and fastest-growing countries in the world.  I think that's testified by the fact that President Jonathan is going to have the opportunity to ring the bell at the New York Stock Exchange.  (Laughter.)  I think it signifies how important Nigeria is becoming in the global economy.

We have a very strong relationship between the United States and Nigeria.  It’s not just based on government-to-government relations, but also people-to-people relations.  And we have an outstanding Nigerian-American community here in the United States that is making incredible contributions in every field every single day.

 President Jonathan has committed to building on the democratic process that we've seen in Nigeria in the past.  The last election that brought President Jonathan to power was a hallmark on the continent and in Nigeria in terms of free and fair elections.  And I know that he is committed to making sure that the elections in 2015 move in that same fashion.

We're going to be able to have an opportunity to talk about the issues of energy and power.  Nigeria is a major energy producer, but it’s also an important energy consumer.  And as many of you know who were on the trip that I took to Africa just recently, we are really focused on how we can help to bring electricity and power generation throughout Africa -- not just in the big cities but also in the rural areas, and Nigeria is a potential partner in that process.

 We want to develop the human capital throughout the continent and in Nigeria.  And that's why I'm excited about the Young African Leaders Initiative that is going to allow us to have young African leaders from across the continent, including

Nigeria, here in the United States where they can interact with top leaders here in our universities, our businesses, and that will further strengthen the ties between our two countries.

And we're going to have an opportunity to discuss some significant challenges on the security front in Nigeria.  In the northern regions of Nigeria we've seen the emergence of one of the most vicious terrorist organizations in the world -- the Boko Haram.  It presents an extraordinary security challenge for the people of Nigeria, and we want to be cooperative in that process of building capacity inside Nigeria to deal with that terrorist threat, but doing so in a way that is consistent with human rights.  Because we strongly believe that the best way to undermine the agenda of those who would do violence is to make sure that governments are responsive to the needs of people and following rule of law.

On that topic let me just make one last point.  I've had the opportunity to speak with President Kenyatta directly about the terrible tragedy that's happened in Nairobi, and we are providing all the cooperation that we can as we deal with a situation that has captivated the world.

I want to express personally my condolences to not only President Kenyatta, who lost some family members in the attack, but to the Kenyan people.  We stand with them against this terrible outrage that's occurred.  We will provide them with whatever law enforcement support that is necessary.  And we are confident that Kenya, which has been a pillar of stability in Eastern Africa, will rebuild.

But this I think underscores the degree to which all of us as an international community have to stand against the kind of senseless violence that these kinds of groups represent.  And the United States will continue to work with the entire continent of Africa and around the world to make sure that we are dismantling these networks of destruction.",President,Barack Obama,https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/the-press-office/2013/09/23/remarks-president-obama-bilateral-meeting-president-goodluck-jonathan-ni,,INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS
USA,20-09-2016,Barack Obama,"
Remarks by President Obama at Luncheon for Heads of State and Government","Good afternoon, everyone. And thank you, Mr. Secretary General, as always, for your kind words and your welcome. For eight years, this luncheon has followed a long speech by me. For eight years, it’s forced me to be brief and not subject you to a second long speech. And after eight years, I finally figured out the Secretary General’s plan. It keeps me brief and I will follow that plan here today.

My role is very simple. As President of the host country of the United Nations, it is my pleasure to welcome each and every one of you. The presence of so many world leaders in one place is always an enormous undertaking. New York City always rises to the occasion. And over the last few days this city has been tested again. And on behalf of all of us, I want to salute our police officers, our law enforcement officials, our first responders for hosting us, but also showing the world the true meaning of grit and resolve. So thank you again, New York City and the New York-New Jersey area. (Applause.)

As I said earlier today, even as we work to uphold our international system, it is the choices of individuals that decides whether our world is defined by confrontation or cooperation. So again today, I want to pay special tribute to those individuals who devote their lives to sustaining the system -- the men and women who staff the United Nations and its organizations; those in Syria and elsewhere who risk their lives to deliver aid to people in dire need; those who give their lives as peacekeepers. The entire world is in their debt.

And I would note, just as this morning was my last speech to the General Assembly as President, this will be my last toast at this luncheon. It will be the Secretary General’s as well. So I want to take this opportunity on behalf of all of us to say thank you, Mr. Secretary General, for your outstanding leadership of this institution and the example of your life. You’ve traveled a remarkable journey. Born in a village in South Korea, rising to the highest levels of global leadership. And it is a testimony to your courage and your optimism, your imagination, and your will.

We see your legacy in the new Sustainable Development Goals, your courageous defense of human rights, a reinvigorated peacekeeping structure, and the most ambitious agreement in history to fight climate change.

I should point out we’re not the only ones who are grateful for the Secretary General’s leadership. A village on the island of Samoa declared him officially a crown chief and prince -- (laughter) -- which I believe is a title that you can keep for life. There’s no term limit to that. (Laughter.)

So let me propose a toast: To the eighth Secretary General of the United Nations, who in his seventh decade still embodies what Robert Kennedy famously called the “qualities of youth” -- “not a time of life, but a state of mind, a temper of the will, a quality of the imagination, and a predominance of courage over timidity.” That aptly describes our Secretary General. We are grateful for his service. We are grateful to his team. The world is better for him. Cheers.

(A toast is offered.) (Applause.)",President,Barack Obama,https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/the-press-office/2016/09/20/remarks-president-obama-luncheon-heads-state-and-government,,INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS
USA,27-05-2013,Barack Obama,"
Remarks by the President Commemorating Memorial Day","Thank you.  (Applause.)  Please be seated.  Thank you very much.  Good morning, everybody.  I want to thank Secretary Chuck Hagel, not only for the introduction but, Chuck, for your lifetime of service -- from sergeant in the Army to Secretary of Defense, but always a man who carries with you the memory of friends and fallen heroes from Vietnam.  We’re grateful to you. 

I want to thank General Dempsey, Major General Linnington, Kathryn Condon, who has served Arlington with extraordinary  dedication and grace and who will be leaving us, but we are so grateful for the work that she’s done; for Chaplain Brainerd, Secretary Shinseki, all our guests.  And most of all, to members of our armed services and our veterans; to the families and friends of the fallen who we honor today; to Americans from all across the country who have come to pay your respects:  I have to say it is always a great honor to spend this Memorial Day with you at this sacred place where we honor our fallen heroes -- those who we remember fondly in our memories, and those known only to God.

Beyond these quiet hills, across that special bridge, is a city of monuments dedicated to visionary leaders and singular moments in the life of our Republic.  But it is here, on this hallowed ground, where we choose to build a monument to a constant thread in the American character -- the truth that our nation endures because it has always been home to men and women who are willing to give their all, and lay down their very lives, to preserve and protect this land that we love.

That character -- that selflessness -- beats in the hearts of the very first patriots who died for a democracy they had never known and would never see.  It lived on in the men and women who fought to hold our union together, and in those who fought to defend it abroad -- from the beaches of Europe to the mountains and jungles of Asia.  This year, as we mark the 60th anniversary of the end of fighting in Korea, we offer a special salute to all those who served and gave their lives in the Korean War.  And over the last decade, we’ve seen the character of our country again -- in the nearly 7,000 Americans who have made the ultimate sacrifice on battlefields and city streets half a world away.

Last Memorial Day, I stood here and spoke about how, for the first time in nine years, Americans were no longer fighting and dying in Iraq.  Today, a transition is underway in Afghanistan, and our troops are coming home.  Fewer Americans are making the ultimate sacrifice in Afghanistan, and that’s progress for which we are profoundly grateful.  And this time next year, we will mark the final Memorial Day of our war in Afghanistan. 

And so, as I said last week, America stands at a crossroads.  But even as we turn the page on a decade of conflict, even as we look forward, let us never forget, as we gather here today, that our nation is still at war.

It should be self-evident.  And in generations past, it was.  And during World War II, millions of Americans contributed to the war effort -- soldiers like my own grandfather; women like my grandmother, who worked the assembly lines.  During the Vietnam War, just about everybody knew somebody -- a brother, a son, a friend -- who served in harm’s way.

Today, it’s different.  Perhaps it’s a tribute to our remarkable all-volunteer force, made up of men and women who step forward to serve and do so with extraordinary skill and valor.  Perhaps it’s a testament to our advanced technologies, which allow smaller numbers of troops to wield greater and greater power.  But regardless of the reason, this truth cannot be ignored that today most Americans are not directly touched by war.

As a consequence, not all Americans may always see or fully grasp the depth of sacrifice, the profound costs that are made in our name -- right now, as we speak, every day.  Our troops and our military families understand this, and they mention to me their concern about whether the country fully appreciates what’s happening.  I think about a letter I received from a Naval officer, a reservist who had just returned from a deployment to Afghanistan.  And he wrote me, “I’m concerned that our work in Afghanistan is fading from memory.”  And he went on to ask that we do more to keep this conflict “alive and focused in the hearts and minds of our own people.”

And he’s right.  As we gather here today, at this very moment, more than 60,000 of our fellow Americans still serve far from home in Afghanistan.  They’re still going out on patrol, still living in spartan forward operating bases, still risking their lives to carry out their mission.  And when they give their lives, they are still being laid to rest in cemeteries in the quiet corners across our country, including here in Arlington.

Captain Sara Cullen had a smile that could light up a room and a love of country that led her to West Point.  And after graduation, Sara became a Black Hawk pilot -- and married a former Black Hawk pilot.  She was just 27 years old when she and four other soldiers were killed in a helicopter crash during a training mission near Kandahar.  This past April, Sara was laid to rest here, in Section 60.  Today, Sara is remembered by her mother, Lynn, who says she is “proud of her daughter’s life, proud of her faith and proud of her service to our country.”  (Applause.)

Staff Sergeant Frankie Phillips came from a military family and was as tough as they come.  A combat medic, Frankie was on patrol in Afghanistan three weeks ago when his vehicle was hit by a roadside bomb.  He was so humble that his parents never knew how many lives he had saved until soldiers started showing up at his funeral from thousands of miles away.  And last week, Frankie was laid to rest just a few rows over from Sara. 

Staff Sergeant Eric Christian was a born leader.  A member of the Marine Corps Special Operations Command, Eric had served five tours of duty, but kept going back because he felt responsible for his teammates and was determined to finish the mission.  On May 4th, Eric gave his life after escorting a high-ranking U.S. official to meet with Afghan leaders.  Later, his family got a letter from a Marine who had served two tours with Eric.  In it, the Marine wrote, “There were people who measured their success based on how many enemies they killed or how many missions they led to conquer a foe.  Eric based his success on how many of his friends he brought home, and he brought home many -- including me.”  Eric was laid to rest here at Arlington, just six days ago.  (Applause.)

So today, we remember their service.  Today, just steps from where these brave Americans lie in eternal peace, we declare, as a proud and grateful nation, that their sacrifice will never be forgotten.  And just as we honor them, we hold their families close.  Because for the parents who lose a child; for the husbands and wives who lose a partner; for the children who lose a parent, every loss is devastating.  And for those of us who bear the solemn responsibility of sending these men and women into harm’s way, we know the consequences all too well.  I feel it every time I meet a wounded warrior, every time I visit Walter Reed, and every time I grieve with a Gold Star family. 

And that’s why, on this day, we remember our sacred obligation to those who laid down their lives so we could live ours:  to finish the job these men and women started by keeping our promise to those who wear America’s uniform -- to give our troops the resources they need; to keep faith with our veterans and their families, now and always; to never stop searching for those who have gone missing or who are held as prisoners of war. 

But on a more basic level, every American can do something even simpler.  As we go about our daily lives, we must remember that our countrymen are still serving, still fighting, still putting their lives on the line for all of us. 

Last fall, I received a letter from Candie Averette, of Charlotte, North Carolina.  Both of her sons are Marines.  Her oldest served two tours in Iraq.  Her youngest was in Afghanistan at the time.  He was, in her words, “100 percent devoted to his deployment and wouldn’t have had it any other way.”

Reading Candie’s letter, it was clear she was extraordinarily proud of the life her boys had chosen.  But she also had a request on behalf of all the mothers just like her.  She said, “Please don’t forget about my child and every other Marine and soldier over there who proudly choose to defend their country.” 

A mother’s plea -- please don’t forget.  On this Memorial Day, and every day, let us be true and meet that promise.  Let it be our task, every single one of us, to honor the strength and the resolve and the love these brave Americans felt for each other and for our country.  Let us never forget to always remember and to be worthy of the sacrifice they make in our name. 

May God bless the fallen and all those who serve.  And may God continue to bless the United States of America.  (Applause.) ",President,Barack Obama,https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/the-press-office/2013/05/27/remarks-president-commemorating-memorial-day,,OTHERS
USA,30-08-2021 00:00,Joe Biden,Statement by President Joe Biden,"I want to thank our commanders and the men and women serving under them for their execution of the dangerous retrograde from Afghanistan as scheduled – in the early morning hours of August 31, Kabul time – with no further loss of American lives. The past 17 days have seen our troops execute the largest airlift in US history, evacuating over 120,000 US citizens, citizens of our allies, and Afghan allies of the United States. They have done it with unmatched courage, professionalism, and resolve. Now, our 20-year military presence in Afghanistan has ended.

Tomorrow afternoon, I will address the American people on my decision not to extend our presence in Afghanistan beyond August 31. For now, I will report that it was the unanimous recommendation of the Joint Chiefs and of all of our commanders on the ground to end our airlift mission as planned. Their view was that ending our military mission was the best way to protect the lives of our troops, and secure the prospects of civilian departures for those who want to leave Afghanistan in the weeks and months ahead.

I have asked the Secretary of State to lead the continued coordination with our international partners to ensure safe passage for any Americans, Afghan partners, and foreign nationals who want to leave Afghanistan. This will include work to build on the UN Security Council Resolution passed this afternoon that sent the clear message of what the international community expects the Taliban to deliver on moving forward, notably freedom of travel. The Taliban has made commitments on safe passage and the world will hold them to their commitments. It will include ongoing diplomacy in Afghanistan and coordination with partners in the region to reopen the airport allowing for continued departure for those who want to leave and delivery of humanitarian assistance to the people of Afghanistan.

For now, I urge all Americans to join me in grateful prayer tonight for three things. First, for our troops and diplomats who carried out this mission of mercy in Kabul and at tremendous risk with such unparalleled results: an airlift that evacuated tens of thousands more people than any imagined possible. Second, to the network of volunteers and veterans who helped identify those needing evacuation, guide them to the airport, and provide support along the way. And third, to everyone who is now – and who will – welcome our Afghan allies to their new homes around the world, and in the United States.

Finally, I want to end with a moment of gratitude for the sacrifice of the 13 service members in Afghanistan who gave their lives last week to save tens of thousands: Marine Corps Staff Sgt. Darin T. Hoover, Marine Corps Sgt. Johanny Rosariopichardo, Marine Corps Sgt. Nicole L. Gee, Marine Corps Cpl. Hunter Lopez, Marine Corps Cpl. Daegan W. Page, Marine Corps Cpl. Humberto A.

USA,18-03-2021 00:00,Joe Biden,Statement by President Biden on the Farm Workforce Modernization Act of 2021,"Farmworkers are vital to the wellbeing of our country and our economy. For generations, America’s farmworkers – many of whom are undocumented – have worked countless hours to feed our nation and ensure our communities are healthy and strong. This has been even more clear and crucial during the COVID-19 pandemic, as farmworkers have put their lives and the lives of their loved ones on the line to ensure that families across the country have food on the table.

This is why I support the Farm Workforce Modernization Act of 2021 and celebrate its passage. The Act will deliver the lawful status and better working conditions that this critical workforce deserves, as well as much needed stability for farmers, growers, and the entire agriculture industry.

My Administration is ready to work with leaders on both sides of the aisle to address the needs of our essential workers, bring greater dignity and security to our agricultural sector, and finally enact the long-term solutions we need to create a safe, orderly, and humane immigration system, in addition to tackling the root causes of migration to the United States.",President,Joe Biden,https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/03/18/statement-by-president-biden-on-the-farm-workforce-modernization-act-of-2021/,,OTHERS
Russia,17-11-2015,Vladimir Putin,Meeting on investigation into the crash of a Russian airliner over Sinai,"Let’s once again pay tribute to the crash victims.

A minute of silence.

This is not the first time Russia experiences barbaric terrorist crime, usually without any obvious internal or external causes, the way it was with the explosion at the railway station in Volgograd at the end of 2013. We remember everything and everyone.

The murder of our people over Sinai is one of the bloodiest crimes in terms of the lives it claimed. We will not dry our tears – this will remain forever in our hearts and minds. However, this would not stop us from finding and punishing the perpetrators.

We have to do it without any period of limitation; we need to know all their names. We will search wherever they may be hiding. We will find them anywhere on the planet and punish them.

In these efforts, we need to rely on people who share the moral values that lie at the basis of our policy, in this case our foreign and security policy, our counterterrorism policy.

Our aviation should not simply continue military operations in Syria, but enhance them so as to make it clear to the criminals that vengeance is inevitable.

I would like to ask the Defence Ministry and the General Staff to make their proposals. I will check the progress of this work.

I would like the Russian Foreign Ministry to turn to all our partners. We rely on all our friends in these efforts, including our search for and punishment of the perpetrators.

We will act in compliance with Article 51 of the United Nations Charter, which envisages the right of a state to self-defence.

Whoever tries to help the perpetrators ought to know that they would bear full responsibility for any attempts to harbour them.

I would like all our special services to focus on this work.",President,Vladimir Putin,http://en.kremlin.ru/events/president/transcripts/statements/50707,,EXTREMISM
USA,28-10-2021 00:00,Joe Biden,"Statement by President Joseph R. Biden, Jr. on the International Response to Events in Sudan","Leaders and organizations from around the world, including the African Union, Arab League, European Union, International Monetary Fund, Organization of Islamic Cooperation, and World Bank have come together to condemn the military takeover in Sudan and violence against peaceful demonstrators.  Today, the UN Security Council added its voice to this international chorus.  Together, our message to Sudan’s military authorities is overwhelming and clear: the Sudanese people must be allowed to protest peacefully and the civilian-led transitional government must be restored. 
 
I urge Sudan’s military leaders to immediately release all those detained and restore the institutions associated with the transitional government, in line with the 2019 Constitutional Declaration and the 2020 Juba Peace Agreement.  Then, with the support of the international community, I believe all parties in Sudan can reclaim a shared vision for completing Sudan’s transition to democracy. The United States is committed to helping the Sudanese people achieve this goal.  We believe strongly in Sudan’s economic potential and the promise of its future—if the military and those who oppose change do not hold it back.  
 
I have admired the courage of the Sudanese people in demanding their voices be heard and helping their country make strides toward a new, democratic Sudan.  The events of recent days are a grave setback, but the United States will continue to stand with the people of Sudan and their non-violent struggle to advance the goals of Sudan’s revolution.  Freedom, equality, government under rule of law, and respect for human rights must be the foundation for future security and prosperity in Sudan, just as they are all around the world.",President,Joe Biden,https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/10/28/statement-by-president-joseph-r-biden-jr-on-the-international-response-to-events-in-sudan/,,INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS
USA,03-07-2014,Barack Obama,"
Remarks by the President on the Economy","So we're going into the 4th of July weekend and what more appropriate place to be than 1776.  (Applause.)   This is an incubator for all sorts of tech startups, a lot of them focused on social change issues, on education, on health care.  And so we've got a range of entrepreneurs who are trying to figure out how can we do well by doing good, in many cases. 

And I just have to say that the young people -- and some not so young people -- (laughter) -- that I spoke to, coming from a wide range of backgrounds -- we had former Army Rangers; we had lawyers; we had former HR folks, transportation experts, engineers -- all of them had the kind of energy and drive and creativity and innovation that has been the hallmark of the American economy.

And part of the reason I wanted to come here today is to focus on what’s happened in the U.S. economy over the last several months and last several years.  We just got a jobs report today showing that we've now seen the fastest job growth in the United States in the first half of the year since 1999.  (Applause.)  So this is also the first time we've seen five consecutive months of job growth over 200,000 since 1999.  (Applause.)  And we've seen the quickest drop in unemployment in 30 years. 

So it gives you a sense that the economy has built momentum, that we are making progress.  We've now seen almost 10 million jobs created over the course of the last 52 months.  And it should be a useful reminder to people all across the country that given where we started back in 2008, we have made enormous strides, thanks to the incredible hard work of the American people and American businesses that have been out there competing, getting smarter, getting more effective.  And it's making a difference all across the country.

Now, what we also know is, as much progress as has been made, there are still folks out there who are struggling.  We still have not seen as much increase in income and wages as we’d like to see.  A lot of folks are still digging themselves out of challenges that arose out of the Great Recession. 

Historically, financial crises take a longer time to recover from.  We've done better than the vast majority of other countries over the last five years, but that drag has still meant a lot of hardship for a lot of folks.  And so it’s really important for us to understand that we could be making even stronger process, we could be growing even more jobs, we could be creating even more business opportunities for smart, talented folks like these if those of us here in Washington were focused on them, focused on you, the American people, rather than focused on politics. 

And I’ve given a number of examples over the last several months of things we know would work if we are investing in rebuilding our infrastructure -- that doesn’t just put construction workers back to work, that puts engineers back to work, that puts landscape architects back to work, it puts folks who are manufacturing concrete or steel back to work.  It makes a difference and it has huge ripple effects all across the economy.

If we are serious about increasing the minimum wage, that puts more money in the pockets of people who are most likely to spend it.  They, in turn, are most likely to hire more people because they now have more customers who are frequenting their businesses.  If we are making sure that there’s equal pay for equal work, that’s helping families all across the country.  If we’re focused on making sure that childcare is accessible and affordable and high-quality, that frees up a whole bunch of potential entrepreneurs, as well as people who are just going to work every single day, doing the right thing, being responsible, but often are hampered by difficult situations in terms of trying to manage parenting and families.

And so there are just a series of specific things we can do right now -- many of them I’m doing on my own because we have the administrative authority to do it, but some of them we can’t do without Congress.  We can’t fix a broken immigration system that would allow incredibly talented folks who want to start businesses here and create jobs here in the United States, would allow them to stay and make those investments.  That’s something that we need Congress to help us on.  (Applause.)  We’re not going to be able to fund the Highway Trust Fund and to ramp up our investment in infrastructure without acts of Congress.

So my hope is, is the American people look at today’s news and understand that, in fact, we are making strides.  We have not seen more consistent job growth since the ‘90s.  But we can make even more progress if Congress is willing to work with my administration and to set politics aside, at least occasionally -- (laughter) -- which I know is what the American people are urgently looking for.

It’s a sort of economic patriotism where you say to yourself, how is it that we can start rebuilding this country to make sure that all of the young people who are here but their kids and their grandkids are going to be able to enjoy the same incredible opportunities that this country offers as we have.  That’s our job.  That’s what we should be focused on.  And it’s worth remembering as we go into Independence Day.

Thanks, everybody.  Appreciate it.  Thanks.  (Applause.)",President,Barack Obama,https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/the-press-office/2014/07/03/remarks-president-economy,,DEVELOPMENT
USA,24-11-2021 00:00,Joe Biden,Statement from President Joe Biden,"Ahmaud Arbery’s killing – witnessed by the world on video – is a devastating reminder of how far we have to go in the fight for racial justice in this country.

United Kingdom,19-Nov-20,Boris Johnson,PM statement to the House on the Integrated Review: 19 November 2020,"Mr Speaker, thank you and with permission, I will update the House on the Government’s Integrated Review of foreign, defence, security and development policy. Our Review will conclude early next year, setting out the UK’s international agenda, but I want to inform the House of its first outcome. For decades, British governments have trimmed and cheese-pared our defence budget and if we go on like this, we risk waking up to discover that our armed forces – the pride of Britain – have fallen below the minimum threshold of viability, and once lost, they could never be regained. That outcome would not only be craven, it would jeopardise the security of the British people, amounting to a dereliction of duty for any Prime Minister. So I refused to vindicate any pessimistic forecasters there have been by taking up the scalpel yet again. Based on our assessment of the international situation and our foreign policy goals, I have decided that the era of cutting our defence budget must end – and it ends now. I am increasing defence spending by £24.1 billion over the next four years, That’s £16.5 billion more than our manifesto commitment - raising it as a share of GDP to at least 2.2 percent, exceeding our NATO pledge, and investing £190 billion over the next four years, more than any other European country and more than any other NATO ally, except the United States. The Ministry of Defence has received a multi-year settlement because equipping our armed forces requires long term investment, and our national security in 20 years’ time will depend on decisions we take today. I have done this in the teeth of the pandemic, amid every other demand on our resources, because the defence of the realm, and the safety of the British people, must come first. I pay tribute to my Right Honourable Friends the Chancellor and Defence Secretary, who believe in this as fervently as I do. Reviving our armed forces is one pillar of the Government’s ambition to safeguard Britain’s interests and values by strengthening our global influence, and reinforcing our ability to join the United States and our other allies to defend free and open societies. The international situation is now more perilous and intensely competitive than at any time since the Cold War. Everything we do in this country – every job, every business, even how we shop and what we eat – depends on a basic minimum of global security. Our people are sustained by a web of lifelines, oxygen pipes that must be kept open open shipping lanes, a functioning internet, safe air corridors, reliable undersea cables, and tranquillity in distant straits. This pandemic has offered a taste of what happens when elemental requirements are suddenly in question. We could take all this for granted, ignore the threat of terrorism and the ambitions of hostile states, and hope for the best, and we might get away with it for a while, before calamity strikes, as it surely would. Or we could accept that our lifelines must be protected, but we are content to curl up in our island and leave the task to our friends. My starting point is that either of those options would be an abdication of the first duty of Government to defend our people. My choice – and I hope it will carry every member of this House – is that Britain must be true to our history, To stand alongside our allies, sharing the burden and bringing our expertise to bear on the world’s toughest problems. To achieve this, we need to upgrade our capabilities across the board. We have already united our international effort into a new department combining aid and diplomacy, Led with grit and purpose by my RH Friend the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Secretary. Next year will be a year of British leadership, when we preside over the G7, host COP-26 in Glasgow and celebrate the 75th anniversary of the first United Nations General Assembly in London. We are leading the world towards net zero with our ten-point plan for a Green Industrial Revolution, and we are campaigning for our values, particularly freedom of religion and the media, and giving every girl in the world access to 12 years of quality education. But extending British influence requires a once-in-a-generation modernisation of our armed forces, and now is the right time to press ahead because emerging technologies, visible on the horizon, will make the returns from defence investment infinitely greater. We have a chance to break free from the vicious circle, whereby we ordered ever-decreasing numbers of ever more expensive items of military hardware, squandering billions along the way. The latest advances will multiply the fighting power of every warship, aircraft and infantry unit many times over, and the prizes will go to the swiftest and most agile nations, not necessarily the biggest. We can achieve as much as British ingenuity and expertise allow. We will need to act speedily to remove or reduce less relevant capabilities – and this will allow our new investment to be focused on the technologies that will revolutionise warfare, forging our military assets into a single network designed to overcome the enemy. A soldier in hostile territory will be alerted to a distant ambush by sensors on satellites or drones, instantly transmitting a warning, using Artificial Intelligence to devise the optimal response, and offering an array of options, from summoning an air strike to ordering a swarm attack, by drones or paralysing the enemy with cyber weapons. New advances will surmount the old limits of logistics. Our warships and combat vehicles will carry “directed energy weapons”, destroying targets with inexhaustible lasers and for them the phrase “out of ammunition” will become redundant. Nations are racing to master this new doctrine of warfare and our investment is designed to place Britain among the winners. The returns will go far beyond our Armed Forces. From aerospace to autonomous vehicles, these technologies have a vast array of civilian applications, opening up new vistas of economic progress, creating 10,000 jobs every year – 40,000 in total - levelling up across our country and reinforcing our Union. We shall use our extra defence spending to restore Britain’s position as the foremost naval power in Europe, taking forward our plans for eight Type 26 and five Type 31 frigates, and support ships to supply our carriers. We are going to develop the next generation of warships, including multi-role research vessels and Type 32 frigates. And this will spur a renaissance of British shipbuilding across the UK – in Glasgow and Rosyth, Belfast, Appledore and Birkenhead – guaranteeing jobs and illuminating the benefits of the Union in the white light of the arc welder’s torch. If there was one policy which strengthens the UK in every possible sense, it is building more ships for the Royal Navy. Once both of our carriers are operational in 2023, the UK will have a Carrier Strike Group permanently available, routinely deployed globally and always ready to fight alongside NATO and other allies. Next year HMS Queen Elizabeth will lead a British and allied task group on our most ambitious deployment for two decades, encompassing the Mediterranean, the Indian Ocean and East Asia. We shall forward deploy more of our naval assets in the world’s most important regions, protecting the shipping lanes that supply our nation, and we shall press on with renewing our nuclear deterrent. We shall reshape our army for the age of networked warfare, allowing better equipped soldiers to deploy more quickly, and strengthening the ability of our Special Forces to operate covertly against our most sophisticated adversaries. Our security and intelligence agencies will continue to protect us around the clock from terrorism and new and evolving threats, We shall invest another £1.5 billion in military research and development, designed to master the new technologies of warfare, and we will establish a new centre dedicated to Artificial Intelligence and a new RAF Space Command, launching British satellites and our first rocket from Scotland in 2022. I can announce that we have established a National Cyber Force, combining our intelligence agencies and service personnel, which is already operating in cyberspace against terrorism, organised crime and hostile state activity. And the RAF will receive a new fighter system, harnessing Artificial Intelligence and drone technology to defeat any adversary in air-to-air combat. Our plans will safeguard hundreds of thousands of jobs in the defence industry, protecting livelihoods across the UK and keeping the British people safe. The defence of the realm is above party politics and we all take pride in how British resolve saved democracy in 1940, and British internationalism – directed by Clement Attlee - helped to create NATO and preserve peace through the Cold War. The wisdom and pragmatism of Margaret Thatcher found a path out of confrontation when she met Mikhail Gorbachev in 1984. In each case, Britain tipped the scales of history and did immense good for the world. Now we have a chance to follow in this great tradition, to end the era of retreat, transform our armed forces, bolster our global influence, unite and level up across our country, protect our people, and defend the free societies in which we fervently believe.

USA,13-02-2021 00:00,Joe Biden,Statement by President Joe Biden on the Senate Vote in the Trial of Donald Trump,"It was nearly two weeks ago that Jill and I paid our respects to Capitol Police officer Brian Sicknick, who laid in honor in the Rotunda after losing his life protecting the Capitol from a riotous, violent mob on January 6, 2021.

Today, 57 Senators – including a record 7 Republicans – voted to find former President Trump guilty for inciting that deadly insurrection on our very democracy. The Senate vote followed the bipartisan vote to impeach him by the House of Representatives. While the final vote did not lead to a conviction, the substance of the charge is not in dispute. Even those opposed to the conviction, like Senate Minority Leader McConnell, believe Donald Trump was guilty of a “disgraceful dereliction of duty” and “practically and morally responsible for provoking” the violence unleashed on the Capitol.

Tonight, I am thinking about those who bravely stood guard that January day. I’m thinking about all those who lost their lives, all those whose lives were threatened, and all those who are still today living with terror they lived through that day. And I’m thinking of those who demonstrated the courage to protect the integrity of our democracy – Democrats and Republicans, election officials and judges, elected representatives and poll workers – before and after the election. 

This sad chapter in our history has reminded us that democracy is fragile. That it must always be defended. That we must be ever vigilant. That violence and extremism has no place in America. And that each of us has a duty and responsibility as Americans, and especially as leaders, to defend the truth and to defeat the lies.

That is how we end this uncivil war and heal the very soul of our nation. That is the task ahead. And it’s a task we must undertake together. As the United States of America.

Russia,12-06-2006 00:00,Vladimir Putin,Opening Remarks at Meeting with Leaders of Political Parties,"Good afternoon, colleagues,

This is the first time we are meeting in this format, and we are doing so because the subject that I propose we discuss today is of vital importance for all of us, for society in general and for our entire nation.

The subject of our attention today is extremism and what we can do to combat it. Many countries, including Russia, face this problem. I am referring primarily to terrorism, but also to all attempts to incite racial, ethnic, religious or social hatred and division through the use of violence or appeals to violence.

Combating and preventing extremism is not just a task for the state alone, although the state must take the lead in reacting to these kinds of issues. But the state cannot combat these problems effectively on its own. This combat calls for a concerted effort by all the political parties, all the various public organisations, our entire civil society and all of our citizens. It is for this reason that today’s meeting has become necessary.

Extremism, as we know, has many different faces. The various forms it takes – from acts of hooliganism to acts of vandalism and violence – generally have their roots in ideology based on xenophobia, ethnic and religious intolerance. We are all well aware that any form of extremism represents a grave danger.

The fact that materials propagandising hatred and division are so easily accessible today is of particular concern. They are easily found in bookshops, and not only bookshops, and that’s not to mention how easy it is to get access to them on the Internet. And it is our young people who are the ones most often reading and using these materials.

As you know, Russia has a federal law on the prevention of extremist activity, but there are still gaps in the law and not all our efforts to fight extremism are effective. Furthermore, we must ensure that our laws in this area are absolutely clear in their formulation and that the punishments they stipulate are certain to be imposed and are commensurate with the acts committed.

It is essential that we organise active educational work in the regions, the aim of which will be to explain clearly why extremism is a danger for the state, for society as a whole, and for each individual citizen.

This kind of activity is a task the political parties, which have an organisational network throughout the country and are in constant contact with people, could take on.

Another issue that we can only resolve through collective effort is maintaining social and political stability during election periods, given the elections to the State Duma in 2007, and also elections to regional parliaments. Elections to regional parliaments will take place in fourteen different Russian regions next March.

As you know, the current electoral laws contain serious legal barriers that make it possible to prevent extremist organisations taking part in elections. The revised law on political parties that contains provisions on their ideological and financial transparency will also help to screen out extremist groups. I would like to thank the current Duma deputies for passing these laws. I think that these were timely decisions and the right steps to take.

But, as we know, election periods naturally enough see a battle to win over voters, and this situation can give rise to the danger of overstepping the fragile line between raising and speaking out frankly on issues, and extremism. We have already seen such examples. Political parties therefore have a much greater responsibility to help maintain social stability during election periods.

All those who preach racial, ethnic or religious hatred must know that their views will meet with fitting resistance. And further, Russia’s multiethnic and religiously diverse society must know and feel at all times that the nation’s political parties have a clear and united position on this issue.

Dear colleagues,

I have outlined what I see as the most important issues for discussion. I am sure you have additional points to make, though I do not want to see us stray too far from the main subject of our discussion, and I am sure you also have your own ideas of possible solutions.",President,Vladimir Putin,http://en.kremlin.ru/events/president/transcripts/statements/23941,,EXTREMISM
China,25-06-2021 00:00,H.E. Wang Yi,A New Journey Ahead after Fifty Extraordinary Years,"Colleagues,
Friends,

Welcome to the Lanting Forum to join us in commemorating the 50th anniversary of the restoration of China's lawful seat in the United Nations.

The founding of the UN was a milestone in humanity's pursuit of peace and development. China was the first country to put its signature on the UN Charter. With an ink brush, the Chinese delegate solemnly left China's eternal imprint.

The People's Republic of China, since its founding, was kept out of the UN for 22 years. In spite of this, the Chinese people never wavered in their will to safeguard world peace. They never halted their efforts for common development. And they won support from more and more countries and peoples.

On 25 October 1971, the UN General Assembly at its 26th Session adopted Resolution 2758 with an overwhelming majority. It decides to restore all its rights to the People's Republic of China and to recognize the representatives of its Government as the only legitimate representatives of China to the United Nations. It was a victory for New China's diplomacy, a victory for justice and fairness in the world, and a victory for the purposes and principles of the UN Charter. With this historic event, the Chinese people, accounting for one-fourth of the world population, were able to stand proud in the family of nations. With this historic event, the UN truly became the most representative and authoritative international organization. The force for world peace and development was stronger than ever before.

As you all know, UNGA Resolution 2758 was based on a draft resolution jointly proposed by Albania, Algeria and 21 other countries. It was endorsed and supported by most countries. When it was adopted, many delegates from Asia, Africa and Latin America expressed their joy with cheers, applause and hugs. Ambassador Salim Ahmed Salim, then Tanzanian Permanent Representative to the UN, danced in the hall, wearing a Chinese-style suit. That memorable scene is as touching today as it was 50 years ago. Seated among us in this room today are ambassadors from many countries that co-sponsored and supported Resolution 2758. Let's give a round of warm applause to these countries. We appreciate and salute your act of justice!

Chairman Mao Zedong once said, it was our fellow developing countries that ""carried"" the People's Republic of China into the United Nations. The word ""carry"" aptly captures the profound friendship between China and other developing countries. This is something that we in China will never forget. In the five decades since, China has acted in the same spirit by firmly upholding the legitimate rights and interests of fellow developing countries and speaking up for the developing world. Past, present and in the future, China always stands together with developing countries. China's vote in the United Nations is always for the well-being of developing countries and for justice in the world. Keeping to the spirit of ""carry"", we will continue to strive for the collective rise of developing countries and make it a defining trend of the 21st century.

Colleagues,

Friends,

The past 50 years were full of ups and downs. But China always stays true to its original aspiration.

As the world's largest developing country and a permanent member of the UN Security Council, China always honors the purposes and principles of the UN Charter, and vigorously promotes the spirit and approach of multilateralism. It has made tireless efforts and important contributions to development and progress of mankind.

Today, we have invited some special guests. Ambassador Li Daoyu, who has devoted many years of his life to multilateral diplomacy, was awarded the national honorary title ""outstanding contributor to diplomatic work"". Ambassador Shi Yanhua, a member of the Chinese delegation to the 26th Session of the UNGA, witnessed in person the historic moment of China's return to the UN. I also acknowledge representatives of those who have done great service to the UN peacekeeping missions, to international poverty alleviation, and to medical and health undertakings. Let's give them our warmest welcome!

Over the past 50 years, many Chinese people have been involved in the UN's undertakings, and have witnessed, participated in and contributed to China's cooperation with the UN. They all have their own ""UN stories"" to tell. Put together, those stories epitomize the unremitting efforts of the Chinese people for a stronger UN and the important contribution of the Chinese nation to fulfilling the aspirations of the UN.

- China has set a good example in upholding the international order. Strongly committed to democracy, rule of law and equity in international relations, China put forth the five principles of peaceful co-existence as early as in the 1950s, and has since faithfully observed them, contributing significantly to the formulation and development of the basic norms governing international relations.

Over the past five decades, China has joined almost all universal inter-governmental organizations, signed more than 600 international conventions, earnestly fulfilled its international obligations, and honored its international commitments. Over the past five decades, holding high the banner of multilateralism, China has firmly safeguarded the UN-centered international system, upheld the international order underpinned by international law, and bolstered the central role of the United Nations in international affairs.

The past 50 years have seen Chinese leaders taking the stage at the UN many times. From the Three Worlds Theory to the proposal for a new international political and economic order, from building a harmonious world to a community with a shared future for mankind, China has shared its wisdom and solution for world peace and development at every historical moment.

President Xi Jinping, with his vision for greater progress of humanity, has proposed building a community with a shared future for mankind. This major initiative rises above differences in social system and development stage, and rejects the zero-sum mentality and geopolitical calculations. It sets the common goal for different countries, different nations and different civilizations. The initiative is the banner of major-country diplomacy with Chinese characteristics in the new era. China will continue to take an active part in the reform and improvement of the global governance system under this banner.

- China has honored its responsibilities for upholding world peace. Having participated in 29 UN peacekeeping operations and sent a total of over 50,000 peacekeepers, China has become the largest contributor of peacekeepers among the permanent members of the Security Council. We are also the second largest funding contributor to the UN and UN peacekeeping operations. To date, 24 Chinese military and police officers have given their lives in the line of duty. Their sacrifice will always be remembered. At this very moment, more than 2,400 Chinese peacekeepers are on duty across the globe. China has also set up a standby force of 8,000 troops and a police squad of 300 for UN peacekeeping missions. They are ready to go anytime when needed to safeguard world peace.

Over the past 50 years, China has taken the side of fairness, upholding sovereign equality and opposing interference in other countries' internal affairs, power politics and hegemonism. China has taken the side of justice, adhering to equity and impartiality and opposing geopolitical rivalry and exclusive blocs. China has taken the side of peace, standing for political settlement and opposing the use of force and unilateral sanctions. As a permanent member of the Security Council, China has been actively exploring for solutions to hotspot issues in line with the spirit of the UN Charter.

Last month, amid the worst conflict between Palestine and Israel since 2014, China, as the Security Council's rotating president, worked with other member states to hold five Security Council deliberations on the Palestinian issue, and released a press statement. China has called upon all parties to fully adhere to the ceasefire, provide humanitarian assistance to Palestine, and strive for an early, comprehensive, just and enduring settlement of the Palestinian issue on the basis of the two-state solution.

- China has worked relentlessly to promote common development. As the largest developing country, China was among the first to reach the UN Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). China has met 10 years in advance the poverty eradication target set out in the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, reducing the world's poverty-stricken population by over 70%.

As the world's second largest economy, China's contribution to global growth remained the highest for 15 years running. China has worked to foster greater synergy between its own development and that of the world. The Belt and Road Initiative has received support from 140 countries and 32 international organizations. The China International Import Expo, one that enables China to further open up to the world, has been held for three consecutive years. China also takes an active part in South-South cooperation. Under this framework, we have provided around RMB 400 billion yuan of development assistance to 166 countries and international organizations, and have built close to 3,000 complete projects. We have sent more than 600,000 aid workers to help over 120 developing countries with their efforts to achieve MDGs. In collaboration with the UNDP, China has also set up the International Poverty Reduction Center in China. The Center has run targeted training courses for poverty reduction workers from 136 countries and international organizations. It is China's contribution of intellectual and material resources to global efforts against poverty.

- China has made active contribution to addressing global challenges. On climate change, China has worked actively for the adoption of the Paris Agreement and has remained a firm supporter to it, and has facilitated solutions to environmental protection and sustainable development. At the General Debate of the 75th Session of the UN General Assembly, President Xi Jinping announced that China will strive to peak its CO2 emissions before 2030 and achieve carbon neutrality before 2060. Later at the Climate Ambition Summit, President Xi put forth more steps to scale up China's nationally determined contributions, testifying to China's sense of mission and responsibility.

When the Asian financial crisis broke out in 1997, China's commitment of not letting the RMB depreciate served our neighboring economies well in navigating the crisis. In the wake of the 2008 financial crisis, our responsible macroeconomic policies was an important contribution to world economic recovery. In recent years in particular, China absorbed 25 percent of the total exports from least developed countries. Under the G20 Debt Service Suspension Initiative, China has put off more loan repayments than other countries. All these are concrete steps to narrow the North-South gap.

In the global fight against COVID-19, we have launched as promptly as possible an emergency humanitarian operation, and have provided medical supplies to over 150 countries and 13 international organizations. President Xi Jinping has solemnly announced that Chinese vaccines will be made a global public good, and that China will be committed to ensuring accessibility and affordability of vaccines in developing countries. To date, China has provided 438 million doses of Chinese vaccines and raw ingredients to over 90 countries and international organizations. At the Global Health Summit last month, President Xi announced the major steps China will take to support international efforts to defeat the virus, sending once again China's strong message of solidarity to the world.

Colleagues,

Friends,

Tomorrow is the UN Charter Day. With the international landscape undergoing profound changes unseen in a century, how can we, the countries in the world, avoid division, reject confrontation, maintain solidarity, and advance cooperation? There is only one right answer: upholding the international system with the UN at its core and safeguarding the basic norms governing international relations based on the purposes and principles of the UN Charter. This is because that is the only system jointly built by all, and that is the only set of norms universally endorsed by all. Building international consensus on the UN platform to meet global challenges together is the biggest common ground of all countries. It is also the right choice consistent with the trend of the times.

We are ready to work with all countries to resolve differences through dialogue and negotiation, settle disputes through political ways, advance democracy and the rule of law in international relations, and jointly build a world of lasting peace.

We are ready to work with all countries to uphold the new vision of common, comprehensive, cooperative and sustainable security, combat non-traditional security threats, promote modernization of global governance capacity and system, and jointly build a world of universal security.

We are ready to work with all countries to enhance solidarity and win-win cooperation, provide more global public good to developing countries, work for a steady post-COVID world economic recovery, speed up the implementation of the 2030 Sustainable Development Agenda, and jointly build a world of shared prosperity.

We are ready to work with all countries to treat each other with respect and as equals, respect countries' own choice of social system and development path in light of national conditions, uphold diversity of the world, advance mutual learning among civilizations, and jointly build an open and inclusive world.

We are ready to work with all countries to uphold the people-centered approach and green development, implement the Paris Agreement on climate change, steadily strengthen global governance on biological diversity, protect our future generations, protect green mountains and lucid waters, and jointly build a community with a shared future between man and Nature and a clean and beautiful world.

We are ready to work with all countries to defend the common values of humanity, namely peace, development, fairness, justice, democracy and freedom, continue to advance the building of a new type of international relations featuring mutual respect, fairness and justice and win-win cooperation, and jointly build a community with a shared future for mankind.

Colleagues,

Friends,

In just a few days, China will celebrate the centenary of the Communist Party of China (CPC). In the past century, the CPC has made outstanding accomplishments in fighting for national independence and liberation, prosperity of the country and well-being of the people. It is committed to the eternal great cause of the Chinese nation and is right in its prime at its centenary. We will continue to remain true to the CPC's original aspiration, keep in mind its founding mission, and work for happiness of the people, rejuvenation of the nation and harmony of the world!

At this new historical starting point, China will continue to make all-out efforts in participating in UN affairs, safeguard the status of the UN, and promote the purposes and principles of the UN Charter. We will uphold the spirit of extensive consultation, joint contribution and shared benefits and the banner of true multilateralism, and, together with the rest of the world, forge ahead for greater peace and development of mankind!

Thank you. ",State Councilor and Foreign Minister of the People's Republic of China,Xi Jinping,https://www.fmprc.gov.cn/mfa_eng/wjdt_665385/zyjh_665391/t1886891.shtml,,INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS
Russia,14-09-2011,Dmitry Medvedev,United Russia party congress,"Good afternoon, dear friends.

Naturally, it's a pleasure to speak here: there is a special energy in this room, it's simply charged with emotions. And of course, we are meeting on a special day: there are ten weeks until election day, and today you will approve the lists of candidates for State Duma deputies and the party's campaign programme.

A few words about how the elections will take place (I am obliged to say that as head of state, President and guarantor of the Constitution): they will be held under new rules. Thanks to a number of decisions in which you were directly involved, we have significantly revamped our electoral legislation. Together we have enacted a number of initiatives aimed at increasing the role of citizens in the work of governing institutions, in order to improve the quality of popular representation. And during this work United Russia has shown itself to be a strong and, I would even say, generous party, consistently improving the conditions for political competition.

For many years now United Russia has acted as a national political leader able to lead not only in its own interests, but also to rise above narrow group interests, to listen not only to its own supporters but – and this is particularly difficult – to its opponents as well, to pursue strategic goals rather than short-term benefits, and to work in the realm of the possible in the interests of all regions, social groups and citizens of our country. To be a nationwide and all-Russian party in the fullest sense is especially important.

But I would like to praise other processes as well. In line with policies described above, measures have been taken to strengthen democratic processes within the party itself. A new level of political culture has taken hold not only with regard to external matters, but also in relationships between colleagues. Of course, the party retains a strong discipline, just like any other. This is by no means invalid, and helps prevent confusion and hesitation, but excessive formalism and bureaucracy are also very dangerous. They lead to the stagnation and degradation of the political system. And unfortunately, we have already witnessed this in our country's history. I am glad that the party understands this.

I remember well speaking to a similar congress in 2009, when I supported the idea of compulsory primaries and the party's obligatory participation in the debates on elections for all levels of government. Relevant amendments were made to the party's charter, and the positive effects of this are visible today, right in this room. Congress delegates include many new, and simply very nice people. This is very good to see.

And in large part this is thanks to primary elections, primaries in which candidates are nominated for the next election. This is a unique case in Russian politics, and not all parties are ready for this. I have talked about it with the leaders of other parties – some are skeptical about primaries, and I think they fear them. And therefore I believe that this system of primary voting is an important sign of United Russia's maturity and openness.

Of course, it did not all go perfectly smoothly, and perhaps not all losers were able to accept their defeat. In human terms we understand that this is difficult, but as a whole primary voting has proved effective. The party itself passed a very serious test. I congratulate all of you on this.

Our voters are aware of United Russia's work on numerous party projects designed to help resolve the most important and pressing social problems. The party actively helps those who have been made redundant (and unfortunately this problem remains very acute), assists investors who have been deceived, and supports joint equity home ownership. You have organised social control to prevent the rise of housing and utilities prices, and to reign in irresponsible operators who unjustifiably raise service fees.

You pay a great deal of attention to the development of children's sports, you are tackling the problem of the shortage of day care facilities, working on improving the health of our citizens and repairing our roads, as well as supporting talented young people. All of these represent extremely pressing problems, most urgent tasks. Their solution requires daily, time consuming and obscure work – it is much easier to simply talk about something on television – and this is difficult field work. It is this work that our citizens see and appreciate.

I would like to thank you sincerely for your continued and active support for my political strategy. The party proposed my candidacy for the post of president, it has supported me in the past and continues to do so today. This strategy will define the contours of our development in the coming years. I would like to list just a few elements of it, in order to emphasize the unity of our goals.

First. This consists in the modernisation of our economy, education systems, improving industry using technology, improving the investment climate, creating infrastructure for innovations, as well as improving productivity and safety in order to ensure high incomes for citizens, large profits for companies, and revenues for budgets of all levels.

Second is the fulfillment of social obligations, increasing, in the realm of the possible, of course, salaries, pensions, and welfare payments, fighting against poverty, and modernising healthcare.

Third is the eradication of corruption, ensuring the transparency of information about officials' incomes, public purchases made by ministries and agencies, and the transparency of the decisions they take, as well as the appraisal by civic experts of all government initiatives that directly affect citizens' property rights and the scope of their civil liberties.

Fourth involves strengthening the judicial system in light of the principles of independence, transparency and justice, making the criminal legislation governing so-called economic violations or crimes more humane, and increasing the penalties for violent crimes, especially those committed against children, as well as for terrorist acts.

Fifth is facilitating interethnic and interreligious peace, the fight against illegal immigration, ethnically motivated crimes, manifestations of xenophobia and separatism, and supporting the free development of all cultures of the peoples of Russia, as well as all traditional religions.

The sixth has already been mentioned: it is the establishment of a modern political system. We need a responsive, modern political system which provides everyone, including the smallest social groups, with the opportunity to be heard and included in the processes of governance and public administration. This will allow us to make sure that our country does not contain powerless and helpless people; it is very important that freedom and justice remain realities for everyone.

Seventh is maintaining internal and external security, an effective police force, powerful Armed Forces, and increasing the prestige of service in the army, navy and law enforcement agencies.

And of course the eighth element is an independent, sensible foreign policy, ultimately motivated by only one goal, namely increasing the well-being of our people and guaranteeing their security. I can tell you, and I have witnessed this more than once, that you have supported me in all these fields. I sincerely appreciate this support: thank you for it. And I think that United Russia really is a pro-presidential party.

Just before, as party head Vladimir Putin officially addressed me and the congress with the proposal that I head United Russia's party list. Of course this is a responsible position and a very serious proposal. I accept.

I accept and would like to explain my reasons for doing so, in addition to emotional ones. First of all, as I just said, everything the party has worked for and continues to work for is in line with my priorities for our country's development, and the party actively helped my work as president. For that reason ensuring the modernisation of our economic and social life and political system is our shared burden. We therefore have common ideas about the future of our country, common plans for its future, and common answers to the most significant challenges facing our nation, and this is the most important thing.

Secondly, we are similarly aware of what our country should not be.

It must not be weak, poor, ineffective, or break up into parts. It should not suffer from technological backwardness, the arbitrariness of officials, corruption, terrorism, and it must not be isolated. These are positions that we share.

Third, all of us in this room believe that the party itself needs a major overhaul. It must become more open, efficient and, if you want, more rigorous in advancing its priorities.

It must get rid of those random people who attached themselves to it in order to achieve their own, selfish ends; it must finally become younger and more creative in order to compete with the other political forces in our country. Looking around this room, I'm absolutely sure of this.

So if you are ready to entrust me with this job, I'm ready to do it. And

if the party wins the election, which I'm convinced it will, if we continue to work as well as we have in the past, then I am ready to continue to make a real contribution to modernising our economy, raising the living standards of our people, and creating a modern lawful state. Today I think it is right to pay attention to the practical measures necessary to modernise our lives. A dramatically overhauled Russian Government formed by the winning party, which I am sure will be United Russia, should work at this.

Finally, I propose we decide on another very important issue which naturally concerns the party and all of our people who follow politics, namely the candidate for the role of president. In light of the proposal that I head the party list, do party work and, if we perform well in the elections, my willingness to engage in practical work in the Government, I think it's right that the party congress support the candidacy of the current prime minister, Vladimir Putin, in the role of the country's president.

This applause gives me the right to refrain from further elaborating on Vladimir Putin's experience and authority.

A few more words on this subject. I was always asked when we would decide, when we would tell people, and sometimes Vladimir Putin and I were asked: ”have you two fought?“ I want to fully confirm what I just said. What we are proposing to the congress is a deeply thought-through decision. And even more, we already discussed this scenario back when we first formed a friendly alliance. And I very much hope that the passage of years have shown us, and the majority of our citizens, the correctness of our strategy and the effectiveness of the existing governance model.

But while we waited a long time to reveal publicly our positions and the scenario for the next elections, I hope that you, and our citizens, will understand that this was a matter of political expediency, linked to the specific political practices of our country. But I would like to emphasise one thing: we have always told the truth.

Finally, and most importantly, the choice is yours, and that of all the people of Russia.

Dear friends, we know why we are going to the polls: in order to

Win. Today in this room it seems very appropriate to remind our political opponents of the fact that until very recently, only about a decade ago, our country was in the deepest decline, locked in a systemic crisis whose effects were comparable to the damages incurred by civil war. They should remember that. Together we have overcome the most difficult challenges, and raised ourselves up. We are the millions of citizens of our country, the great people of a great state. Through common efforts we preserved and restored our beloved homeland, our Russia. And we will not give her up. We will not give her up to those who want to destroy her, we will not give her away to those who deceive people with empty and unrealistic slogans and promises.

Our beloved country, our Russia, must belong to free, honest and responsible people. I'm sure that it will be that way.

Dmitry Medvedev: Friends,

I am very excited and would like to sincerely thank the conference, the United Russia party and all of you for your trust, everyone who is here today because it shows our common aspiration to achieve the goals that Mr Putin and I talked about.

All of us here in this hall are united in our feeling of excitement but there is still a lot of hard work ahead. We must go through the elections. The election cycle is long and we should all get mobilised to do some serious work. I am talking about the preparations for the elections to the State Duma, then the elections of the President of the Russian Federation, and finally for the formation of the Government of the Russian Federation. I'm confident that we will achieve all of this. Why? Because the goals we have set for ourselves are shared by the overwhelming majority of Russian people. And however much our opponents criticise us – and of course the government and the party are not immune to mistakes – nevertheless, progress has been absolutely steady, and the vast majority of people have been able to feel the benefits of our achievements.

When I speak with ordinary people, my old friends, the people I grew up and studied with, they all note the problems and the mistakes, but they say, “Still, life has changed for the better in our country in recent years.” This comes from the heart and it means that our efforts are not in vain, it means that we have chosen the right path. Our task today is not to abandon this path and to be more efficient, more honest, more open, and sometimes more demanding in order to achieve the results that we are going to achieve.

I am sure we will have many good occasions to discuss our achievements, but now I want to ask you to get ready to do some very serious and very responsible work. And if we succeed, we will have a modern, creative and efficient parliament and we will win the presidential election with a landslide and will elect our candidate, and not some other.

Finally, after that we will put together a government, and if we succeed I am ready to head that government and work for the benefit of our nation.

Once again, I would like to sincerely thank everyone present at the conference today. We are united in the most important aspiration: we want happiness for our nation and we love our country. That is why we will win, and not someone else! Thank you.",President,Dmitry Medvedev,http://en.kremlin.ru/events/president/transcripts/statements/12802,,OTHERS
China,24-10-2014 00:00,H.E. Wang Yi,"Wang Yi: China, a Staunch Defender and Builder of International Rule of Law","

October 24th is the United Nations Day. On this day sixty-nine years ago, the Charter of the United Nations, the instrument of international law with the most far-reaching impact on world peace and security in the modern history of international relations, officially came into effect. On this very day, there is every necessity for us to review the purposes and principles of the UN Charter, reaffirm the commitment to maintaining peace and international rule of law, reject the law of the jungle where the strong do what they want and the weak suffer what they must, and uphold international rule of law, equity and justice.

Chinese President Xi Jinping pointed out in his address delivered in June this year at the meeting commemorating the 60th anniversary of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence that countries should make joint efforts to promote the rule of law in international relations, abide by international law and universally recognized basic principles governing international relations, and apply common rules to tell right from wrong and pursue peace and development. This is an incisive exposition of China's firm commitment to upholding and promoting international rule of law.

Upholding international rule of law is a momentous choice China has made based on its own experience. In the more than 100 years after the Opium War, colonialism and imperialism inflicted untold sufferings on China. For many years, China was unjustly deprived of the right by imperialist powers to equal application of international law. The Chinese people fought indomitably and tenaciously to uphold China's sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity and founded New China. China strove to build a new type of relations with other countries in accordance with the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence on the basis of international law. It broke isolation, blockade and military threat imposed by imperialism and hegemonism, regained its lawful seat in the United Nations, started reform and opening-up program, became fully integrated into the international system, and made remarkable achievements in development. Seeing the contrast between China's past and present, the Chinese people fully recognize how valuable sovereignty, independence and peace are. China ardently hopes for the rule of law in international relations against hegemony and power politics, and rules-based equity and justice, and hopes that the humiliation and sufferings it was subjected to will not happen to others.

China has consistently upheld international rule of law in its diplomatic practice. China has contributed its vision to and set an example for international rule of law. In the past 60 years, China has championed the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence. These principles have been written into China's Constitution and communiqués on the establishment of diplomatic relations and bilateral treaties with over 160 countries, and they have become the cornerstone of China's independent foreign policy of peace. In conducting diplomacy, China has never done anything that violates international law or pursued its own interests at the expense of other countries, irrespective of their size, level of development, strength or values. At the same time, China firmly upholds its sovereignty, security and development interests in accordance with the law. China speaks out to uphold justice on major international and regional issues and firmly defends the basic principles of international law with the UN Charter as the core and basic norms governing international relations. China is committed to peaceful settlement of international disputes and outstanding historical issues. It has completely settled land boundary issues with 12 out of its 14 neighbors through negotiations, and has resolved the issue of boundary delineation of the Beibu Gulf with Vietnam. China has taken a constructive part in the formulation of international rules and contributed its input on major issues concerning the interpretation, application and development of international law. China has concluded more than 23,000 bilateral agreements, acceded to over 400 multilateral treaties and joined almost all the international organizations at the inter-governmental level. China honors its treaty obligations in both letter and spirit in accordance with the principle of ""Pacta Sunt Servanda"", and takes seriously its international responsibilities.

Promoting international rule of law serves China's inevitable needs for peaceful development. China has made the strategic choice to steadfastly follow the path of peaceful development, which features the pursuit of peace, development, cooperation and win-win outcome. The path will be broader and more smooth so long as countries properly handle their respective relations of interests in accordance with international law and rules guiding international relations. Defying rules or following a beggar-thy-neighbor policy will get one nowhere and hence will never become a hallmark of China's peaceful development. The more China develops, the greater its needs to cooperate closely with other countries and the more it desires a peaceful and stable international environment. As China grows stronger, it will make greater contribution to the maintenance and promotion of international rule of law, as it works with other countries to build a fairer and more reasonable international political and economic order.

Since the end of World War II, international rule of law has traversed a zig-zag course, but moved forward in providing an important institutional safeguard for the promotion of world peace and common development. The UN Charter has laid down a solid foundation for building international rule of law through the true and universal application of international law in all countries. With international cooperation in various areas growing robustly, international rules have become improved and assumed greater binding power. From outer space to the bottom of the ocean, from science expedition in the Antarctica to cooperation in Arctic affairs, and from climate change to environmental protection, international rules are everywhere and affect people's lives in a fundamental way. In today's world, acting in accordance with international law is the common sense, whereas breaching international law is unpopular.

Meanwhile, promoting international rule of law is still faced with many difficulties and challenges. Hegemonism, power politics and all forms of ""new interventionism"" pose a direct challenge to basic principles of international law including respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity and non-interference in other countries' internal affairs. Some countries follow a pragmatist or a double-standard approach to international law, using whatever that suits their interests and abandoning whatever that does not. What is more, North-South inequality in the formulation and application of international rules remains salient. Rules dealing with cyber security, terrorism, climate change and other global issues need to be further improved. Promoting international rule of law remains a long and uphill battle.

The just concluded Fourth Plenum of the 18th CPC Central Committee made important arrangements on comprehensively promoting rule of law, sending a clear signal to the world of China's commitment to building a country ruled by law. Diplomacy is an extension of domestic affairs. Therefore, China, which is committed to rule of law at home, will naturally act as a strong defender and active builder of international rule of law. To this end, we suggest that the following principles be observed in earnest.

First, we must uphold international law and the universally recognized norms governing international relations, so as to shore up the foundation of international rule of law. Such principles as respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity, peaceful settlement of international disputes and non-interference in the internal affairs of others, as enshrined in the UN Charter, are the foundation stones upon which modern international law and conduct of international relations are built. They are the core elements that must be adhered to in promoting international rule of law. What has transpired in international relations shows time and again that these principles, if followed in earnest, are the blessings for all mankind, while their breach and betrayal will cause endless harm.

Second, we must commit to the overarching goal of peace, development, cooperation and win-win outcome, so as to strengthen the values underpinning the basis of international rule of law. Making good laws for a country and the country will be well-governed. In promoting international rule of law, the most important thing is to use universally applicable rules in international relations to distinguish right and wrong, end disputes and seek a win-win solution through coordination. This is vital to international rule of law. The formulation, interpretation and application of international law should all be conducive to this goal. Under no circumstances should we inflate the arrogance of hegemonism and power politics, still less use international rule of law to instigate disagreement and friction, for it will only lead us to a wrong direction.

Third, we must ensure an equal and democratic participation in the making of international rules, so as to highlight the nature of international rule of law. Promoting greater democracy in international relations is the aspiration of all countries and represents the historical trend of development. We must work hard to bring all countries, particularly the developing countries, into the rule-making process as equals. In international legislation, it is important to reflect countries' concerns in a balanced manner and to resist the attempt to make the rules of certain countries as ""international rules"", and their standards ""international standards"".

Fourth, we must uphold the authority of international law, so as to maintain the credibility of international rule of law. Laws must be enforced in a just manner. All countries must make international law their common yardstick, exercise their rights in its accordance, fulfill their obligations in good faith and ensure the equal and universal application of international law. National and international judicial institutions should avoid overstepping their authority in interpreting and applying international law. Still less should they encroach on the rights and interests of other countries under the pretext of ""the rule of law"" in total disregard of objectivity and fairness.

Success hinges on persistence rather than speed. As long as the international community work hand in hand with a firm commitment, they will surely overcome all obstacles and challenges, steadily advance the cause of international rule of law, and bathe the development of mankind in the warm sunshine of international equity and justice.
",State Councilor and Foreign Minister of the People's Republic of China,Xi Jinping,https://www.fmprc.gov.cn/mfa_eng/wjdt_665385/zyjh_665391/t1204247.shtml,,INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS
Russia,05-03-2011 00:00,Dmitry Medvedev,Meeting on organisation of children's summer holidays,"Good afternoon, colleagues,

This is a workday for us and I would like to come back to a subject we have been addressing at length last year: school holidays and children’s health resorts.

Summer holidays are just around the corner and this year about 70,000 health camps will open in our country. Last year 8.6 million children received treatment and spent their holidays at such camps. This is a major challenge: we must do everything necessary to ensure that these camps are in good condition, that they have everything they need and provide the best possible conditions for recreation.

Last autumn, we summed up the previous summer season and analysed the main shortcomings and positive experience, which was hopefully also gained. I issued instructions to remedy a number of problems regarding the organisation of children's holidays, and since the deadlines for their execution have passed, I expect the relevant ministers to report on their efforts and the preparations for the upcoming holiday season.

    “Summer holidays are just around the corner so we must do everything necessary to ensure that children’s recreation camps have everything they need.”

Let me remind you also that from January 1, 2010 the responsibility for the organisation of children’s summer holidays and health treatment was transferred to the regional and municipal authorities. The aggregate expenditure on this totalled nearly 50 billion rubles last year, which is quite a lot of money.

Now, a few words about the key issues we must discuss today. First, we agreed to develop consolidated standards for all children's health camps. Of course, these must be the highest standards possible: the health standards and the rules for children’s transportation to the camp and home. In addition to creating a safe and comfortable environment for the children these standards must also be enforceable. Naturally, compliance must be monitored on a regular basis and violations of rules and procedures should entail liability. In this context, let me remind you of some sad statistics. The number of outbreaks of epidemic diseases increased in 2010 compared with 2009, and 186 children fell ill, while 16 children died in accidents.

I know that several regions of those represented here at this meeting have children's insurance. I believe that this positive experience should be extended to the rest of our country. In 2010, children’s insurance existed in only three Russian regions, but this year we intend to introduce it in 61 regions, or nearly two-thirds of our country. I think it is necessary to introduce it everywhere because it is a civilised system that can help us address many problems.

Another issue is the depreciation of the infrastructure at summer camps. All of us are familiar with this subject. Most camps were built in the period from the 1960s to the 1980s, during the Soviet era. Almost 25% of them need repairs, and I believe this figure is overoptimistic because we have a tendency to patch up problems and say, ‘Here, we have fixed it and everything is fine now.’ But in reality the figure is much higher. I want to understand how the work is proceeding and would like to hear from government members and the regional governors.

    “A great deal depends on the teachers, their professional qualifications and their personal qualities. I instructed the Government to draft by the end of April a programme for the training of counsellors and other professionals employed at children's camps.”

Targeted programmes on children's holidays have been adopted and are being implemented in 38 regions. Ideally, each region should have a programme of its own because there are children everywhere. I believe that the regional governments, governors and other local authorities should be in charge of this effort. Moreover, these programmes should not be aimed at just patching up holes; they must create new recreation areas and ensure a full-fledged infrastructure upgrade and increase children’s safety. If such programmes are adopted but do not incorporate these tasks, they must be revised.

Last year, we repeatedly stated that it would be unacceptable to convert children’s holiday facilities. I issued instructions to take all necessary steps, within the bounds of the law of course, to prevent such actions. I also want to hear what has been done in this area.

Third. Summer holidays are an excellent opportunity for many people, and for some it may be the only opportunity, to recharge their batteries, while for children it is a chance to make friends and to learn something new. This is especially true of situations where children are caught in difficult circumstances, be it major perturbations our country has seen or personal health problems. A great deal depends on teachers, their professional qualifications and their personal qualities.

I instructed the Government to draft by the end of April a programme for the training of counsellors and other professionals employed at children's camps. We talked about this last year as well because, unfortunately, there are all kinds of teachers and counsellors, and some of them need additional training. It is also necessary to draft recommendations for recreation activities and for the improvement of educational work. I would like to hear a report on this topic.

Let's start the discussion.

China,09-10-2013 00:00,Xi Jinping,Deepen Reform and Opening up and Work Together for a Better Asia Pacific,"Chairman Wishnu Wardhana,
Ladies and Gentlemen,
Dear Friends,

It is a great pleasure for me to have the opportunity to join you, distinguished representatives of the Asia-Pacific business community, in this island paradise.

Bali is not only a world-renowned tourist attraction, but also the birthplace of Bali Process and Bali Roadmap. And now, hosting the APEC Economic Leaders' Meeting, Bali carries the expectations of the Asia Pacific and the rest of the world.

The world economy is still struggling for recovery, and the Asia-Pacific economy, while enjoying a good momentum of growth, is confronted with new challenges. People around the world are looking to this year's APEC meeting to give new impetus to regional and global economic growth.

Ladies and Gentlemen,

Dear Friends,

The world economy is still in the middle of profound readjustment. While there are signs of recovery, there are also problems of fragile foundation, inadequate momentum and uneven speed of growth. Major developed economies are far from resolving their structural problems, making it all the more necessary to strengthen macro-economic policy coordination. Emerging market economies have slowed down and now face more external risks and challenges. The Doha Round negotiations are fraught with difficulties, and trade and investment protectionism is resurfacing in new forms. To achieve a full recovery and healthy growth of the world economy will be a long and tortuous process.

Confronted with the new challenges in the world economy, both developed and developing economies are looking for new drivers of growth.

Where can we find the new drivers? In my opinion, they can only be found through reform, readjustment and innovation. The Asia Pacific has long been an important engine of world economic growth. To push for a recovery of the sluggish world economy, economies in the Asia Pacific should have the courage to do what has never been done before and build an open growth model featuring innovative development, interconnected growth and converging interests. Only by so doing can the Asia-Pacific economies, as one Chinese poem describes, ""find the way to the next village shaded in soft willows and bright flowers despite the difficulties posed by mountains and rivers"" and play a leading role in the recovery of the world economy.

This is exactly what China is doing. China's economy grew at a speed of 7.6% in the first half of this year. This is, indeed, somewhat lower than the previous growth rate of over 8%, which has caused some friends to worry about the prospects of the Chinese economy. Some wondered whether there would be a hard landing, whether sustained, healthy growth was still possible, how China would deal with this situation, and what impact this would have on the Asia Pacific. Here I wish to share with you some of my observations.

To begin with, I want to emphasize that based on a comprehensive analysis of all factors, I am fully confident about the future of China's economy.

I am confident because first of all China's growth rate is within the reasonable and expected range. From the previous double-digit growth rate to 9.3% in 2011, 7.8% last year and 7.6% in the first half of this year, the change in speed of growth has on the whole been smooth. In fact, the growth rate of 7.6% makes the Chinese economy the fastest growing among major economies. The fundamentals of the Chinese economy are good; GDP growth and other major economic indicators are within the expected range. So everything has been going as expected and nothing has come as a surprise.

The slowdown of the Chinese economy is an intended result of our own regulatory initiatives. This is because to achieve the goal of doubling the 2010 GDP and per capita income by 2020, a 7% annual growth rate will suffice according to a thorough calculation done at the time we set our mid and long-term development goals. Moreover, we have recognized that to fundamentally ensure long-term economic development, China has to press ahead with structural reform, even if this requires some sacrifice of speed. In whatever undertaking, one has to look far and plan wisely to take care of both the short and long term needs. Killing the hen to get eggs or draining the pond to catch fish is no formula for sustainable development.

Second, I am confident because the quality and efficiency of China's economic development are improving steadily. China's economic performance in the first half of this year has been generally smooth and made progress. By ""smooth"", I mean our economic growth has been within a reasonable range, and by ""progress"" I mean the shift of our growth model has picked up pace. China is moving from over-reliance on investment and export in the past to increased dependence on domestic demand, especially on consumption. The economic figures for the first half of this year show an increasingly visible role of structural adjustment in boosting growth. Domestic demand has contributed 7.5 percentage points to the GDP growth, with 3.4 percentage points coming from consumption. We no longer take GDP growth rate as the sole criterion for success. Instead, we are focusing more on improving the quality and efficiency of growth. This has been proven a responsible approach for both China and the world.

Third, I am confident because China has a strong home-grown driving force for growth. This force is growing and will continue to get stronger. The ongoing process of a new type of urbanization will create space for hundreds of millions of Chinese to move from villages to cities in pursuit of a better life. The improvement of education in China will bring about a new generation of modern, professional workforce of higher caliber, broader vision and better skills. China's vigorous implementation of the innovation-driven development strategy will more closely link science and technology with economic growth, and foster innovation and emerging industries. The continued expansion of domestic demand and consumer market in China will unlock considerable potential for growth. And above all, China is committed to putting people first and making development benefits accessible to more people across the country. All these will translate into a strong home-grown force for the growth of the Chinese economy.

Fourth, I am confident because the Asia Pacific enjoys sound development prospects. Thanks to the concerted efforts of all economies, the Asia Pacific boasts a high level of free movement of capital, information and people, an increasingly clear division of labor, and an emerging shape of a big Asia-Pacific market. The new scientific and industrial revolutions that are in the making will add to the existing strengths of this region. The Asia-Pacific economies are also in a much better position to fend off risks, with more flexible exchange rate regimes, notably larger foreign exchange reserves and various multilateral and bilateral financial arrangements providing institutional protection in the face of complicated situations. China has faith in the development prospects of the Asia Pacific. Benefiting from the overall economic growth in the region, China has achieved its own development. At the same time, China's development has also contributed to regional economic growth. I believe that such interaction will gain even stronger momentum, thus creating more opportunities for the development of the whole region.

I am deeply convinced that the Chinese economy will sustain its sound growth. At the same time, we are soberly aware of potential problems and challenges from falling demand, overcapacity, local debts and shadow banking, and we are paying close attention to possible impacts coming from the outside. In this connection, we are taking prudent and proper measures to forestall any potential problems.

Ladies and Gentlemen,

Dear Friends,

The Chinese economy has entered a new development stage. It is undergoing profound transformation of growth model and structural readjustment. In this process, there will inevitably come one challenge after another. Efforts to meet the challenges will be accompanied by throes of readjustment and growing pains, which will prove to be worthwhile.

Rainbow often appears after wind and rain. As someone aptly puts it, ""No mountain is too high for a man to scale and no road too long for a man to walk."" However high the mountain may be or daunting the obstacles may seem, we will be able to reach our goal as long as we stay the course and keep moving forward.

If China is to make progress, it must deepen reform and opening-up in all respects. To live up to the new expectations of our people, we must, with firm confidence in reform and opening-up, greater political courage and wisdom, and stronger measures, advance reform and opening-up, further open our mind, unleash and develop social productivity, and unlock and enhance the creative forces of the society.

China is drawing up a master plan for the deepening of reform in all respects. Our general approach is to press ahead with reforms in economic, political, cultural, social and ecological fields in a balanced manner, address the challenges cropping up in the course of development, remove institutional obstacles to sustained and healthy economic growth, and create new impetus to economic development through reform.

We will improve our basic economic system, strengthen the building of market system, advance institutional reform in macro regulation, fiscal and tax systems, financial sectors and investment, deepen the market-oriented reform of interest rates and exchange rate, make the RMB exchange rate more flexible, and achieve, over time, the convertibility of the RMB under capital account. We will continue to reform the administration system, transform the functions of the government, streamline government and delegate powers in order to have a clearly-defined relationship between the government and the market and let the market play its basic role in allocating resources to a greater degree and in a wider scope. We will improve the management system of science and technology, enhance innovation capability, and build a system for technological innovation which is led by enterprises and guided by the market and which integrates the efforts of enterprises, universities and research institutes. We will ensure and improve people's well-being on a priority basis, promote social equity and justice, achieve higher quality employment, deepen the reform of income distribution system and improve social security and basic public services. We will step up environmental protection and resources conservation to create a good working and living environment for our people and make new contribution to the global response to climate change.

We will follow a more proactive opening-up strategy, improve the open economy which is mutually beneficial, diversified, balanced, secure and efficient, encourage coastal, inland and border areas to draw on each other's strengths in opening-up, develop open areas that take the lead in global economic cooperation and competition, and form leading areas of opening-up that drive regional development. We will continue to attach equal importance to export and import, and promote balance in foreign trade. We will ""bring in"" foreign investment and encourage companies to ""go global"" at the same time, and enhance international investment cooperation. We will deepen investment- and trade-related institutional reforms, and improve relevant legislation to create a legal environment in which foreign companies in China can operate in a level playing field. We will make overall planning for bilateral, multilateral, regional and sub-regional opening-up and cooperation, accelerate the implementation of the FTA strategy, and promote connectivity with our neighboring countries.

We are aware that the reform is a profound revolution that involves adjustment of major interests and improvement of systems and institutions in various fields. China's reform has entered the deep water zone where tough challenges must be met. The problems we face in the current phase of reform are especially difficult. They are hard nuts to crack, so to speak. It is extremely important that we press ahead without ever letting up. If we hesitate and become indecisive, we will not be able to make breakthroughs and all our previous gains may be lost.

China is a big country. We can not afford any drastic mistake on issues of fundamental importance, as damage from such mistakes will be beyond remedy. Our position is that we must be both bold enough to explore and make advances, and sufficiently prudent in carefully planning our action. We will stick to the right direction and press ahead with reform and opening-up. We will have the courage to crack the ""hard nuts"", navigate the uncharted waters and take on deep-seated problems that have built up over the years. We must not stop, even for a while, in our pursuit of reform and opening-up.

Ladies and Gentlemen,

Dear Friends,

The Asia Pacific is a big family and China is a member of this family. China cannot develop in isolation from the Asia Pacific while the Asia Pacific cannot prosper without China. Sustained and healthy development of the Chinese economy will bring greater opportunities to the development of the region.

China will firmly uphold regional peace and stability, and help cement the foundation for a win-win situation in the Asia Pacific. I want to repeat what I have said at the Boao Forum for Asia and other events this year, ""Peace, like air and sunshine, is hardly noticed when people are benefiting from it. But none of us can live without it."" Without peace, development is out of the question, like water without source and a tree without roots. We the Chinese often say, ""A family of harmony prospers."" As a member of the Asia-Pacific family, China is ready to live in amity with other family members and help each other. We hope that all members of the Asia-Pacific family will cherish the peace and stability we enjoy, which has not come easily, and work together for a harmonious Asia Pacific of enduring peace and common prosperity.

China will work energetically to boost regional development and prosperity, and broaden opportunities for mutual benefit in the Asia Pacific. China is the biggest trading partner, largest export market and a major source of investment for many Asia-Pacific economies. In 2012, China accounted for more than 50% of Asia's economic growth. By the end of the same year, China had approved more than 760,000 foreign invested businesses, and attracted around US$ 1.3 trillion of foreign direct investment. China has signed with 20 countries and regions 12 free trade agreements, with six more under negotiations. Most of China's free trade partners are APEC members. In the coming five years, China will import over US$10 trillion of goods, invest over US$500 billion overseas, and send over 400 million tourists abroad. China's growing domestic demand, particularly consumption and investment demand, will offer foreign investors more opportunities of cooperation.

China will commit itself to building a cross-Pacific regional cooperation framework that benefits all parties. The vast Pacific is free of natural barriers, and we should not erect any man-made ones. We should let APEC lead and coordinate our actions, and uphold the approach of openness, inclusiveness and mutual benefit. We should enhance coordination on macro-economic policies and among regional free trade arrangements, deepen regional integration, and avoid the Spaghetti Bowl effect, so as to build closer partnership across the Pacific and jointly pursue long-term development of the Asia Pacific.

Ladies and Gentlemen,

Dear Friends,

""Boundless is the ocean where we sail with the wind."" Like a vast ocean, the Asia Pacific offers enough sailing space for us to make progress together. Each and every APEC member has a stake in the future development of the Asia Pacific.

China has high hopes for this year's APEC Economic Leaders' Meeting. We stand ready to work with our partners in this region to build a beautiful Asia Pacific that leads the world, benefits all sides, and ensures the well-being of future generations. With this in mind, I would like to share with you my vision about the Asia-Pacific region in four aspects.

First, an Asia-Pacific region that seeks common development. The Asia-Pacific economies have close ties and shared interests. We should draw upon our respective strengths, optimize the allocation of economic resources, improve industrial layout, and build an Asia-Pacific value chain and a big Asia-Pacific market where benefits are shared by all. The developed economies should provide stronger support and assistance to the developing ones, while the latter should for their part work hard to catch up. Only by narrowing the development gap can we all rise with the tide of development in the Asia Pacific.

Second, an Asia-Pacific region that stays committed to open development. The end of World War II was followed by an economic boom of more than 25 years in 13 economies in the world. One common feature of the economies was their policy of opening-up. We should follow the trend of the times, uphold a multilateral trading system that is free, open and non-discriminatory, and oppose all forms of protectionism. We should work together in building open economy and a framework for regional cooperation, and, in an open and inclusive spirit, advance the building of a free trade area of the Asia Pacific.

Third, an Asia-Pacific region that promotes innovation-driven development. Growth will be unsustainable if it is solely driven by fiscal stimulus measures and unconventional monetary policies, and will be too costly if it is based on excessive consumption of resources and achieved at the expense of the environment. We need innovation in both the thinking and approaches of development. We should abandon outdated mindsets, break away from old confines, and pursue green, circular and low-carbon development. We should continue to improve our capability in innovation so as to foster emerging industries, explore new driving force for growth and enhance core competitiveness.

Fourth, an Asia-Pacific region that pursues interconnected growth. The Asia-Pacific economies are interdependent on each other, with shared interests and common destiny. The success or failure of one may ultimately lead to success or failure of all. In this chain of dynamic interactions, one economy's development will have a knock-on effect on other economies. We should strengthen the sense of community of common destiny, contribute to other's development with that of one's own, tap fully into our respective strengths through coordination and interconnection, pass on positive energy and achieve sound interactions and coordinated development among all economies.

At present, Asian countries, especially emerging markets and developing countries, are in great financial needs to develop infrastructure. Particularly in the face of such severe challenges as mounting downward pressure and financial volatility, it is necessary for us to mobilize more funds for infrastructural development to maintain sustained and steady economic growth and promote connectivity and economic integration in the region. To this end, we propose to establish an Asian infrastructure investment bank to help fund the infrastructural development of ASEAN countries and other developing countries in the region. This proposed bank will work together with the existing multilateral development banks in and outside the region and complement one another to fuel the sustained and steady growth of the Asian economy.

Ladies and Gentlemen,

Dear Friends,

The business community is a major force for the development of economy and trade as well as an integral part in APEC cooperation. China places great importance on the role of the business community. We are ready to hear your views and suggestions and facilitate your deeper and easier engagement, especially that of SMEs and micro businesses, in economic development and regional cooperation.

Last August, China's business community established an APEC China Business Council. This provides institutional guarantee for the business sector's deeper involvement in the making of economic and trade rules in the Asia Pacific, and demonstrates the readiness of China's business community to undertake international responsibilities.

More friends, more opportunities. Many of you present here are old friends of the Chinese people who have participated in China's reform and opening-up endeavor. We will never forget old friends, and we will be most happy to make new ones. China welcomes and encourages businesses from all economies, APEC members in particular, to invest and do business in China and take an active part in China's reform and opening-up endeavor. The more friends we have, the more China's reform and opening-up endeavor will thrive and prosper.

I hope friends from the business community will make full use of APEC as a platform to get your voices heard on how to improve trade and investment environment in the Asia Pacific, and, with your strength in market information, technology incubation, and innovative capability, put forward strategic and forward-looking suggestions so as to contribute your ideas to promoting trade and investment liberalization and facilitation, deepening regional economic integration and the future development of APEC.

Ladies and Gentlemen,

Dear Friends,

China will host the 2014 APEC Economic Leaders' Meeting and the related events. We will, taking this opportunity and focusing on the future of APEC, seek to build closer partnerships, deepen pragmatic cooperation, and enhance the leading role of APEC in shaping the long-term development vision of the Asia-Pacific region.

I hope that all of you, friends from the Asia-Pacific business community, will meet in Beijing then for discussions and witness another important moment in the development of the Asia Pacific.

Thank you.",President,Xi Jinping,https://www.fmprc.gov.cn/mfa_eng/wjdt_665385/zyjh_665391/t1088517.shtml,,INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS
USA,29-06-2015,Barack Obama,"
Remarks by the President at Signing of the Defending Public Safety Employees' Retirement Act and the Trade Preferences Extension Act of 2015"," Thank you.  Well, welcome to the White House.  I thought we’d start off the week with something we should do more often -- a truly bipartisan bill signing.  (Applause.) 

For six and a half years, we’ve worked to rescue the economy from the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression, to get it growing again and to rebuild it on a new foundation for prosperity.  Today, our businesses have created more than 12 million new jobs in the past five years -- that's the longest streak of job growth on record; 401(k)s have been replenished; the housing market is stronger; and more than 16 million Americans have gained the financial security of health insurance. (Applause.)   

But a constantly changing economy demands our constant effort to protect hardworking Americans and protect their success.  And one of the things we ought to be doing is rewriting the rules of global trade to make sure that they benefit American workers and American businesses, and that they reflect American values -- especially now, while our economy is in a position of global strength.  The two bills that I’ll sign today will help America do just that.  

The first will help us pass new, 21st century trade agreements with higher standards and tougher protections than those that we’ve signed before.  The Trans-Pacific Partnership, for example, includes strong protections for workers and the environment.  Unlike previous agreements, those provisions will actually be enforceable.  And that’s good for American businesses and America workers because we already meet high standards than -- higher standards than most of the rest of the world.  So we want to make sure that everybody else catches up. This agreement will help us level the playing field.

The second bill offers even more support for American workers.  It renews and expands the trade adjustment assistance program, which provides job training and other assistance to tens of thousands of American workers every year.  It gives us new tools to help American steelworkers and folks in other critical industries fight against unfair practices by other countries.  It also reauthorizes AGOA, the African Growth and Opportunity Act, which has had strong bipartisan support for many years now, and which helps open up markets in Africa to American businesses while making it easier for African businesses to sell their products in America.  And we’re extending a similar program to Haiti, and renewing support for other development -- developing economies through what’s known as the Generalized System of Preferences.

Now, I think it’s fair to say that getting these bills through Congress has not been easy.  (Laughter.)  They’ve been declared dead more than once.  They have inspired long and passionate debates -- and that’s entirely appropriate for our democracy.  That’s how this country is supposed to work.  We're supposed to make sure that we air our differences and then, ultimately, Congress works its will -- especially on issues that inspire strongly held feelings on all sides.  

But I would not be doing this, I would not be signing these bills if I was not absolutely convinced that these pieces of legislation are ultimately good for American workers.  I would not be signing them if I wasn’t convinced they’d be good for American businesses.  I would not be signing them if I did not know that they will give us a competitive edge in this new economy, and that that new economy cannot be reversed.  We have to embrace it.

This legislation will help turn global trade -- which can often be a race to the bottom -- into a race to the top.  It will reinforce America’s leadership role in the world -– in Asia, and in Europe, and beyond.  If I didn’t believe it, I wouldn’t have fought so hard to get these things done.

So this is a good day.  And I want to thank everybody who has helped us get it -- get to this day.  We’ve got small business owners, environmental and global development groups, other advocates who were a big part of this campaign.  We’ve got some outstanding members of Congress, both Republican and Democrat, who came together to make this happen.  I want to name just a few.  Although Congress is on recess, I think it’s important to acknowledge Speaker John Boehner and Leader Mitch McConnell; Senators Orrin Hatch, Ron Wyden and Patty Murray; Congressmen Paul Ryan, Ron Kind and Pat Tiberi.  And thanks to all the senators and representatives who took tough votes and encouraged their colleagues to do the same.

This was a true bipartisan effort.  And it’s a reminder of what we can get done –- even on the toughest issues -- when we work together in a spirit of compromise.  I hope we’re going to be able to summon that same spirit on future challenges, like starting to rebuild some of our roads and bridges and infrastructure around the country -- (applause) -- because the American people deserve nothing less from us.  

Let me just make one more comment.  The trade authorization that’s provided here is not the actual trade agreements.  So we still have some tough negotiations that are going to be taking place.  There has always been concern that people want transparency in those agreements -- under this authorization, these agreements will be posted on a website for a long period of time for people to scrutinize, and take a look at, and pick apart.  

And so the debate on the particular provisions of trade will not end with this bill signing.  But I’m very confident that we’re going to be able to say at the end of the day that the trade agreements that come under this authorization are going to improve the system of trade that we have right now.  And that’s a good thing.

I think it’s also important to note that trade is just one part of a broader agenda of middle-class economics.  And so we’ve still got more work to do on infrastructure.  We’ve still got more work to do on job training.  We’ve still got more work to do on research and development.  We’ve still got more work to do to make sure that folks are getting good wages for hard work.  We’ve still got too many communities that are left behind around the country.  We’ve still got more work to do to help support our small businesses, who are extraordinary job creators.

So this is not the end of the road; this is just one step in a long path to making sure that the next generation enjoys the extraordinary prosperity that our parents and grandparents passed down to us.  And although there are going to be disagreements between the parties on particular elements, I think what we can agree on is that in this country, if you work hard, you should be able to get ahead no matter where you come from, what you look like, or who you love.  (Applause.) 

With that, let me sign this piece of legislation.  (Applause.) 

(The bill is signed.)

All right.  For those of you who work for me, get back to work.  (Laughter.)  

Thank you very much, everybody.  (Applause.) ",President,Barack Obama,https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/the-press-office/2015/06/29/remarks-president-signing-defending-public-safety-employees-retirement,,DEVELOPMENT

Weekly Address: Giving Thanks to our Fallen Heroes this Memorial Day"," Hi, everybody.   This week, I’ve been speaking about America’s national security – our past, our present, and our future. 

On Thursday, I outlined the future of our fight against terrorism – the threats we face, and the way in which we will meet them.

On Friday, I went to Annapolis to celebrate the extraordinary young men and women of the United States Naval Academy’s Class of 2013 – the sailors and Marines who will not only lead that fight, but who will lead our country for decades to come.

And on Monday, we celebrate Memorial Day.  Unofficially, it’s the start of summer – a chance for us to spend some time with family and friends, at barbecues or the beach, getting a little fun and relaxation in before heading back to work. 

It’s also a day on which we set aside some time, on our own or with our families, to honor and remember all the men and women who have given their lives in service to this country we love.

They are heroes, each and every one.  They gave America the most precious thing they had – “the last full measure of devotion.”  And because they did, we are who we are today – a free and prosperous nation, the greatest in the world. 

At a time when only about one percent of the American people bear the burden of our defense, the service and sacrifice of our men and women in uniform isn’t always readily apparent.  That’s partly because our soldiers, sailors, airmen, Marines and coast guardsmen are so skilled at what they do.  It’s also because those who serve tend to do so quietly.  They don’t seek the limelight.  They don’t serve for our admiration, or even our gratitude.  They risk their lives, and many give their lives, for something larger than themselves or any of us:  the ideals of liberty and justice that make America a beacon of hope for the world. 

That’s been true throughout our history – from our earliest days, when a tiny band of revolutionaries stood up to an Empire, to our 9/11 Generation, which continues to serve and sacrifice today. 

Every time a threat has risen, Americans have risen to meet it.  And because of that courage – that willingness to fight, and even die – America endures.

That is the purpose of Memorial Day.  To remember with gratitude the countless men and women who gave their lives so we could know peace and live in freedom. 

And we must do more than remember. 

We must care for the loved ones that our fallen service members have left behind.

We must make sure all our veterans have the care and benefits they’ve earned, and the jobs and opportunity they deserve. 

We must be there for the military families whose loved ones are in harm’s way – for they serve as well.

And above all, we must make sure that the men and women of our armed forces have the support they need to achieve their missions safely at home and abroad. 

The young men and women I met at the Naval Academy this week know the meaning of service.  They’ve studied the heroes of our history.  They’ve chosen to follow in their footsteps – to stand their watch, man a ship, lead a platoon.  They are doing their part.  And each of us must do ours. 

So this weekend, as we commemorate Memorial Day, I ask you to hold all our fallen heroes in your hearts. 

And every day, let us work together to preserve what their sacrifices achieved – to make our country even stronger, even more fair, even more free.  That is our mission.  It is our obligation.  And it is our privilege, as the heirs of those who came before us, and as citizens of the United States of America.

Remarks by President Obama at Memorial Service for Former South African President Nelson Mandela","Thank you.  (Applause.)  Thank you so much.  Thank you.  To Graça Machel and the Mandela family; to President Zuma and members of the government; to heads of states and government, past and present; distinguished guests -- it is a singular honor to be with you today, to celebrate a life like no other.  To the people of South Africa -- (applause) -- people of every race and walk of life -- the world thanks you for sharing Nelson Mandela with us.  His struggle was your struggle.  His triumph was your triumph.  Your dignity and your hope found expression in his life.  And your freedom, your democracy is his cherished legacy.

It is hard to eulogize any man -- to capture in words not just the facts and the dates that make a life, but the essential truth of a person -- their private joys and sorrows; the quiet moments and unique qualities that illuminate someone’s soul.  How much harder to do so for a giant of history, who moved a nation toward justice, and in the process moved billions around the world.

Born during World War I, far from the corridors of power, a boy raised herding cattle and tutored by the elders of his Thembu tribe, Madiba would emerge as the last great liberator of the 20th century.  Like Gandhi, he would lead a resistance movement -- a movement that at its start had little prospect for success.  Like Dr. King, he would give potent voice to the claims of the oppressed and the moral necessity of racial justice.  He would endure a brutal imprisonment that began in the time of Kennedy and Khrushchev, and reached the final days of the Cold War.  Emerging from prison, without the force of arms, he would -- like Abraham Lincoln -- hold his country together when it threatened to break apart.  And like America’s Founding Fathers, he would erect a constitutional order to preserve freedom for future generations -- a commitment to democracy and rule of law ratified not only by his election, but by his willingness to step down from power after only one term.

Given the sweep of his life, the scope of his accomplishments, the adoration that he so rightly earned, it’s tempting I think to remember Nelson Mandela as an icon, smiling and serene, detached from the tawdry affairs of lesser men.  But Madiba himself strongly resisted such a lifeless portrait.  (Applause.)  Instead, Madiba insisted on sharing with us his doubts and his fears; his miscalculations along with his victories.  “I am not a saint,” he said, “unless you think of a saint as a sinner who keeps on trying.”

It was precisely because he could admit to imperfection -- because he could be so full of good humor, even mischief, despite the heavy burdens he carried -- that we loved him so.  He was not a bust made of marble; he was a man of flesh and blood -- a son and a husband, a father and a friend.  And that’s why we learned so much from him, and that’s why we can learn from him still.  For nothing he achieved was inevitable.  In the arc of his life, we see a man who earned his place in history through struggle and shrewdness, and persistence and faith.  He tells us what is possible not just in the pages of history books, but in our own lives as well.

Mandela showed us the power of action; of taking risks on behalf of our ideals.  Perhaps Madiba was right that he inherited, “a proud rebelliousness, a stubborn sense of fairness” from his father.  And we know he shared with millions of black and colored South Africans the anger born of, “a thousand slights, a thousand indignities, a thousand unremembered moments…a desire to fight the system that imprisoned my people,” he said.

But like other early giants of the ANC -- the Sisulus and Tambos -- Madiba disciplined his anger and channeled his desire to fight into organization, and platforms, and strategies for action, so men and women could stand up for their God-given dignity.  Moreover, he accepted the consequences of his actions, knowing that standing up to powerful interests and injustice carries a price.  “I have fought against white domination and I have fought against black domination.  I’ve cherished the ideal of a democratic and free society in which all persons live together in harmony and [with] equal opportunities.  It is an ideal which I hope to live for and to achieve.  But if needs be, it is an ideal for which I am prepared to die.”  (Applause.)

Mandela taught us the power of action, but he also taught us the power of ideas; the importance of reason and arguments; the need to study not only those who you agree with, but also those who you don’t agree with.  He understood that ideas cannot be contained by prison walls, or extinguished by a sniper’s bullet.  He turned his trial into an indictment of apartheid because of his eloquence and his passion, but also because of his training as an advocate.  He used decades in prison to sharpen his arguments, but also to spread his thirst for knowledge to others in the movement.  And he learned the language and the customs of his oppressor so that one day he might better convey to them how their own freedom depend upon his.  (Applause.)

Mandela demonstrated that action and ideas are not enough.  No matter how right, they must be chiseled into law and institutions.  He was practical, testing his beliefs against the hard surface of circumstance and history.  On core principles he was unyielding, which is why he could rebuff offers of unconditional release, reminding the Apartheid regime that “prisoners cannot enter into contracts.”

 But as he showed in painstaking negotiations to transfer power and draft new laws, he was not afraid to compromise for the sake of a larger goal.  And because he was not only a leader of a movement but a skillful politician, the Constitution that emerged was worthy of this multiracial democracy, true to his vision of laws that protect minority as well as majority rights, and the precious freedoms of every South African.

And finally, Mandela understood the ties that bind the human spirit.  There is a word in South Africa -- Ubuntu -- (applause) -- a word that captures Mandela’s greatest gift:  his recognition that we are all bound together in ways that are invisible to the eye; that there is a oneness to humanity; that we achieve ourselves by sharing ourselves with others, and caring for those around us.

We can never know how much of this sense was innate in him, or how much was shaped in a dark and solitary cell.  But we remember the gestures, large and small -- introducing his jailers as honored guests at his inauguration; taking a pitch in a Springbok uniform; turning his family’s heartbreak into a call to confront HIV/AIDS -- that revealed the depth of his empathy and his understanding.  He not only embodied Ubuntu, he taught millions to find that truth within themselves. 

It took a man like Madiba to free not just the prisoner, but the jailer as well -- (applause) -- to show that you must trust others so that they may trust you; to teach that reconciliation is not a matter of ignoring a cruel past, but a means of confronting it with inclusion and generosity and truth.  He changed laws, but he also changed hearts.

For the people of South Africa, for those he inspired around the globe, Madiba’s passing is rightly a time of mourning, and a time to celebrate a heroic life.  But I believe it should also prompt in each of us a time for self-reflection.  With honesty, regardless of our station or our circumstance, we must ask:  How well have I applied his lessons in my own life?  It’s a question I ask myself, as a man and as a President. 

We know that, like South Africa, the United States had to overcome centuries of racial subjugation.  As was true here, it took sacrifice -- the sacrifice of countless people, known and unknown, to see the dawn of a new day.  Michelle and I are beneficiaries of that struggle.  (Applause.)  But in America, and in South Africa, and in countries all around the globe, we cannot allow our progress to cloud the fact that our work is not yet done. 

The struggles that follow the victory of formal equality or universal franchise may not be as filled with drama and moral clarity as those that came before, but they are no less important.  For around the world today, we still see children suffering from hunger and disease.  We still see run-down schools.  We still see young people without prospects for the future.  Around the world today, men and women are still imprisoned for their political beliefs, and are still persecuted for what they look like, and how they worship, and who they love.  That is happening today.  (Applause.)

And so we, too, must act on behalf of justice.  We, too, must act on behalf of peace.  There are too many people who happily embrace Madiba’s legacy of racial reconciliation, but passionately resist even modest reforms that would challenge chronic poverty and growing inequality.  There are too many leaders who claim solidarity with Madiba’s struggle for freedom, but do not tolerate dissent from their own people.  (Applause.)  And there are too many of us on the sidelines, comfortable in complacency or cynicism when our voices must be heard.

The questions we face today -- how to promote equality and justice; how to uphold freedom and human rights; how to end conflict and sectarian war -- these things do not have easy answers.  But there were no easy answers in front of that child born in World War I.  Nelson Mandela reminds us that it always seems impossible until it is done.  South Africa shows that is true.  South Africa shows we can change, that we can choose a world defined not by our differences, but by our common hopes.  We can choose a world defined not by conflict, but by peace and justice and opportunity.

We will never see the likes of Nelson Mandela again.  But let me say to the young people of Africa and the young people around the world -- you, too, can make his life’s work your own.  Over 30 years ago, while still a student, I learned of Nelson Mandela and the struggles taking place in this beautiful land, and it stirred something in me.  It woke me up to my responsibilities to others and to myself, and it set me on an improbable journey that finds me here today.  And while I will always fall short of Madiba’s example, he makes me want to be a better man.  (Applause.)  He speaks to what’s best inside us.

After this great liberator is laid to rest, and when we have returned to our cities and villages and rejoined our daily routines, let us search for his strength.  Let us search for his largeness of spirit somewhere inside of ourselves.  And when the night grows dark, when injustice weighs heavy on our hearts, when our best-laid plans seem beyond our reach, let us think of Madiba and the words that brought him comfort within the four walls of his cell:  “It matters not how strait the gate, how charged with punishments the scroll, I am the master of my fate: I am the captain of my soul.”

What a magnificent soul it was.  We will miss him deeply.  May God bless the memory of Nelson Mandela.  May God bless the people of South Africa.

WEEKLY ADDRESS: Expanding Overtime Pay"," Hi everybody.  Last summer, I got a letter from a woman named Elizabeth Paredes from Tucson, Arizona.  Elizabeth is the mom of a 3-year-old boy, and an assistant manager at a sandwich shop.  She earns about $2,000 a month, and she routinely works some 50 hours a week, sometimes even more.  But because of outdated overtime regulations, she doesn’t have to be paid a dime of overtime. 

She wrote: “It’s not easy work and requires a lot of time away from my son… at times I find [it's] not worth it.”

Things like the 40-hour workweek and overtime are two of the most basic pillars of a middle class life.  But for all the changes we’ve seen in our economy, our overtime rules have only been updated once since the 1970s.  Just once.  In fact, forty years ago, more than 60 percent of workers were eligible for overtime based on their salaries.  But today, that number is down to seven percent.  Only seven percent of full-time salaried workers are eligible for overtime based on their income.

That’s why this week, my Administration took a step to help more workers get the overtime pay they’ve earned.  The Department of Labor finalized a rule to extend overtime protections to 4.2 million more Americans.  It’s a move that will boost wages for working Americans by $12 billion over the next 10 years.  We’re more than doubling the overtime salary threshold.  And what that means is, most salaried workers who earn less than about $47,500 a year will qualify for overtime.  Or, their employers can choose to give them a raise so that they earn more than $47,500.  Or, if employers don’t want to raise wages, they can let them go home after 40 hours and see their families or train for new jobs.  Any way you slice it, it’s a win for working families.  And we’re making sure that every three years, there will be an automatic update to this threshold – so that working families won’t fall through the cracks for decades at a time ever again.

This is the single biggest step I can take through executive action to raise wages for the American people.  It means that millions of hardworking Americans like Elizabeth will either get paid for working more than 40 hours, or they’ll get more time with their families.  Either way, they win.  The middle class wins.  And America wins.

We still have more work to do to make sure this economy works for everybody, not just those at the top.  That’s why I’ll never stop fighting for as long as I hold this office – to restore the sense that in America, hard work should be rewarded with the chance to get ahead.

Thanks everybody.  Have a great weekend. ",President,Barack Obama,https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/the-press-office/2016/05/21/weekly-address-expanding-overtime-pay,,DEVELOPMENT
United Kingdom,07-Nov-16,Theresa May,India-UK Tech Summit: Prime Minister's speech,"Prime Minister’s speech I am delighted to be here in India. Prime Minister Modi: not only did I take up your invitation as soon as I could; I chose to make this my first bilateral visit outside Europe as Prime Minister, and my first ever trade mission. I want to start by explaining why. It is because of the very special partnership between our countries – not just in the business that we do with one another, but the values we share: values of democracy, responsibility, the rule of law and fair play. With so much in common when it comes to trade, values, culture and, of course, people – with one and a half million people of Indian origin living in Britain – ours is a natural partnership. Look around India and Britain and you can see the evidence: we listen to each other’s music, eat each other’s food, and share a passionate rivalry with each other on the cricket pitch. And on that note, I am looking forward to the Test series that begins between England and India in Gujarat on Wednesday. When 2 countries are as old as India and the United Kingdom, it is tempting for many to look to the past, to talk about the years that have already gone, and to take for granted or make assumptions about the links that we have. Frankly, people in Britain have done that too often in the past. I don’t want to do that. I want to talk about the importance of this relationship today and the limitless possibilities that I believe will be open to us in the future. I will use this visit to discuss with Prime Minister Modi, his team, and Indian businesses how we can work together to seize those possibilities – building a partnership that is focussed resolutely on shaping our shared future, bilaterally, and on the global stage. Why trade and investment I have said we want Britain to be the most committed and most passionate advocate of free trade in the world. That is because free trade creates a rising tide that lifts all boats. It makes us all richer. It creates jobs. It increases investment. It improves productivity. It transforms living standards and creates opportunities for all of our citizens. These are the reasons we believe in free trade. It’s why – as Britain leaves the EU – we’re determined not to turn our backs on the world but to forge a new, global, outward-looking role for ourselves. Because we know from history what happens when countries do not embrace the opportunities of the world. They stagnate. They get poorer. They don’t protect their people; they make them worse off. Of course, no country owes any other country a living. But we stand the greatest chance of success when we work with partners with whom we share similar values, legal systems, approaches to business, and ways of looking at the world. That is why I’ve made my first trade mission, and first bilateral visit outside Europe, to India. Because more trade, more investment and fewer barriers to doing business in our 2 countries will make us all more prosperous, peaceful and secure. And within this unique partnership there is so much potential for us to advance those things. Our starting point We have a strong starting point, with Britain investing more in India than any other G20 country, and India investing more in Britain than it does in all other EU countries put together. Indian businesses – over 800 – are a fixture of British life, with one, Jaguar Land Rover’s owner Tata, our largest manufacturing employer. Right now, there are British businesses exporting everything from engines to insurance to India. So much of that is enabled by the fact that we have, between our 2 countries, this very special bond. But those things are happening despite the continued existence of the barriers to trade and barriers to co-operation. Just think how much further we could go if our governments worked even more closely together; if we took even more advantage of the links between us; and if we put not only trade and investment, but also the exchange of ideas, innovation and technology, at the heart of our ambitions. Going further There couldn’t be a more appropriate place to focus on that than at the UK-India Tech Summit, for this is where so much scope for that increased trade and investment lies. With 3 Indians experiencing the internet for the first time every second, with the country on course to be a digital market of one billion people, and with so many graduates launching start-ups from Mumbai to Hyderabad – or Cyberabad, as it’s known – this is an area filled with opportunities. Indeed, I’m looking forward to visiting Bengaluru tomorrow to see the start-up capital of India for myself. Again, we have a head start in this. We have Britain’s 3D printing tools in Pune, bringing solar power to the most remote parts of India, and funding Indian infrastructure through Masala Bonds. Today I want to think about how we, as governments, as businesses, and those with a stake in this relationship, can help to build upon that for our countries’ mutual benefit. First, we can identify where opportunities lie and which businesses can take advantage of them. That is exactly what we are doing with this delegation – bringing along some of our biggest, most successful companies and our brightest start-ups, from every region of the UK, in order to open up new markets for them and promote them to the wider world. One of them, Kano, is using its unique technology to teach children to code in UK schools. Just think of the impact that could have in India. Another, Telensa, is the foremost maker of smart street-lighting. There is a huge opportunity for them to play a role in India’s drive for urban renewal. Oxford Nanopore is another. They’re specialists in gene sequencing and could help dramatically reduce the costs involved in screening illnesses in India. Second, we can look upon each other’s priorities as our own priorities. As countries, we both need to ensure we take advantage of the opportunities of the century ahead. And we can do so together. As Prime Minister Modi pursues his ambition for Smart Cities, Digital India and Make in India, in Britain we are focused on economic reform, social reform and building a country that works for everyone. I believe we should throw our entire weight behind each other’s efforts. Indeed, we already have our urban planners working on your Smart Cities and making wi-fi more accessible across India; meanwhile, Indian investment is helping us diversify our economy and bring prosperity to every corner of our country. In fact, Prime Minister Modi and I are going even further, announcing a new India-UK Urban Partnership focusing on smart cities – the ultimate demonstration of our long-term relationship: not just trading, but sharing skills, technology and expertise. Third, and most importantly, we can break down barriers and make it easier to do business. That does not just mean offering our own incentives – as Britain is doing with the lowest corporation tax in the G7, with Export Finance and with tax breaks for those undertaking research and development in Britain. It means helping each other to break down the barriers to trade and investment in and between our countries. So that is why the UK is working side by side with Prime Minister Modi in his mission to make it easier to do business in India, for example by strengthening intellectual property rights and paving the way for our world-leading services sector to operate in the Indian market – benefitting India and the UK alike. But I am determined that we go further. I will be discussing with Prime Minister Modi how we can increase the detail and depth of our trade and investment discussions, and identify what more we can do, now, to unleash our businesses, industries, exporters and investors. This does not need to wait for us to leave the EU. We must also recognise that it is not just the legal frameworks that are essential for effective trade and investment – it is people too. It is crucial that those who do need to travel between our countries for business can do so. That is the reason why, when I was Home Secretary, I made the visa process for Indians much easier. India now has one of the best UK visa services in the world, with more application points than any other country, and the only country where it is possible to get a same-day visa. That happened because we listened to what businesses were saying. And we are still listening – listening to the fact that so many people from India want to bring their ideas, skills and business to Britain, for the good of your economy and ours. So we will offer, for the first time to any country that needs visas to enter Britain, what is called the Registered Traveller Scheme. This means that for Indian nationals who frequently come to the UK – and who fuel growth in both our countries – the entry process will become significantly easier. Fewer forms to fill out. Access to the EU/EEA passport control. Swifter passage through our airports. In short, more opportunities for Britain and India, and a clear message that Britain is very much open for business. Conclusion To conclude, I want to return to that argument I was making about the importance of free trade and investment. For we need to make this case around the world – not only to make our countries more prosperous, but to make them more stable and secure too. The UK and India can play a big role in that – we can lead the way – so even more nations can share in those things. That is one of the many things that, through this partnership between our countries, I hope Prime Minister Modi and I – and indeed, everyone in the room – can help to achieve. Thank you.

Russia,30-03-2020,Vladimir Putin,Meeting with Presidential Plenipotentiary Envoys,"Colleagues, good afternoon,

As you know, yesterday a list of instructions on the measures I mentioned in my Address to the Nation on March 25 was published. Some of them directly concern spheres under the responsibility of regional authorities. I am asking you as Presidential Plenipotentiary Envoys to ensure their implementation locally.

This fully applies to the decisions of the Government Coordination Council and the State Council working group to counter the spread of the coronavirus.

Let me note that effective cooperation between the local, regional and federal bodies and their joint work in the same tune and around the clock play a pivotal role.

There must be no complacency, but calm, confident and reliable work promoting Russians’ trust, including regular and objective updates about developments and measures taken. This is the best response to any provocations, stupid rumours and malicious assumptions.

I am addressing you as well as representatives of all government levels: our actions must be reasoned and professional. This is the approach that allowed us to gain time and restrain the explosive spread of the coronavirus over the course of the past weeks. We must use this time fully and effectively.

In this regard, I instruct you to establish monitoring in all vital areas. I will begin with the most important one: providing medical assistance to people who have contracted or may contract the disease. We are now doing our best to prevent large numbers of people from contracting the virus. But all regions must prepare for all possible scenarios based on the experience of other countries. We need to take every measure that is necessary in this situation. Even if some uninformed people consider them excessive. One cannot be too careful.

So, the first thing. I am addressing both you and regional heads: in the next few days it is necessary to complete a full inspection of the condition and readiness of medical facilities. This concerns the system of the Healthcare Ministry and the Federal Medical-Biological Agency, as well as state and private clinics and hospitals. All information must be compiled in an integrated database.

Also, you are personally responsible for making a detailed assessment of the actual readiness of bed capacity, and using all opportunities to increase the number of beds, if necessary. It is obvious that some hospitals will have to be temporarily turned into dedicated coronavirus treatment facilities. We need to provide these hospitals with all the necessary equipment and medical staff in accordance with the Healthcare Ministry standards.

Different regions have different numbers of beds. So it is already necessary to consider interregional cooperation plans, including the possibility of accepting patients from other regions, as well as allowing medical units and ambulance crews to visit areas beyond their region. I instruct the Government in such cases to compensate regional budgets from the federal centre.

Second, it is necessary to quickly load all the lab capacities and establish additional diagnostics centres both at state and private medical institutions. We must do it to increase the number of coronavirus tests in the next few days.

Also assess the capabilities of the specialised institutions in order for them to take part in the production of effective test systems. A whole number of such systems have already been created in Russia. I ask you to provide for the quick registration of new test systems. Please don’t delay it. Use both Russian and foreign examples where needed. Now we must use all the opportunities, and we have them. We continue working with our foreign partners.

Third, ventilators are in high demand to treat serious coronavirus-related complications. I am also asking you to count the inventory here. We must get the full picture of how many ventilators we have and their real readiness to be used, including spare parts and expendable materials.

We must replenish our reserve of ventilators. And, of course, we will also need people who know how to work with such equipment and have the necessary training. I am asking you to support the organisational side of additional training for doctors on how to use such equipment. I can see that in most cases our medical personnel show amazing self-sacrifice, professionalism and discipline. We must support them. There must be no deficit in human resources regardless of how the situation develops.

In general it is obvious that the burden on specialists, such as pulmonologists, resuscitators, therapists and paramedics, will increase significantly. This is why you and your colleagues must think right now about measures to involve doctors specialising in other areas as well as medical residents, professors and teachers at medical universities, if necessary. It is also important to ensure the necessary number of mid-level healthcare personnel, including with the involvement of students from medical institutions and interns.

In your turn, you must constantly monitor that all payments related to the special working schedule of doctors, nurses, other medical personnel and paramedics are made strictly on time. All the necessary resources have been allocated.

Fourth, the most important issue: the supply of medications. There must be an additional reserve of all the medications used now to treat the coronavirus and its complications.

Fifth, special focus should be on the elderly who are in the risk group today. Explanatory work is very important here. Everyone – people over 65 and their families – should know that people in this age group must stay home now. They must be told: if you want to stay healthy and alive, you must stay home. We care about you. Please care about yourselves too.

Of course, it is also important to provide support and medical aid, and monitor their health, as well as to deliver them food, medicine and other necessities. They must be able to quickly request help and report problems. Colleagues, I am asking you to personally oversee this area of work together with heads of the regions. This is very important. It is already being done by social services and volunteers. And they deserve special thanks for it.

I am once again addressing all Russians: please do all you can to look out for your mums and dads of this age as well as your grandparents. They always need our support, help, affection and attention, but especially now.

Now to preventive measures taken to contain the spread of the virus.

The fact that we have prevented the scenario a number of countries are facing now is mostly due to our epidemiologists. They have been working non-stop in recent months. Everyone must carefully follow their guidelines and orders. Please stay on top of this and oversee things.

First, the most important task at this stage is to contain potential sources of transmission as much as possible.

And so I am asking you to work with federal and regional bodies to establish a procedure to identify those who have returned to Russia from countries with serious coronavirus outbreaks over the last two weeks or will return soon. They must stay in quarantine or self-isolation; their health and the health of their families must be monitored; and the people with whom they have had contact and may have infected must be identified.

This is work that has to be done on the ground. I want to emphasise this: it must be done on the ground, not just on paper or in reports. No exceptions.

Second. Moscow and the Moscow Region have introduced restrictions and mandatory self-isolation. This measure is justified and necessary for a huge agglomeration with millions of people, the first to encounter the coronavirus. I am asking Muscovites and residents of the Moscow Region to take these forced but absolutely necessary preventive and restrictive measures very seriously. We are talking about your health and safety, and the lives of those near you.

Third. Measures have been adopted all across Russia to limit operations of facilities that are visited by a large number of people. These are clubs, cinemas, shopping malls and other places. At the same time, unfortunately, not everyone follows the regime, while local authorities turn a blind eye on these violations. I believe that this is not just a lack of discipline and common sense. This is criminal negligence, and you should treat it accordingly.

I ask you to control and ensure scrupulous compliance with all restrictive measures, to work together with law enforcement agencies and control bodies and to react to citizens’ complaints.

Fourth. As I already said, all vital structures, including places selling basic goods, pharmacies, utility systems, process industries and government agencies will continue operating this week. But they also need to conform to enhanced safety requirements. It concerns, first of all, strict compliance with sanitary standards and regular disinfecting. They also have to provide personnel with individual means of protection.

Stores and pharmacies need to follow a special servicing procedure to prevent people from staying close to each other in queues. Experts say that 1.5–2 metres is the recommended distance between people. I hope everyone already knows this. It is important.

As for the so-called process industries and government agencies, it is important to introduce flexible working hours and if possible switch to working remotely. I ask you to monitor this carefully and to establish constant direct contacts with employers and heads of enterprises, regardless of the form of incorporation. It is important that enterprises producing goods that are in high demand today continue their operations.

The next set of issues I would like to discuss with you concerns the socioeconomic situation and the tasks of federal and regional bodies to ensure its stability.

In this regard, first: we have the necessary stock of essential goods, but I am still asking you to constantly monitor the situation together with your colleagues in the regions, prevent local problems in the retail segment, and, what is very important for people, control the prices of food, medicines, personal protective gear and other goods that are in demand now.

It is necessary to fully prevent any attempts to restrict trade flows between regions. We have had such a situation in the recent past. I would like to stress that our country is one big family. However, as they say, every family has its black sheep. This is why I am asking you to firmly prevent any price gouging or monopoly price increases.

Second, all the measures taken at the regional level must be sensible and coordinated. The regional authorities have to quickly agree their actions and inform the Government and the State Council working group. I am asking the Presidential Plenipotentiary Envoys to ensure strict compliance with this coordination procedure.

Third, the list of systemically important enterprises and industries that require special monitoring has already been created at the federal level.

Every region in its turn must create such a list, as they say, manually. There is no need to be afraid of this. We must ensure these enterprises remain operational as this also means jobs.

I am asking you to support the regions, including on coordinating the work of local enterprises and banks operating in the regions.

Let me add that the Government will ensure the replenishment of the regional guarantee funds so that the regions will have additional capacities to support business loans locally. I am asking the Cabinet to increase the financing of these programmes and speed up the allocation of funds. Please do not delay.

Fourth. I understand that tax deferrals and other measures to support small and medium-sized businesses and sole proprietors will affect regional budgets. They may see a shortfall in revenue.

But I want to emphasise and remind our colleagues from the regions that despite this situation, current budget expenditures should not be cut. On the contrary, the task now is to fully fund all planned programmes and contracts as quickly as possible, without a hitch. These funds are urgently needed by the economy. They must be put to work protecting people’s jobs and incomes and keeping businesses stable.

Naturally, regional budgets should receive the necessary additional support. Already now the Russian regions have the opportunity to use treasury loans to cover so-called cash gaps. But we cannot limit ourselves to this short-term measure alone; it is not enough.

I am instructing the Government and the Finance Ministry to develop a set of systemic steps and provide the necessary funding to ensure the sustainability of regional budgets. I also ask the Presidential Envoys to join in this work and in solving this problem, to help objectively assess the needs of the regions for additional support, and, of course, to monitor – I want to emphasise this – the targeted nature and efficient spending of these funds on the ground.

And in general, I’m asking you not just to monitor the situation closely, but also do that on a daily basis. Let me remind you, for example, that by May 10, the authorities in all regions must finish submitting all information from civil registry offices to tax authorities. This is necessary so that in June, as I said in my Address to the Nation, we can start making payments to families with children from three to seven years old inclusively. Please provide the regions with all the necessary information and methodological support to implement this and other instructions.

Let us get down to work. Please report on the situation on the ground.

USA,22-02-2017 00:00,Donald Trump,Remarks by President Trump in Budget Meeting,"THE PRESIDENT: Thank you all. This will be somewhat of an informal meeting. I want to congratulate Mick Mulvaney, who’s been confirmed finally — we waited a long time — by the Senate. And he’s going to be an absolutely great director. Total confidence in Mick. Known him for a long time. He loves those budgets.

Unfortunately, the budget we’re inheriting — essentially inheriting — is a mess. The finances of our country are a mess. But we’re going to clean them up. Things that we’ve been doing, including negotiating deals that have already been negotiated, so you call it re-negotiating — on airplanes and lots of other things, military items — we’ll end up either getting many more planes free, or we’re going to save a lot of money. But we’ve already saved a lot; billions and billions of dollars have been saved.

We have enormous work to do as the national debt doubled over the last eight years. Our debt has doubled over a short period of time. I want the American people to know that our budget will reflect their priorities. We’ll be directing all of our departments and agencies to protect every last American and every last tax dollar. No more wasted money.

We’re going to be spending the money in a very, very careful manner. Our moral duty to the taxpayer requires us to make our government leaner and more accountable. We must do a lot more with less. And we must stop the improper payments and the abuses, negotiate better prices, and look for every last dollar of savings.

We’ve already imposed hiring freezes on nonessential government workers, and part of our commitment is to continue to do that for the American taxpayer. We have appointed a Cabinet that knows how to manage dollars wisely. I’ve known many of the folks for a long time. They’ve been tremendous winners — whether it’s Steve or Gary or another Steve, right here. And that’s why I will direct them to manage the country’s dollars and your dollars very wisely. We won’t let your money be wasted anymore. We’re going to run government smoothly, efficiently, and on behalf of the very hardworking taxpayers — something that the taxpayers haven’t seen in a long time. I will be holding everybody accountable for that, and I have no doubt that this group — in particular, this group will do a fantastic job.

I want to congratulate Steve Mnuchin as our new Secretary of the Treasury. He’s going to be outstanding. Tremendous track record — he has a tremendous track record. I have great confidence in him.

So we’re going to continue on, and we’re going to take this budget, which is — in all fairness, I’ve only been here for four weeks, so I can’t take too much of the blame for what’s happened. But it is absolutely out of control, and we’re going to do things that are going to be tremendous over the years. We have to take care of our military. We have no choice, we have to take care of our military. It needs work; it’s very depleted. And we have to take care of a lot of other things.

Healthcare is moving along nicely. It’s being put into final forms. As you know, before we do the tax — which is actually very well finalized — but we can’t submit it until the healthcare, statutorily or otherwise. So we’re doing the healthcare. Again, moving along very well. Sometime during the month of March, maybe mid- to early March we will be submitting something that I think people will be very impressed by.

And with that, we’re going to have a little meeting. And I think the press knows pretty much all of the people at the table, so thank you very much. We appreciate it.",President,Donald Trump,https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefings-statements/remarks-president-trump-budget-meeting/,,DEVELOPMENT
China,24-08-2020 00:00,Li Keqiang,"Speech by H.E. Li Keqiang
Premier of the State Council of
The People's Republic of China
At the Third Lancang-Mekong Cooperation Leaders' Meeting","Your Excellency Prime Minister Thongloun Sisoulith,
Colleagues,

I am delighted to meet you via video link for the third Lancang-Mekong Cooperation (LMC) Leaders' Meeting. I wish to thank our co-chair the Lao PDR and Prime Minister Thongloun for the tremendous efforts made for the meeting.

We meet today under the theme of ""Enhancing Partnership for Shared Prosperity"". President Xi Jinping recently called for making global governance more inclusive, multilateral frameworks more effective and regional cooperation more active. Drinking water from the same river, we, the LMC countries, are close as one family living in a community with a shared future. Enhancing mutually beneficial cooperation is both conducive to our own interests and contributing to others' success, as it will boost our economic and social development and people's well-being, and cement the foundation for regional prosperity and stability.

The Chinese believe that the supreme good is like water; water nurtures all living things without competing with them. The launch of the LMC has been motivated by a river, which is both an important part of our cooperation and an inspiration for the LMC spirit of friendship and mutual benefit.

Over the past four years, the LMC has grown rapidly and entered a period of all-round development, in which notable progress has been made in institution building, strategic planning, financial support and practical cooperation. The LMC has become a new fountain of strength for regional development and delivered real benefits to people of our countries.

We have brought the cooperation mechanisms on water resources onto a fast track. We held the first Ministerial Meeting on Lancang-Mekong Water Resources Cooperation and the first Water Resources Cooperation Forum. China directly provided flood-season hydrological data of the Lancang River to the Mekong countries and offered timely updates on upstream flow changes. Despite its own difficulties, China increased outbound water flow in the drought season to help downstream countries mitigate droughts. Solid cooperation has also been carried out under the Water Resources Cooperation Center, the Environmental Cooperation Center and the Global Center for Mekong River Studies.

We have strengthened economic cooperation and trade ties, which gave a strong boost to our economic growth. Drawing from the special credit line for industrial capacity and equipment manufacturing cooperation, the concessional loans for foreign aid and preferential export buyers' credit, China has supported over 40 major projects including the Siem Reap New International Airport, the Kyaukpyu deep-water port and the Vinh Tan Coal-fired Power Plant. Chinese companies are actively involved in building the Sihanoukville Special Economic Zone, the Rayong Industrial Zone and the Saysettha Development Zone, generating tax revenues and jobs for host countries and achieving mutual benefit.

We have put people first in the LMC and increased their well-being. The LMC Special Fund is heavily invested in improving people's lives and has sponsored over 400 programs in health, education, poverty reduction and women's welfare. The Fund has supported 40,000-plus training opportunities for people in the Mekong countries, bringing out the region's potential of human resources.

Faced with COVID-19 since early this year, we have pulled together and supported each other in combating the virus and reviving regional growth. In the first half of this year, China's trade with and investment in the Mekong countries grew by 8.7% and 33.5% respectively, bucking the trend of global slowdown. Mekong countries saw their agricultural exports to China rise by 21.2% over the same period last year. Tracks are being laid along the China-Laos Railway at a pace of one kilometer per day. Construction of the expressway linking Phnom Penh and Sihanoukville and other key projects has been resumed. The above progress has helped regional countries get their economic and social development back to normal.

Colleagues,

In the context of a fluid and complex international situation and severe shocks to the global and regional economies, we face the common task of sustaining the good momentum of our cooperation to help tackle risks and challenges and achieve shared progress. To this end, China wishes to propose the following:

- We need to take our cooperation in water resources to a new high. The legitimate rights and interests of all countries in developing and utilizing their water resources as appropriate should be fully respected. Meanwhile, we need to accommodate each other's interests and concerns, and advance cooperation by building consensus.

China is ready to provide more help to the best of its ability for the Mekong countries to make better use of water resources. Starting from this year, China will share Lancang River's hydrological data for the whole year with the Mekong countries. China will work with your countries to establish a Lancang-Mekong Water Resources Cooperation Information Sharing Platform to help us better tackle climate change and natural disasters such as floods and droughts.

We need to hold the Ministerial Meeting of Lancang-Mekong Water Resources Cooperation and the Water Resources Cooperation Forum on a regular basis, fully implement the Five-Year Action Plan on Lancang-Mekong Water Resources Cooperation (2018-2022) and deliver the cooperation projects on dam safety and flood early warning to enhance our capacity for integrated river basin management and water resources management.

- We need to expand trade ties and connectivity cooperation. China is ready to further synergize the Belt and Road Initiative with your development strategies for deeper cooperation among us.

The New International Land-Sea Trade Corridor runs through western China and connects Southeast Asia with the Eurasian continent. By harnessing the transportation routes over both land and sea, the Corridor is exerting a positive impact on the interconnected development across different regions. Greater synergy between the LMC and the New Trade Corridor will make trade routes more convenient and enable the leveraging of more resources from western and southwestern China and other ASEAN countries, and thus channel more inputs to the Mekong countries. This will help optimize the allocation of resources, keep industrial and supply chains stable, and spur coordinated development.

China is ready to work with the Mekong countries to fully implement the Co-Chairs' Statement on Cooperation of Synergizing the Lancang-Mekong Cooperation and the New International Land-Sea Trade Corridor adopted at the meeting, and inject new impetus into regional development.

We also need to work toward signing the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) agreement within this year to raise regional economic integration to a higher level and jointly uphold free trade.

We need to ensure the success of the China-Laos and the China-Thailand railways as part of the regional transportation arteries linking the south and the north.

Industrial cooperation should be boosted, including expeditiously drafting the Five-Year Development Plan for LMC Cross-Border Economic Cooperation and intensifying Multi-Nation Multi-Park cooperation.

Financial cooperation should be deepened to provide strong, sustainable financial support for connectivity.

With COVID-19 control as a ""new normal"", we need to build a network of ""fast tracks"" and ""green lanes"" across the region to facilitate the flow of people and goods, and keep industrial and supply chains stable.

The Internet economy buoyed by epidemic control needs should be further developed. We should advance innovation in digital technology and expand digital connectivity to fuel the digital transformation and upgrading of our economy and society.

- We need to deepen cooperation on sustainable development. We need to implement the Three-Year Action Plan on Agricultural Cooperation (2020-2022) at a faster pace and ensure the success of the LMC Bumper Harvest projects. We need to disseminate and share technologies on crop processing and agro-product storage, upgrade the agro-product quality and safety systems, and build agro-industrial parks to strengthen our sub-region's competitiveness in agriculture. China welcomes more quality agro-products, livestock and by-products from Mekong countries.

We also need to expedite the implementation of the Lancang-Mekong Environmental Cooperation Strategy, and step up cooperation to tackle climate change, improve air quality, and protect biodiversity.

- We need to upgrade cooperation on public health. China will set up a special fund for public health under the framework of the LMC Special Fund, and continue to provide material and technical support to Mekong countries to the best of our ability.

Once developed and deployed in China, COVID-19 vaccines will be provided to Mekong countries on a priority basis.

We need to carry out information sharing and joint responses in major public health emergencies, and strengthen cooperation in early warning on communicable diseases. Public health projects such as the Joint Control Action for Tropical Diseases, Materia Medica and Chinese Acupuncture-Moxibustion benefiting Mekong countries will be taken forward.

International solidarity and cooperation is crucial for the global fight against COVID-19. China will work with Mekong countries to support the World Health Organization (WHO) in better playing its role.

- We need to strengthen cooperation on people's livelihood. China will work with Mekong countries to jointly implement projects on disaster prevention and mitigation, sanitation and health in rural areas, and infant and young child nutrition and health to benefit more people and communities. The integrated development of underdeveloped communities and business start-ups in ethnic regions will be promoted through cooperation programs.

We need to revitalize tourism by holding events like the Lancang-Mekong Mayors' Culture and Tourism Forum, exploring flexible ways such as ""cloud tourism"", and fully capitalizing on our multi-ethnic culture and world heritage sites. This will foster a new format for the growth of tourism alongside regular COVID-19 response.

- We need to uphold the spirit of openness and inclusiveness. We will strengthen exchanges and mutual learning between various cooperation frameworks. The LMC's interaction and cooperation with the Greater Mekong Subregion Economic Cooperation Program (GMS), the Ayeyawady-Chao Phraya-Mekong Economic Cooperation Strategy (ACMECS) and the Mekong River Commission (MRC) will be facilitated, including experience sharing and joint programs. We will actively explore cooperation with Japan, the ROK, the EU and other third parties.

China supports ASEAN centrality in East Asian cooperation. By promoting Lancang-Mekong cooperation, we hope to contribute to ASEAN's community building and deepen the China-ASEAN strategic partnership.

Colleagues,

This year, the Chinese government has scaled up macro policy response to cushion the shock of COVID-19. While going all out to contain the virus, we lost no time in reopening the economy. Our measures to help businesses get through the tough times and reinvigorate the market are paying off.

Thanks to these efforts, we have achieved significant progress in both COVID-19 response and socio-economic development. The economy is steadily recovering. Business activities are picking up month by month. Growth in the second quarter exceeded expectations. Economic structure is improving. The digital and intelligent transformation of industries is notably speeding up. Reform and opening up are further deepening.

Given the strong resilience and latitude of the Chinese economy, and with hard work, we will be able to deliver positive growth for the whole year. China's development will create even more cooperation opportunities for Mekong countries and the rest of the world.

Colleagues,

Running through nearly 5,000 kilometers, the Lancang-Mekong River admits countless streams along the way and nourishes all people living on its banks. To strengthen Lancang-Mekong cooperation requires the same open and inclusive spirit and the combined efforts from all sectors in order to usher in a brighter future for people in the sub-region.

China welcomes our new co-chair Myanmar. We look forward to working with the Mekong countries to deepen and expand Lancang-Mekong cooperation, and provide stronger impetus for the development and prosperity in our sub-region and beyond.

Thank you.",Premier,Xi Jinping,https://www.fmprc.gov.cn/mfa_eng/wjdt_665385/zyjh_665391/t1808937.shtml,,INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS
Russia,05-09-2018 00:00,Vladimir Putin,Military parade on Red Square,"Citizens of Russia,

Veterans, soldiers and seamen, sergeants and master sergeants, warrant officers and chief warrant officers, officers, generals and admirals,

Congratulations on Victory Day!

This holiday has always been and will always be the dearest, most sacred day for each family, for all our huge country, a day of national pride and eternal unfailing memory.

Seventy-three years ago, the Great Patriotic War ended, Nazism was crushed and its atrocities, outrages and barbarity were terminated, and plans for world domination were defeated.

    We must cherish the memory of the courage of the warriors who gave their lives, of all our soldiers and the brave fighters of the Second Front, of the contribution made by the anti-Hitler coalition countries, of the brotherhood-in-arms of those who stood up against Nazism.

The defeat of the Nazis was a tremendous triumphant Victory. This long-awaited word immediately circled the planet. All countries, all people back then understood that the outcome of World War II was determined by the Soviet Union, that this great sacrificial feat was achieved by our soldiers and our people.

It gained Victory at the cost of the hardest, irreplaceable losses; it defended the honour and independence of our homeland thanks to unparalleled courage on the frontlines and on the home front. However, attempts are made today to cross out this deed of the people who saved Europe and the world from slavery, from the horrors of the Holocaust, to distort the events of the war, to bury the true heroes in oblivion, to forge, rewrite and corrupt history itself.

We will never let this happen. We must cherish the memory of the courage of the warriors who gave their lives, of all our soldiers and the brave fighters of the Second Front, of the contribution made by the anti-Hitler coalition countries, of the brotherhood-in-arms of those who stood up against Nazism.

We will always take pride in the fact that the Soviet people stood its ground and did not yield to the cruel enemy, while some countries preferred the disgrace of capitulation, hypocritical compromise or direct cooperation with the Nazis.

Our people fought to the death. No other country repelled such an invasion, evacuated under enemy fire millions of people and thousands of factories, which practically off the wheels started manufacturing equipment and munitions for the front.

The impossible was achieved. Nobody thought of themselves and everyone worked heroically, including women and children. For the Motherland, for Victory. For those who were defending our country, their families in the thick of the war.

    May 9 unites generations through a history of courage. Each family has its own heroes, who live on in our hearts. They are with us in the ranks of the Immortal Regiment.

The courage of our warriors is immeasurable. All of them, from a private to a general, fought in the cold and the heat, in small and large battlefields. Each military line was part of the Fatherland, and for that reason, every one of them was the most important.

Our troops won great victories in the decisive Battles of Moscow and Stalingrad, in the battles near Kursk and on the Dnieper, broke the siege of Leningrad and liberated European capitals. They took Berlin in the conclusive assault.

Their background did not matter throughout that time: where they came from, what their ethnicity or religion was, which region of the vast country they lived in before the war, and whether they were drafted to join the army or volunteered for the front.

Everyone had one Motherland. Everyone fought as much as they could, until the last round, until the last drop of blood.

May 9 unites generations through a history of courage. Each family has its own heroes, who live on in our hearts. They are with us in the ranks of the Immortal Regiment.

We bow to the cherished memory of all those who did not come back from the war, to the sons, daughters, fathers, mothers, grandfathers, husbands, wives, sisters, fellow-soldiers, relatives and friends. We mourn the veterans who passed away.

Let us observe a minute of silence.

(A minute of silence.)

Friends,

In June 1941, war entered every home, separating loved ones, many of them – forever. It orphaned and bereaved hundreds of thousands of children, destroying hopes and plans, incinerating towns and villages.

    Russia is open for dialogue on all issues related to ensuring global security; it is ready for a constructive equal partnership for the sake of agreement, peace and progress on the planet.

War is always a challenge to life itself and to all the best it offers.

We remember the tragedies of the two world wars; the lessons of history do not let us ‘go blind.’ New threats bear the same old ugly features: selfishness and intolerance, aggressive nationalism and claims to exclusiveness.

We are aware of the seriousness of these threats. It is important for all countries, all humankind to realise that peace is very fragile, and its stability is enhanced by our common commitment to hear, trust and respect each other.

Russia is open for dialogue on all issues related to ensuring global security; it is ready for a constructive equal partnership for the sake of agreement, peace and progress on the planet.

Esteemed veterans,

Our gratitude to you knows no limits; our hearts speak about it now. A military parade will be held in honour of your services to the Fatherland.

USA,25-06-2015,Barack Obama,"
Remarks by the President on the Supreme Court's Ruling of the Affordable Care Act","Good morning, everybody.  Have a seat.  Five years ago, after nearly a century of talk, decades of trying, a year of bipartisan debate -- we finally declared that in America, health care is not a privilege for a few, but a right for all.

Over those five years, as we’ve worked to implement the Affordable Care Act, there have been successes and setbacks.  The setbacks I remember clearly.  (Laughter.)  But as the dust has settled, there can be no doubt that this law is working.  It has changed, and in some cases saved, American lives.  It set this country on a smarter, stronger course.

And today, after more than 50 votes in Congress to repeal or weaken this law; after a presidential election based in part on preserving or repealing this law; after multiple challenges to this law before the Supreme Court -- the Affordable Care Act is here to stay.

This morning, the Court upheld a critical part of this law -– the part that’s made it easier for Americans to afford health insurance regardless of where you live.  If the partisan challenge to this law had succeeded, millions of Americans would have had thousands of dollars’ worth of tax credits taken from them.  For many, insurance would have become unaffordable again.  Many would have become uninsured again.  Ultimately, everyone’s premiums could have gone up.  America would have gone backwards.  And that’s not what we do.  That’s not what America does.  We move forward.

So today is a victory for hardworking Americans all across this country whose lives will continue to become more secure in a changing economy because of this law.

If you’re a parent, you can keep your kids on your plan until they turn 26 -- something that has covered millions of young people so far.  That’s because of this law.

If you’re a senior, or an American with a disability, this law gives you discounts on your prescriptions -- something that has saved 9 million Americans an average of $1,600 so far.

If you’re a woman, you can’t be charged more than anybody else -- even if you’ve had cancer, or your husband had heart disease, or just because you’re a woman.  Your insurer has to offer free preventive services like mammograms.  They can’t place annual or lifetime caps on your care because of this law.

Because of this law, and because of today’s decision, millions of Americans who I hear from every single day will continue to receive the tax credits that have given about eight in ten people who buy insurance on the new marketplaces the choice of a health care plan that costs less than $100 a month.

And when it comes to preexisting conditions -- someday, our grandkids will ask us if there was really a time when America discriminated against people who get sick.  Because that is something this law has ended for good.  That affects everybody with health insurance -- not just folks who got insurance through the Affordable Care Act.  All of America has protections it didn’t have before. 

As the law’s provisions have gradually taken effect, more than 16 million uninsured Americans have gained coverage so far.  Nearly one in three Americans who was uninsured a few years ago is insured today.  The uninsured rate in America is the lowest since we began to keep records.  And that is something we can all be proud of. 

Meanwhile, the law has helped hold the price of health care to its slowest growth in 50 years.  If your family gets insurance through your job -- so you’re not using the Affordable Care Act -- you’re still paying about $1,800 less per year on average than you would be if we hadn’t done anything.  By one leading measure, what business owners pay out in wages and salaries is now finally growing faster than what they spend on health insurance.  That hasn’t happened in 17 years -- and that’s good for workers and it’s good for the economy.

The point is, this is not an abstract thing anymore.  This is not a set of political talking points.  This is reality.  We can see how it is working.  This law is working exactly as it’s supposed to.  In many ways, this law is working better than we expected it to.  For all the misinformation campaigns, all the doomsday predictions, all the talk of death panels and job destruction, for all the repeal attempts -- this law is now helping tens of millions of Americans. 

And they’ve told me that it has changed their lives for the better.  I’ve had moms come up and say, my son was able to see a doctor and get diagnosed, and catch a tumor early, and he’s alive today because of this law.  This law is working.  And it’s going to keep doing just that. 

Five years in, this is no longer about a law.  This is not about the Affordable Care Act as legislation, or Obamacare as a political football.  This is health care in America.

And unlike Social Security or Medicare, a lot of Americans still don’t know what Obamacare is beyond all the political noise in Washington.  Across the country, there remain people who are directly benefitting from the law but don’t even know it.  And that’s okay.  There’s no card that says “Obamacare” when you enroll.  But that’s by design, for this has never been a government takeover of health care, despite cries to the contrary.  This reform remains what it’s always been:  a set of fairer rules and tougher protections that have made health care in America more affordable, more attainable, and more about you -- the consumer, the American people.  It’s working.

And with this case behind us, let’s be clear -- we’ve still got work to do to make health care in America even better.  We’ll keep working to provide consumers with all the tools you need to make informed choices about your care.  We’ll keep working to increase the use of preventive care that avoids bigger problems down the road.  We’ll keep working to boost the steadily improving quality of care in hospitals, and bring down costs even lower, make the system work even better.  Already we’ve seen reductions, for example, in the number of readmissions at hospitals.  That saves our society money, it saves families money, makes people healthier.

We’re making progress.  We’re going to keep working to get more people covered.  I’m going to work as hard as I can to convince more governors and state legislatures to take advantage of the law, put politics aside, and expand Medicaid and cover their citizens.  We’ve still got states out there that, for political reasons, are not covering millions of people that they could be covering, despite the fact that the federal government is picking up the tab.

So we’ve got more work to do.  But what we’re not going to do is unravel what has now been woven into the fabric of America.  And my greatest hope is that rather than keep refighting battles that have been settled again and again and again, I can work with Republicans and Democrats to move forward.  Let’s join together, make health care in America even better.

Three generations ago, we chose to end an era when seniors were left to languish in poverty.  We passed Social Security, and slowly it was woven into the fabric of America and made a difference in the lives of millions of people.  Two generations ago, we chose to end an age when Americans in their golden years didn’t have the guarantee of health care.  Medicare was passed, and it helped millions of people.

This generation of Americans chose to finish the job -- to turn the page on a past when our citizens could be denied coverage just for being sick.  To close the books on a history where tens of millions of Americans had no hope of finding decent, affordable health care; had to hang their chances on fate.  We chose to write a new chapter, where in a new economy, Americans are free to change their jobs or start a business, chase a new idea, raise a family, free from fear, secure in the knowledge that portable, affordable health care is there for us and always will be.  And that if we get sick, we’re not going to lose our home.  That if we get sick, that we’re going to be able to still look after our families.

That’s when America soars -– when we look out for one another.  When we take care of each other.  When we root for one another’s success.  When we strive to do better and to be better than the generation that came before us, and try to build something better for generations to come.  That’s why we do what we do.  That’s the whole point of public service. 

So this was a good day for America.  Let’s get back to work.  (Applause.) ",President,Barack Obama,https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/the-press-office/2015/06/25/remarks-president-supreme-courts-ruling-affordable-care-act,,DEVELOPMENT

China,22-01-2014 00:00,Li Keqiang,"Li Keqiang: Reshaping the world economy through reform, opening up and cooperation","A new year marks a new beginning and brings new hope. The World Economic Forum is a barometer for observing the world economy and an important platform of global brainstorming. I believe that with both new positive signs and uncertainties in the world economy, the Forum will certainly pool wisdom, spread confidence and contribute advice.

China is the largest developing country in the world and a member of the G20, the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) and other multilateral economic mechanisms. Its economic health and trends have a major impact on the world economy.

Currently, the Chinese economy, while maintaining stability, has taken a turn for the better, with notable achievements and improved performance. In 2013, China's gross domestic product (GDP) grew by 7.7%, which remains mid-to-high growth in the world. The rise of the consumer price index (CPI) was kept at 2.6%. Over 13 million new urban jobs were created, more than in any previous year, and per capita disposable income of urban residents and per capita net income of rural residents rose by 7% and 9.3% in real terms, respectively.

The Chinese economy, on the whole, has enjoyed good momentum of fairly fast growth, relatively stable price levels, expanding employment and income increase. China's economy has become more closely connected with the world economy and China's cooperation with the world is further widening. Last year, China's import, export and use of overseas investment all achieved considerable growth. Total imports approached $2 trillion. Overseas direct investment by Chinese enterprises exceeded $90 billion. Given the lingering international financial crisis, the unrecovered world economy and China's effort of economic restructuring and upgrading, such a ""score report"" is indeed a hard-won achievement, proving once again the resilience and vitality of the Chinese economy.

Yet there is something more important than those figures. Last year, despite the sluggish global economy, the once increasing downward pressure on the Chinese economy and some outside prediction that our economy might have a hard landing, we didn't resort to short-term stimulus policies such as increasing the deficit or monetary expansion. Instead, we took proactive steps to boost economic vitality, stabilize expectations and promote economic transformation. Our focus was to innovate the approach to macro-regulation and rise to the challenges.

First, we started by reforming and opening up. We focused on properly handling relations between the government and the market. We vigorously streamlined governance and delegated power so as to release the dividends of reform. We slashed the number of items to be approved by government at various levels and pushed forward financial reform to make the interest rates of loans more market-based. We established the China (Shanghai) Pilot Free Trade Zone, instituted a ""negative list"" management model and relaxed market access. These measures fuelled market vitality and the internal driving force for economic growth and stimulated the enthusiasm of private investment. Last year, the number of newly registered private enterprises reached 2.33 million, up by 30% from the previous year.

Second, we defined a reasonable range of economic operation. The floor we set was a growth rate of about 7.5% and the creation of over 9 million urban jobs. The ceiling was to cap CPI growth at around 3.5%. As long as the economy operates within this reasonable range, we will be able to maintain stability of macroeconomic policies and achieve steady growth by mainly relying on structural reform and market forces. This has significantly boosted market confidence and stabilized people's expectations. Since the second half of last year, China's purchasing manager's index has climbed steadily above the tipping point of 50%.

Third, we readjusted the structure with intensive efforts. We introduced measures to tap the huge market potential and address ""weak links"" where development is needed. We stepped up development of the service industry by introducing policy measures to promote growth in information, finance, old-age care and health services. We also promoted energy-saving, environmentally friendly and other emerging industries. We persisted in our effort to drive domestic demand and improve supply through structural readjustment and to boost domestic demand through greater openness. And we continued to allow domestic demand to act as the main driver of growth. These measures do not just serve immediate interests. More importantly, they will generate long-term benefit. Last year, the share of services in China's GDP rose to 46.1%, surpassing that of the secondary sector for the first time. And energy intensity per unit of GDP was reduced by 3.7% from the previous year.

China's innovative ideas and approaches and new experience in macro-regulation will help ensure that the economy continues to perform well this year and beyond. Moreover, given the numerous uncertainties in the global economy and the unusual sensitivities of the international market to macro-policy developments in major economies, the stable fiscal and monetary policy and reasonable liquidity in China have combined to send a clear signal that stabilizes the international market's expectations. This is also an act of responsibility by China in the interest of world economic development.

The keynote of China's economic policy this year is to seek steady progress through reform and innovation. In my view, this is consistent with international expectations for reshaping the world economy. We will follow the arrangements made at the Third Plenum of the 18th Communist Party of China Central Committee, comprehensively deepen reform, continue to open up, maintain the continuity and consistency of macro-policies, actively boost domestic demand, and promote steady economic growth. When readjusting the structure, we will focus more on quality, efficiency and upgrading. We will work even harder to narrow the two major gaps between urban and rural areas and among different regions. We will take more effective measures to create more jobs, reduce poverty and help those in need. This will lead to greater social equity and enable the entire population to share in the benefits of development. The sustained and sound development of the Chinese economy will also offer new opportunities and inject new impetus to development of the world.

The international financial crisis that started in 2008 and the difficulties facing world economic recovery in the following years have raised many new tasks for the adjustment and improvement of the world economic system and architecture. Some economies have shown clear signs of recovery. But there remain uncertainties and factors that are not conducive to stability. All these cry out for in-depth adjustment and change. I therefore find it most fitting and relevant that the Forum convenes its Annual Meeting with ""the reshaping of the world"" as its theme.

To reshape the world economy, it is important to institute and improve an open, cooperative and win-win global economic and trade system. The international community should continue to work towards diversity, openness, inclusiveness and mutual benefit, and uphold the post-World War II international political order and the world environment for peace. It should enable the multilateral trading framework with the World Trade Organization at the centre to play a more positive role. It should explore regional trade arrangements in various forms, and resolutely reject trade and investment protectionism. China maintains that economies at different development levels and phases should embrace the spirit of solidarity in difficult times, discard zero-sum practices, and join hands to meet common challenges. Developed and emerging economies in particular should bring out their respective strengths to drive global economic growth by acting as the ""double engines"" of the global economy, reinforcing and benefitting each other. This way, we will open up a new prospect of economic globalization featuring win-win cooperation.

The international situation is stable on the whole. And the world faces both new opportunities and many challenges for peace and development. China, as a responsible major country, will be firmly committed to the path of peaceful development, make greater contribution to expanding the common interests of mankind, and play a constructive role in advancing the lofty cause of world peace and development.

China will be steadfast in its pursuit of modernization. We look forward to closer cooperation with other countries so as to move the world economy out of the dark shadows of the international financial crisis as soon as we can and bring it onto a broad and bright path of strong, sustainable and balanced growth. The World Economic Forum Annual Meeting is held in winter. What it heralds, though, is spring, which will not be far behind.",Premier,Xi Jinping,https://www.fmprc.gov.cn/mfa_eng/wjdt_665385/zyjh_665391/t1121574.shtml,,DEVELOPMENT
USA,25-10-2014,Barack Obama,"
Weekly Address: Focused on the Fight Against Ebola"," Hi everybody, this week, we remained focused on our fight against Ebola.  In Dallas, dozens of family, friends and others who had been in close contact with the first patient, Mr. Duncan, were declared free of Ebola—a reminder that this disease is actually very hard to catch.  Across Dallas, others being monitored—including health care workers who were most at risk—were also declared Ebola-free.

Two Americans—patients in Georgia and Nebraska who contracted the disease in West Africa—recovered and were released from the hospital.  The first of the two Dallas nurses who were diagnosed—Nina Pham—was declared Ebola free, and yesterday I was proud to welcome her to the Oval Office and give her a big hug.  The other nurse—Amber Vinson—continues to improve as well.  And in Africa, the countries of Senegal and Nigeria were declared free of Ebola—a reminder that this disease can be contained and defeated.

In New York City, medical personnel moved quickly to isolate and care for the patient there—a doctor who recently returned from West Africa.  The city and state of New York have strong public health systems, and they’ve been preparing for this possibility.  Because of the steps we’ve taken in recent weeks, our CDC experts were already at the hospital, helping staff prepare for this kind of situation.  Before the patient was even diagnosed, we deployed one of our new CDC rapid response teams. And I’ve assured Governor Cuomo and Mayor de Blasio that they’ll have all the federal support they need as they go forward. 

More broadly, this week we continued to step up our efforts across the country.  New CDC guidelines and outreach is helping hospitals improve training and protect their health care workers.  The Defense Department’s new team of doctors, nurses and trainers will respond quickly if called upon to help. 

New travel measures are now directing all travelers from the three affected countries in West Africa into five U.S. airports where we’re conducting additional screening.  Starting this week, these travelers will be required to report their temperatures and any symptoms on a daily basis—for 21 days until we’re confident they don’t have Ebola.  Here at the White House, my new Ebola response coordinator is working to ensure a seamless response across the federal government.  And we have been examining the protocols for protecting our brave health care workers, and, guided by the science, we’ll continue to work with state and local officials to take the necessary steps to ensure the safety and health of the American people.

In closing, I want to leave you with some basic facts.  First, you cannot get Ebola easily.  You can’t get it through casual contact with someone.  Remember, down in Dallas, even Mr. Duncan’s family—who lived with him and helped care for him—even they did not get Ebola.  The only way you can get this disease is by coming into direct contact with the bodily fluids of someone with symptoms.  That’s the science.  Those are the facts.

Sadly, Mr. Duncan did not survive, and we continue to keep his family in our prayers.  At the same time, it’s important to remember that of the seven Americans treated so far for Ebola—the five who contracted it in West Africa, plus the two nurses from Dallas—all seven have survived.  Let me say that again—seven Americans treated; all seven survived.  I’ve had two of them in the Oval Office.  And now we’re focused on making sure the patient in New York receives the best care as well. 

Here’s the bottom line.  Patients can beat this disease.  And we can beat this disease.  But we have to stay vigilant.  We have to work together at every level—federal, state and local.  And we have to keep leading the global response, because the best way to stop this disease, the best way to keep Americans safe, is to stop it at its source—in West Africa.

And we have to be guided by the science—we have to be guided by the facts, not fear.  Yesterday, New Yorkers showed us the way. They did what they do every day—jumping on buses, riding the subway, crowding into elevators, heading into work, gathering in parks.  That spirit—that determination to carry on—is part of what makes New York one of the great cities in the world.  And that’s the spirit all of us can draw upon, as Americans, as we meet this challenge together.",President,Barack Obama,https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/the-press-office/2014/10/25/weekly-address-focused-fight-against-ebola,,INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS
Russia,09-07-2000 00:00,Vladimir Putin,Address to the United Nations Security Council,"Mr. President,

Colleagues,

All of us are participants of a really historic, threshold meeting of the Security Council. Last months of the millennium are running out, and they remind us about responsibility and obligations towards our peoples and the whole world.

The second half of the century and its international constituent, undoubtedly, passed under the UN sign.

The key UN body – the Security Council – has made everything to safeguard the world from a new military catastrophe, and politicians – from a temptation to exploit temporary advantages for the objectives unworthy of mankind.

* * *

Today’s meeting of the Security Council is held at the summit level.

Without an exaggeration one can say that all of us are both, pupils and teachers “at the UN School”. It is our common offspring. That is why the UN successes are our common successes. If the United Nations makes mistakes, then the responsibility for that rests with all of us and moreover – heads of member-states of the Security Council. That is why it is us who must take upon ourselves the burden of the most difficult decisions. It is us who must set the pace and dynamism of the processes of strengthening the system of the international security.

When the Security Council acts in solidarity and jointly – the most complicated problems give in to settlement. All this only increases the authority of the Council. In my opinion, in the new century we could use the summit format of the meetings more often and not only in New York.

* * *

It is before our eyes and with our direct participation that the face of a new epoch is being shaped up. And it doesn’t matter that ideas about it can differ in details. I am sure that in the principle we are united. This epoch must become an epoch of equal security and just peace.

Under no circumstances the new century and new millennium can be a cause for a reconsideration of the norms of behavior tested by time. The principles laid down in the UN Charter have passed more than one test “for durability” and proved its effectiveness.

First of all it is the principle of supreme rule of international law. A civilized world order without strong legal foundation is impossible. If it is absent then the most alluring informal projects have not a chance for a success.

Second — it is our common responsibility for the world stability and a collective approach to the settlement of contradictions and conflicts. The latest period of history lessons vividly demonstrate: approaches and measures ignoring international law are inevitably undermining both regional and global stability.

Only the Security Council has the right to sanction such an extreme measure as the use of force in the situation of crisis. It does so on behalf and in the interests of the whole world community as the Security Council bears special responsibility for it.

While formulating in exact terms the mandate and the rules for conducting peace making operations, in particular on the basis of Chapter 7 of the UN Charter we should not permit introduction of anybody’s self serving interests.

The peace making efforts of the Security Council have permitted these years to extinguish a few big “regional conflagrations” – in Cambodia, Mozambique, Central America. The latest and one of the most interesting examples of such efforts has become the settlement in Tajikistan. The process of national reconciliation supported by the UN has returned Tajikistan to normal life.

I am convinced: abandonment of unilateral approaches will allow to achieve a just solution of the problem of Iraq, to secure peace and stability in the Balkans. The pertinent resolutions of the Security Council already contain the necessary political and legal conditions. They should be implemented bona fide and in the full scope.

* * *

One of the most acute problems of the contemporary world are the incessant conflicts in Africa. The future of the continent in great degree depends on their speedy and effective settlement. If in the 20th century Africa became free from colonialism, than the 21st century should get it rid off poverty and military confrontation.

In order to solve this important problem the UN and its Security Council should most closely coordinate their activities with the peace making efforts of the African nations themselves.

The most important task consists of improvement of the UN anti-crisis potential. In this sense the “Brakhimi report” presented by the Secretary General will be useful. We should jointly develop the “culture of crisis prevention”, work more on forestalling. Of special importance should be unearthing the profound reasons of conflicts, including economic and social ones.

Cooperation of the Security Council with regional organizations in crisis response has become the reality of our times. Russia makes a tangible contribution to those efforts, carrying out peace making activities jointly with other countries of the Commonwealth of Independent States in strict observance of the UN Charter. Russia participates in ten out of fifteen peace making operations conducted under the UN aegis.

In conclusion, from this “high” rostrum, I would like to thank the UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan and his staff for an excellent organization of our work and preparation of this meeting. I hope that implementation of its results will be productive in the same degree.

Thank you for your attention.",President,Vladimir Putin,http://en.kremlin.ru/events/president/transcripts/statements/24227,,INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS
USA,28-05-2021 00:00,Joe Biden,Remarks by President Biden Addressing Service Members and their Families,"THE PRESIDENT:  I’ll let you guys get comfortable.  (Laughs.)

Colonel Ross — Clint, it’s wonderful to see you again.  Thank you.  When our path last crossed, as Jill said, you were serving in the White House.  And I never thought we’d be standing here today doing what we’re doing today. 

And, Chief Master Sergeant Peterson, thank you, and to all members of your team who helped put this visit together today. It — it means a lot to Jill and me. 

When I was Vice President and — as Chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, we tried to visit almost every major military base in the country, and as Vice President, around the world.  And you are — simply stated, you are the backbone of the country.  You’re the backbone of the country. 

And although our son Beau was the Attorney General of the state of Delaware and had spent nine months in Kosovo trying to — as assistant U.S. attorney — trying to set up their criminal justice system.  And I might say, I’ve — I can do this with the military; I’m going to brag about him a little bit — he’s the only foreigner to have a war memorial erected to him in Kosovo, just below Fort [Camp] Bondsteel and a highway — the first highway they built — named after him: the Joseph R. “Beau” Biden Memorial Highway.  And he was a — he was proud as hell — as hell of his work. 

But then he decided that — I kept on — he had contracted a — exposure to a virus in — when he was in Kosovo and in Turkey as a civilian.  And he came back with a problem.  

But he kept going to Walter Reed.  I couldn’t understand why he was — they finally found — it’s called ankylosing spondylitis.  They finally found a cure.  It prevented him from having what they call “bamboo spine.”  But he kept going back.  I couldn’t understand why.  I thought I knew why, but, Gov, he went back because he was trying to get an exemption to be able to join the United States Army.  He was a sitting attorney general, and as all my colleagues — the Governor and Bobby Scott and Congresswoman — they all know is that when you do that — he joined the National Guard.  And his unit deployed, and he wanted to deploy to Iraq with them.

So he literally had to give up his seat.  Temporarily, he could not have any business done — as you National Guard folks know, you can’t do any business with a state if in fact — you’re now federal property.

And so, he gave up the seat and had the courage to appoint a fellow who had been a Republican attorney general as attorney general while he — while he went.  The proudest thing he ever did — proudest thing he ever did. 

And he — he spent a year in Iraq.  And it was — it was one of the great honors of his life to do it.  Won the Bronze Star, the Conspicuous Service Medal, and other awards — like many of you have — but he never, ever talked about it.

I remember we had an event at the White House — I shouldn’t be talking so much about my son, but I’m not going to apologize for it. 

We had an event for Iraqi veterans at the White House and the President, without telling me and Jill, invited Beau to be there with another 75 soldiers and sailors and airmen.  But he wouldn’t wear any of his decorations.  And General Odierno called him — he served under him — and said, “Put them on now.”  Swear to God.  Walking out of the VP Residence, he wouldn’t put them on until then.  That’s the first time I ever saw the Bronze Star on him.

But I’m just telling you that is — he’s like a lot of you.  You do your duty.  You don’t expect anything for it except be a little — have — get a little respect.  It deserves so much more.  You deserve so much more.

And, you know, I’m honored to be joined today by Governor Northam and by two great representatives of the Commonwealth: Congresswoman Luria and Congressman Scott.  And I want to thank — thank you for all that you do to represent these service veterans, because they’re devoted to you; for the family members, the caregivers, survivors who call Virginia home.

I’m especially honored to share the stage with Brittney, and Jerdan, and Nathan, and Margrit Katherine.  I love those barrettes in your hair, man.  I tell you what — and look at her; she looks like she’s 19 years old, sitting there with her — like a little lady with her legs crossed.  (Laughter.) 

Brittney, you’re doing triple duty: as a veteran, a military spouse, and a teacher.  And, kids, thank you for being there for your mom. 

I can remember all those times — and all of you remember, the spouses — when your husband or wife are deployed.  Every morning, you wake up, you say that little extra prayer while you’re drinking your coffee.  You just spend a little more time wondering.

And, you know, you only — you make up 1 percent of the population.  You’re defending 99 percent of the rest of us.  And we owe you.  But you do your job so gracefully.  You hardly ever say anything about what you’re doing. 

But it matters.  It matters to your families — for that time we’re sitting across from an empty chair at the kitchen table and the dining room table; for those birthdays or Christmases or holidays when they’re gone.

You know, there’s a famous English poet who said, “They also serve who only stand and wait.”  “Also serve who only stand and wait.”

I know Major Beene — having been deployed to Afghanistan during the pandemic has only made everything much harder during the pandemic.  I want to thank you so much — your entire family’s service to our country.  You’re all incredible.  You so underestimate how important you are.

And there’s nothing that Jill and I enjoy more than spending time with our troops here and abroad — if you’re stationed here United States or deployed around the world.

I’ve been in and out of Iraq and Afghanistan over 20 — I think it’s 25 times.  And I’ve seen — I wish everyone could see what you do when you’re there.  I wish they could see every day how you saddle up, how you jump in that cockpit.  Just see — no, you’re just — just doing your job. 

Not to mention all of the troops I’ve had the chance to visit in the Middle East and Europe and the Indo-Pacific region.  We’ve traveled all over.  Jill has traveled all over with me and her own visits to servicemembers in Iraq.  I think she’s the only Second Lady ever to go into the middle of a warzone, because she wanted to be there and see you.

I always want you to know — always — that the issues you and your family are facing, we need to know how we can support you better.  I mean it sincerely from the bottom of my heart: support you better. 

There’s reason for that.  I said, we Bidens are proud to have family in the military.  And our son Beau’s service was — was among the achievements, as I said, he was most proud of.

My heart swelled to see him in uniform. 

When I went into Iraq — I was there for five times — when he was in Baghdad.  (Laughs.)  And I remember, the first time I saw him, his name was “Hunter.”  I said, “What in the hell happened?”  He said, “Dad, I didn’t want anybody to do me any special favors because my Vice President is my dad.”  He got permission to put a different nametag on.

I also remember what it was like to listen to him talk about the needs that people had when he got back home.  About all the folks he served with who came back with post-traumatic stress, and he was back being attorney general, having to deal with that.

But here’s the point: You do so much and you ask for so little.  You know, our experience is a fraction of what so many of you and your families have gone through — a family like Brittney and her kids.  You’re the absolute best America has to offer: our heart, our honor, your solid steel spine. 

So my message to all of you is quite simply: Thank you.  Thank you.  Not “thank you for your service” — just thank you for who you are, because it’s contagious.  Thank you for choosing a selfless service to your country.

I know we have mostly soldiers and airmen in attendance today, but there can be a lot of friendly rivalries on a base.  Each branch has its own proud, cherished traditions and culture.  I know how proud Langley is of their premier 5th-generation F-22 Raptor Wing.  Oh, God, I’d love to go up in one of those. 

I asked, “I’m your Commander-in-Chief.  Why the hell can’t I command you let me go up in one?”  But, you know, they won’t let me do that.

And Fort Eustis hosts one of Army’s busiest airfields, which is led by the Air Force, primarily used by the Navy.  (Laughs.)  It’s all about as joint as it can possibly get.

Every day, the more than 20,000 members of the Air Force and Army, along with civilian personnel, come to work with a shared mission.  No matter which branch of our armed forces you proudly represent, you’re part of the greatest fighting force in the history of the world.  That’s not hyperbole.  The greatest fighting force in the history of the world. 

You’re integral to the most powerful nation in the world.  There’s been no Army, Navy, or Air Force ever like you — or Marines. 

Here at Joint Base Langley-Eustis, you enable the success of our mission around the world.  You provide intelligence support and airpower.  You ensure our soldiers and airmen are ready, trained to deploy the COCOMs around the world — including, this year, adhering to COVID-19 safety protocols and quarantines before to ship out in order to minimize the spread of the virus. 

I know that many of you deployed yourselves, probably more than once.  Over the past 20 years, our volunteer force and our military families have made incredible sacrifices for this country. 

Early in my term as Vice President, when I traveled overseas, I’d sometimes meet service men and women who were deployed their fourth, fifth, sixth times.  I remember going into Baghdad, just remember — and those of you who had to fly in, you do those circular deals so we wouldn’t get shot at, we wouldn’t get hit. 

I walked up in the cockpit of a silver bullet that they had me in.  And I asked — I said, “How many…” — there were five people in the cockpit at the time — the loadmaster as well.  I said, “How many is this your first tour?”  Nobody raised their hand.  “How many the second tour?”  Nobody raised their hand.  “Third tour?”  Two raised their hand.  “Fourth tour?”  Two raised their hand.  “Fifth tour?”  One raised their hand.  No other war have you gone in, served, and got back up and go back again and again and again.  Once.  Once. 

Wiping the blood off the seat of an up-armored HMMWV is enough to get you focused.  Then to saddle up next time and go back and back again?  You’re incredible.  You’re incredible. 

The country — they owe you, and they’re — this time, they’re more appreciative.  In my generation, you didn’t come home and get off an airplane in a uniform in an airport coming back from Vietnam.  People will treat you with respect, but they have no idea the sacrifices you make in theater. 

As we bring — as we get close to bringing down the longest war drawdown in American history — our troop presence in Afghanistan — I want to recognize the significance to — of what all of you, the United States Armed Forces, have accomplished in the past 20 years.

Went to Afghanistan with a clear purpose: to get the people who attacked us on 9/11 and to prevent al Qaeda from using Afghanistan as a base from which to attack America in the future.  To achieve that purpose — you achieved that purpose.  Year after year, deployment after deployment, American troops pursued the terrorist threat through some of the most unforgiving terrain on the planet. 

I have now had the pleasure, as they say, of being to every part of Afghanistan, from the FOBs up in the Kunar Valley; down south, looking at all those poppy fields; and all in between.  It’s one godforsaken landscape. 

But you all just showed up and did your job, and it helped make sure there hasn’t been another attack on the homeland from Afghanistan for the last 20 years.  And you never gave up until we delivered justice to Osama bin Laden.

I got criticized after 9/11 for saying, “We’ll follow the son of a bi- — gun to the gates of hell until we get him.”  It’s exactly what you did.  That’s exactly what you did.  And you got him.

And now, as we draw down, we’re also going to focus on the urgent work of rebuilding over-the-horizon capabilities that’ll allow us to take out al Qaeda if they return to Afghanistan — but to focus on the threat that has metastasized. 

The greatest threat and likelihood of attack from al Qaeda or ISIS is not going to be from Afghanistan; it’s going to be from five other regions of the world that have significantly more presence of both al Qaeda and organizational structures, including ISIS.

We’re going to update our security stance and turn our forces to the threats that will dominate our future to ensure the security of the American people for decades to come. 

But we’ll never, ever, ever forget the terrible cost that we paid as a nation.  Many of you likely have lost friends and colleagues in Afghanistan and Iraq.  I know this is personal to you, especially as you head into Memorial Day weekend.  We as a nation will always remember and pay tribute to those we lost. 

After I announced my decision to end the war in Afghanistan, the first thing I did was visit — visit Section 60 of Arlington National Cemetery — just walked through those headstones, seeing all those stones. 

Our son did not die in Iraq, but he came back — went as an incredibly healthy young man and came back with a severe brain tumor because his hooch was just downwind from those burn pits — I don’t know if that’s the reason.  But he came home — it was just a matter of how long he lived. 

I still carry with me — every single solitary day I have my staff, for the last — since the war began — I have my schedule.  In the back of my schedule, it says, “U.S. daily troop update.  U.S. troops died in Iraq and Afghanistan: 6,927” — not “over 6,000.”  Total fallen angels across the board: over 7,000.

Every one of these lives lost is a tragedy, an empty seat at the dinner table, a missing voice at the holidays.  Every one of them left behind a whole community — not just one, a whole community.  We can never repay that debt.  But I promise you this — and to all the Gold Star families across the country: We will never, ever, ever, ever forget. 

Each year, Memorial Day offers us a chance to reflect on the enormity of the sacrifices that generation after generation of Americans has made and the responsibilities that we bear — the citizens bear in return. 

I’ve said many times — it used to get me in trouble 25 years ago, 30 years ago in the Senate — I said, “America has many obligations.  We only have one sacred obligation.  We have obligations to our children, to the elderly, and so many more things, but only one sacred obligation — is to prepare you, when we send you into harm’s way, with everything you need; to care for your families when you’re gone; when you come home, care for you and your families, and the needs that may be a consequence of the war.”

We owe it.  We owe it to you.  We particularly owe it to their memories to affirm the very best of what America stands for — to uphold honor and democratic values that are the foundation and the strength of this nation.

You know, I sometimes get criticized for saying what I deeply believe, having done this for the bulk of my life.  We’re in a — we’re in a battle between democracies and autocracies.  The more complicated the world becomes, the more difficult it is for democracies to come together and reach consensus.  I’ve spent more time with President Xi of China than any world leader has — for 24 hours of private meetings with him with just an interpreter; 17,000 miles traveling with him in China and here. He firmly believes that China, before the year ’30, ’35,  is going to own America because autocracies can make quick decisions. 

But America is unique.  From all nations in the world, we’re the only nation organized based on an idea.  Every other nation you can define by their ethnicity, their geography, their religion, except America.  America is born out of an idea: “We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men [and women] are created equal… endowed by their Creator with certain inalienable Rights, [including] Life, Liberty,” et cetera. 

None of you get your rights from your government; you get your rights merely because you’re a child of God.  The government is there to protect those God-given rights.  No other government has been based on that notion.  No one can defeat us except us. 

It’s an idea that generations of patriots have fought and died for to defend it.  I know that’s a conviction that each and every day you all share.  That’s why you joined up, why you run around danger when duty calls. 

It’s my greatest honor — it should not surprise anybody; it should be anybody’s greatest honor in all of life — to be able to serve as your Commander-in-Chief.  No greater honor.

So, thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you for spending this time with me today.  And thank you for your commitment to our country, because without you, as I said — I’ll be — end where I began: You are the spine of America — the spine. 

And I can’t tell you how much it matters.  I think you underestimate just the consequence of who you are and what you do. 

So, thank you.  May God bless you.  And may God protect our troops.  Thanks.  (Applause.)",President,Joe Biden,https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/speeches-remarks/2021/05/28/remarks-by-president-biden-addressing-service-members-and-their-families/,,OTHERS
China,29-10-2014 00:00,H.E. Wang Yi,"APEC Beijing: China is Ready
(Speech by Foreign Minister Wang Yi at the Lanting Forum)","Members of the Diplomatic Corps,
Dear Friends,

Good afternoon. Welcome to the Lanting Forum. In 12 days, the 22nd APEC Economic Leaders' Meeting will officially open in Beijing. Chinese President Xi Jinping and leaders and representatives of other APEC members will meet in Beijing to discuss the future of APEC and overall development of the Asia-Pacific region. By then, the attention of the world will once again focus on the Asia-Pacific, on China and on Beijing.

This year marks the 25th anniversary of APEC. Twenty-five years ago, 12 economies in the Asia-Pacific jointly announced the inception of Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation. The birth of this new body had generated relatively less attention compared with some of the defining events of the year, the collapse of the Berlin Wall or the end of the Cold War, to be more specific. Yet in the years that followed, APEC has grown from strength to strength and taken on increasing influence. Today, APEC has evolved into one of the world's most premium regional dialogue and cooperation mechanisms that has a significant and far-reaching relevance to the economic landscape of the Asia-Pacific and beyond.

APEC has shaped the new global geo-economic architecture. In the 1980s, East Asia, with its surging economy, emerged as another pillar of the world together with North America and Western Europe. The founding of APEC had connected countries along the rim of the Pacific and brought together economies, emerging and developed alike. It has gradually transformed the ""Asia-Pacific"" from a mere geographic concept to a body of economic cooperation that involves 2.8 billion people and half of global economic aggregate. APEC members add up to account for 40% of the world's population, 57% of total global GDP and 46% of global trade. The Asia-Pacific is now the most dynamic and promising geo-economic region in the world, widely regarded as an engine driving world economic growth.

APEC has opened a new chapter in regional economic cooperation. APEC is a front runner of the various regional economic cooperation mechanisms in the Asia-Pacific. Over the past 25 years, its membership has grown from 12 to 21 and its participation has been elevated from ministers to leaders. It has become the top-level and most representative cooperation mechanism that covers the widest range of areas in the Asia-Pacific, serving as a major platform for discussion on overall regional cooperation. Since the adoption of the Bogor Declaration 20 years ago, the average tariff level in the Asia-Pacific has dropped by 12 percentage points, total regional trade volume increased by 7 times and every year nearly 200 practical cooperation projects are conducted in 30 different areas. All this has played a critical role in advancing regional economic cooperation. In the 25 years since the founding of APEC, quite a number of regional cooperation mechanisms have emerged and flourished, including ASEAN Plus One and ASEAN Plus Three. Together with APEC, they have formed a network sustaining robust regional cooperation in the Asia-Pacific.

APEC has opened a new chapter in China's relations with the Asia-Pacific. China's accession to APEC in 1991 was a milestone both in the opening-up of China and the development of APEC. Since then, China has begun to integrate with the Asia-Pacific at a faster pace. For instance, in 2013, 60% of China's total foreign trade was with other APEC members, 83% of its utilized foreign investment was from them, and 69% of outbound Chinese investment flowed to them. Meanwhile, the Asia-Pacific is relying more and more on China. According to the IMF, China now contributes over 50% to Asian economic growth, with every one percentage point of China's economic growth driving up the Asian economy by 0.3 percentage point. In fact, China and the Asia-Pacific have become a community of common destiny and shared interests.

Distinguished Guests,

Dear Friends,

The world is undergoing a new round of turmoil and instability. Hotspot issues keep emerging and world economic recovery remains a daunting task. The Asia-Pacific, compared with other regions, has enjoyed overall stability and robust economic growth, serving as an anchor of world stability and a foundation of global prosperity, and China has played its due important role in this process. It is fair to say that the world is full of expectations for the Asia-Pacific and for China in particular.

As an important member of the Asia-Pacific family, China has always taken it its own responsibility to promote Asia-Pacific prosperity and stability and has played a constructive role in regional affairs. The CPC leadership with Comrade Xi Jinping as the General Secretary has, building on the fine traditions as well as the diplomatic guidelines and policies of New China, taken even greater initiatives in creating a favorable external environment for realizing the Chinese dream of the great renewal of the Chinese nation. Greater efforts have been made to ensure that China's development and development of the world are mutually reinforcing, and that China continues to play an even greater role in regional and international affairs as a major responsible country. That represents a main feature of China's diplomacy in the new era and a fundamental direction of its policy toward the Asia-Pacific.

China is committed to building a new Asia-Pacific of peace and stability. China survives and thrives in the Asia-Pacific. It has a strong stake in regional peace and stability. Acting in the interests of peace and stability of the Asia-Pacific, China has proposed the building of a new model of major-country relations with the United States in order to explore a way of engagement between different types of major countries that features not conflict or confrontation but mutual respect and win-win cooperation. China advocates common, comprehensive, cooperative and sustainable security for Asia, and hopes to foster an open and stable security cooperation architecture that suits the need of this region and is generally acceptable. China pursues multilateralism, practices international rule of law and works to facilitate peaceful resolution of hotspot issues. It is firmly committed to the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula and the maintenance of peace and stability of the peninsula, and it supports the peace and reconstruction process in Afghanistan. China stands ready to properly handle disputes over territory and maritime rights and interests that are left over from history through peaceful consultations on the basis of respecting historical facts and in accordance with international law and norms governing international relations.

China is committed to building a new Asia-Pacific of cooperation and prosperity. China's development benefits from a prosperous and stable Asia-Pacific and China is ready to work with countries in the region so that China's development will bring more benefits to others. To this end, China is deepening mutually beneficial cooperation with other countries in the region to build a more closely-knit network of common interests. China pursues domestic development and opening-up at the same time, and aligns its own interests with the shared interests of Asia-Pacific members. China wants to convert the opportunities of the region into those for China, and vice versa. Over the years, China has acted as the most important participant and active contributor in such regional mechanisms as ASEAN Plus China, ASEAN Plus Three and the East Asia Summit. China has identified the Asia-Pacific as a priority area in its ""Go Global"" strategy and encourages Chinese companies to increase investments in other Asia-Pacific countries. China has also conducted cooperation on disaster prevention and relief with other countries in the region and worked with them to confront all forms of emergencies such as earthquakes, tsunamis and major outbreak of epidemics.

China is committed to building a new Asia-Pacific of openness and inclusiveness. The Third Plenum of the 18th CPC Central Committee called for efforts to build a new open economic system, expand converging interests with other countries and regions, and accelerate the implementation of the FTA strategy with neighboring countries as the basis. We hope that the various regional and sub-regional cooperation mechanisms in the region will complement and reinforce each other. We support ASEAN centrality in regional cooperation and welcome a constructive role of non-regional countries in this region. Since last year, President Xi Jinping has put forth a series of major cooperation initiatives on behalf of China, including the Silk Road Economic Belt and the 21st Century Maritime Silk Road, as well as the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank. The primary cooperation partners of these initiatives are Asia-Pacific countries, and they are also the ones that will benefit the most. These initiatives are completely open and inclusive. They are meant to complement, not compete with APEC and other existing cooperation mechanisms. They will further improve the regional cooperation network in the Asia-Pacific and inject fresh impetus to enduring prosperity and development of the region.

Distinguished Guests,

Dear Friends,

China hosted the ninth APEC Economic Leaders' Meeting in 2001. Now, 13 years later, APEC has come to China once again. This is a mission entrusted by the countries and regions in the Asia-Pacific, which also shows their trust in China. All APEC members look to this year's event for consensus and real breakthroughs in regional integration. They look to the Asia-Pacific region for maintaining prosperity and development and driving world economic recovery and growth. And they look to China, the second largest economy in the world, for leveraging its role as APEC host to make fresh contribution to APEC's development and Asia-Pacific's revitalization.

With expectations comes pressure, and more importantly, impetus. Over the past year, in close communication with other APEC members, China has made meticulous plans for the theme, topics and outcomes of the meetings, and aired its views, initiated its proposals and contributed its wisdom. On the basis of democratic, transparent and thorough consultations, we have identified ""Shaping the Future Through Asia-Pacific Partnership"" as the theme and ""Advancing Regional Economic Integration"", ""Promoting Innovative Development, Economic Reform and Growth"" and ""Strengthening Comprehensive Development in Infrastructure and Connectivity"" as the three major topics. Such designs are in line with the trend of economic development in the Asia-Pacific and the wider world. They have met the common demand of all Asia-Pacific economies, and thus gained their welcome and support.

President Xi and the Chinese government attach great importance to the APEC meeting in Beijing. We look forward to having in-depth exchanges and positive interactions with other APEC members during the meeting, thus adding new impetus to the APEC process. With the concerted efforts of all parties, the APEC meeting in Beijing is expected to produce a long list of outcomes and make new breakthroughs in the following three priority areas:

First, APEC members will launch the process of Free Trade Area of the Asia-Pacific (FTAAP) and take a new step forward in achieving regional economic integration. The realization of FTAAP is a long-standing consensus and vision of APEC economic leaders. It can help consolidate the various bilateral and multilateral cooperation mechanisms in the region, and minimize the risks caused by overlapping and fragmented free trade arrangements. Through coordination and cooperation with APEC members, an important consensus will be reached on the launch of the FTAAP process during the meeting in Beijing, thus sending out a clear signal of enhancing regional integration and turning this long-standing vision into concrete actions.

Second, APEC members will identify five pillar areas of cooperation and unleash new impetus for Asia-Pacific economic development. Shifting growth model, restructuring the economy, fostering steady growth and promoting reform are the common tasks of APEC members. The APEC meeting in Beijing will feature in-depth discussions on the five pillars of economic reform, new economy, innovative growth, inclusive support and urbanization in order to deepen cooperation in such frontier areas as Internet economy, urbanization and blue economy. The APEC Accord on Promoting Innovative Development, Economic Reform and Growth, which is expected to be formulated and adopted at the meeting, will have a far-reaching impact on Asia-Pacific's future.

Third, APEC members will focus their efforts on promoting interconnected development and draw up a new blueprint for establishing comprehensive connectivity in the Asia-Pacific. Roads, railways, shipping lanes as well as rules and mechanisms are like the veins and tendons of a human body, while connectivity helps relax the tendons and improve the circulation. With a view to benefiting members across the Pacific, we will work for the formulation of the APEC Blueprint on Connectivity involving hardware, software and people-to-people exchanges in order to provide a strong backing for Asia-Pacific's long-term development.

This year is an important year for APEC's development. Today, 25 years after its founding, APEC is standing at a new historic starting point where it can build on past achievements and make new progress into the future. At this year's APEC meeting, we hope three goals will be achieved. First, to shape the future through Asia-Pacific partnership. Second, to build an open Asia-Pacific economy. And third, to chart the course for APEC development.

Distinguished Guests,

Dear Friends,

The countdown to APEC Beijing has started. Speaking today, I want to let you know that China is ready and Beijing is ready.

China is a country that keeps its words and honors its promises. We always fulfill our responsibilities with all sincerity and do our utmost to live up to the expectations the world places upon us. This was the case for the Olympic Games, the World Expo and the CICA Summit, and so will it be for the APEC meeting.

We will endeavor to host a productive, harmonious and successful APEC meeting in Beijing so that it will leave an indelible imprint in the course of regional cooperation and global economic development. This is a responsibility that China must undertake and a promise that China must keep and deliver on.

To conclude, let us look forward to an incredible opening of APEC Beijing, and wish the event a great success! Thank you.",State Councilor and Foreign Minister of the People's Republic of China,Xi Jinping,https://www.fmprc.gov.cn/mfa_eng/wjdt_665385/zyjh_665391/t1205756.shtml,,DEVELOPMENT
Russia,05-09-2021 00:00,Vladimir Putin,Victory Parade on Red Square,"Citizens of Russia,

Dear veterans,

Comrades soldiers and sailors, sergeants and warrant officers, midshipmen and sergeant majors,

Comrades officers, generals and admirals,

Happy Victory Day! The Victory had a colossal historic significance for the fate of the entire world. It is a holiday that has always been and will remain a sacred day for Russia, for our nation.

It is our holiday by right, for we are blood relatives of those who defeated, crushed, destroyed Nazism. It is ours because we descend from the generation of victors, a generation we are proud of and hold in great honour.

Our dear veterans, we bow before your courage and strong spirit and thank you for this immortal example of unity and love for our Motherland.

You proved that only together it is possible to achieve what seems impossible. You defeated a merciless enemy, defended your home, your children, and your country. You came out an absolute victor in the battle against Nazism and eternalised the memory of May 9, 1945.

We will always remember that it was the Soviet people who demonstrated the ultimate heroism. During the harshest times of war, during the crucial battles that determined the course of the fight against Nazism, our nation was alone on the toilsome, heroic and self-sacrificing road to Victory. Our people fought to the bitter end at every frontline, in the fiercest battles on the ground, at sea and in the air.

People of all ethnicities and faiths fought for every inch of our soil. For the fields on the approaches to Moscow, for the Karelian rocks and Caucasus passages, for Vyazma and Novgorod forests, for the shores of the Baltic Sea and the Dnieper, for the Volga and Don steppes.

The heroism of Soviet troops and the unfaltering spirit of civilians are perpetuated in the glorious titles of Hero Cities, awarded to Moscow and Leningrad, Minsk and Kiev, Stalingrad and Sevastopol, Murmansk and Odessa, Kerch and Tula, Novorossiysk and Smolensk.

The unbreakable bond between frontline fighters and those at the home front ensured that our troops were provided with everything they needed for the Victory, thanks to the efforts of plants in the Volga region and the Urals, Siberia and the Russian Far East, the cities of Kazakhstan and Central Asian republics. We remember those who offered shelter and support to the evacuees who were forced to leave their homes.

Today we gratefully celebrate the memory of an entire generation of great heroes and dedicated workers, and remember our frontline fighters, brave partisans and members of the underground resistance.

We can feel the never-ending pain of the people of Leningrad who suffered through the siege; the concentration camp prisoners, and the countless tragedies of the people who lived in the occupied territories.

We bow to the blessed memory of those whose lives were taken away by that war; the memory of sons, daughters, fathers, mothers, grandfathers, husbands, wives, brothers, sisters, fellow soldiers, family members and friends. We mourn the veterans who have passed.

I ask for a minute of silence.

(A minute of silence begins.)

Friends,

This year, we celebrate 80 years since the beginning of the Great Patriotic War.

June 22, 1941, is one of the most tragic dates in our history. An enemy attacked our country and invaded our land to kill and to spread death and pain, horror and immeasurable suffering.

This enemy not only wanted to overthrow the Soviet political system but also to destroy us as a state, as a nation and wipe our peoples off the face of the earth.

We responded to the invasion by the Nazi hordes with a united, formidable and unstoppable determination to repel that invasion, to do everything in our power for the enemy to be defeated and for the criminals and murderers to receive inevitable and just punishment.

The Soviet people fulfilled their sacred oath, defended their Motherland and liberated Europe from the ‘brown plague’.

The Soviet people issued a historic verdict to Nazism with the power of their weapons on battlefields and with their moral strength and righteousness, the self-sacrificing bravery of soldiers’ mothers and the faithfulness of those who waited, every day, for a message from the frontline from their loved ones. The Soviet people won thanks to the power of kindness and charity that has been inherent to our national character since the earliest times.

This power was manifested in the heroism of doctors and nurses who saved the wounded and fought for every life in the trenches, in the heat of battle, and in hospitals on the frontline and on the home front.

Back then, in 1941there were still four years of the most violent war ahead. That war was a strike at our future, our youth, our youngest generation and, therefore, those who were never to be born.

The war brought upon us so many unbearable ordeals, grief and tears that it is impossible to forget. Those who are plotting new aggressions cannot be forgiven or justified.

It has been almost 100 years since the time when the abominable Nazi beast was gaining insolence and predatory strength in Central Europe. The slogans of racial and ethnic supremacy, anti-Semitism and Russophobia were becoming more and more cynical. Agreements designed to stop the landslide towards a world war were easily broken off.

History demands that we learn from it. Unfortunately, attempts are made to deploy a large part of Nazi ideology and the ideas of those who were obsessed with the delusional theory of their own supremacy.

This ideology is not only supported by radicals and international terrorist groups of all kinds. Today we are witnessing the surviving members of those killing squads and their followers trying to rewrite history and justify the traitors and criminals whose hands are smeared with the blood of hundreds of thousands of civilians.

Our people know too well how this can end. Every single family in our country cherishes the sacred memory of those who fought for our Victory and we will always be proud of their feats.

Russia is consistently defending international law while continuing to protect our national interests and the security of our people.

Our guarantees are the glorious Russian Armed Forces, descendants of the victorious troops, and, of course, our joint efforts for the sake of our country’s development and the wellbeing of Russian families.

Our veterans, their fates and loyalty to the Motherland is the example we follow. It is the summit that we must strive for while reaffirming the significance and the value of the great Victory in our thoughts and deeds, in our present and future endeavours for the sake of our Fatherland.

Glory to the victorious nation!

Happy Victory Day!

USA,30-07-2021 00:00,Joe Biden,Statement of President Joe Biden on the Arrival of the First Flight of Operation Allies Refuge,"Today is an important milestone as we continue to fulfill our promise to the thousands of Afghan nationals who served shoulder-to-shoulder with American troops and diplomats over the last 20 years in Afghanistan. This morning, the first flight of Operation Allies Refuge has arrived in the United States, carrying Afghans who are eligible for Special Immigrant Visas (SIV) and their families. These arrivals are just the first of many as we work quickly to relocate SIV-eligible Afghans out of harm’s way—to the United States, to U.S. facilities abroad, or to third countries—so that they can wait in safety while they finish their visa applications.

These first Afghans are able to come directly to the United States because they have already completed extensive background checks and security screening by the Intelligence Community and the Departments of State and Homeland Security. They will complete the final steps of their visa applications and required medical checks at Fort Lee, in Virginia, before traveling onward to begin their new lives in the United States.

I want to honor all those in the United States who have spoken out on behalf of these brave Afghans, including the proud community of veterans, who have consistently advocated for the Afghans who were by their side in the field in Afghanistan, often serving as translators and interpreters. And I want to thank the diplomats and public servants across our government and around the world who are working tirelessly as part of Operation Allies Refuge.

Although U.S. troops are leaving, we will continue to support Afghanistan through security assistance to Afghan forces, as well as humanitarian and development aid to the Afghan people to help them sustain their achievements of the past 20 years.  We will also continue our diplomatic support for the peace process.  We call for an immediate reduction in violence in Afghanistan, and for all regional actors to encourage the parties to return to negotiations without delay so that the Afghan people can achieve a durable and just political settlement that brings the peace and security they deserve.

Most of all, I want to thank these brave Afghans for standing with the United States, and today, I am proud to say to them: “Welcome home.”",President,Joe Biden,https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/07/30/statement-of-president-joe-biden-on-the-arrival-of-the-first-flight-of-operation-allies-refuge/,,INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS
China,04-05-2015 00:00,H.E. Wang Yi,Promote Industrial Cooperation for Common Development,"Governor Zhang Qingwei,
Excellencies, Members of the Diplomatic Corps,
Distinguished Guests,
Friends,

Welcome to the eleventh Lanting Forum co-hosted by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the People's Government of Hebei Province. The forum is of special significance as it is the first time for the Foreign Ministry to join hands with a provincial government in hosting the Lanting forum.

We hope to achieve three goals with this forum: First, to provide a new platform for provinces and cities such as Hebei to expand exchanges and industrial cooperation with other countries, which reflects the top priority we place on promoting domestic development through diplomatic endeavors. Second, to share China's overall thinking on international industrial cooperation to gain greater understanding and support from the international community. Third, to encourage companies, experts, scholars and people from various sectors to contribute thoughts and wisdom to China's industrial cooperation with the rest of the world.

Friends,

China has all along been an important participant in international industrial cooperation. From the moment China opened its door to the outside world more than three decades ago, we have worked hard to attract production capacity, capital and technology from developed countries and the four Asian Tigers, which greatly facilitated China's economic take-off and the subsequent rapid growth over the years. Given our development level back then, we were at the lower end of the global industrial chain, and our overseas cooperation was mostly about ""bringing in"", rather than ""going out"".

More than thirty years' development has brought tremendous changes to China and elevated it to a whole new level in global economic structure and industrial chain. We have become the world's second largest economy, largest trader in goods, largest holder of foreign exchange reserves, third largest outbound investor and the largest trading partner for nearly 130 nations. As we continue to follow the policy of ""bringing in"", we are in a much stronger position to move our competitive production capacity to the wider world.

The world economy is still in the shadows of the financial crisis. The development gap among regions and between the North and South continues to widen and a new round of profound adjustment in capital, industry and technology is unfolding globally. This means both challenges and opportunities for us to draw on each other's strengths and pursue win-win cooperation. How to seize the opportunity to increase cooperation and strive for development and revitalization of all countries, developing countries in particular, is an important task for us all. China is ready to, in the spirit of win-win cooperation, open up wider, step up industrial cooperation with other countries, and integrate the Chinese economy into the world economy on a larger scale and at a higher level so as to realize common prosperity and progress for China and its partners.

To strengthen industrial cooperation is a sure path for China to accelerate economic transformation. After years of development, China has entered a more mature stage of industrialization with competitive industries and surplus capacity. China is the world's largest producer of over 220 categories of industrial products including steel, cement and automobiles. China produces 38% of the world's machine tools, 41% of ships, and 60% of power generation equipment. These are highly competitive industries and production capacity, not outdated or backward. China is speeding up economic structural adjustment, moving from the world factory to a global production base for sophisticated equipment. The relocation of high quality production capacity overseas is an important step to relieve relatively saturated domestic market and improve quality and efficiency of the Chinese economy. The successful upgrading of the Chinese economy in turn will lend a stronger impetus to world economic growth. This is good news for all countries.

Second, strengthening international industrial cooperation serves the needs of developing countries. Many developing countries in Asia, Africa and Latin America are in the early stages of economic take-off or industrialization and urgently need large amounts of external capital, equipment and technologies. Compared with other countries, China enjoys unique advantages in production capacity, such as advanced and operable equipment, mature and reliable technologies, cost-effectiveness and no strings attached. In addition, China has abundant capital and foreign exchange reserves and will make overseas investment of over US$650 billion in the next five years, which will provide strong financial support for China's industrial go-global effort. Given these factors, many developing countries are looking to have cooperation with China in production capacity and there is considerable space and potential for such cooperation. Let me give you an example. During his visit to Kazakhstan last December, Premier Li Keqiang put forward the proposal for industrial cooperation with Kazakhstan, which fits well with its development strategy and needs. In just several months, the two sides signed cooperation agreements in 28 areas with a total worth of US$23.6 billion. During my visit to five African countries early this year, I have keenly felt for myself the keen desire of African countries to speed up industrialization and achieve diversified development. Therefore, China's initiative for industrial cooperation with Africa has been greeted by active response and warm welcome from the African side. Many countries expressed the hope to be one of the first to benefit from production capacity to be relocated from China.

Third, strengthening international industrial cooperation is an important part of building the new-type international relations featuring win-win cooperation. In contrast to cold-war confrontation and zero-sum game practiced by certain major countries, China has been committed to a win-win strategy of opening-up and pursues win-win cooperation in political, economic, security, cultural and every other aspect of international cooperation. President Xi Jinping advocated the building of new-type international relations featuring win-win cooperation. It is not acceptable to have a few countries get richer while most others suffer from prolonged poverty and backwardness. While pursuing their own development, countries need to actively promote common development with other countries.

International industrial cooperation will help promote the free flow of resources, market integration and extensive sharing of the progress of development. It is an effective way to change the status quo of unbalanced development and unfair resource allocation in the world. As the largest developing country, China has the obligation, commitment and capabilities to provide impetus for the development of other developing countries. It is ready to take new investment opportunities to other developing countries through international industrial cooperation, help them improve infrastructure, obtain technological transfer, create more jobs and upgrade their capacity for independent development. This will help create development opportunities and tangible benefits to other developing countries and their peoples. China is also ready to work with other countries to achieve complementarity of advantages through industrial cooperation, and together make world economic governance more open, balanced, reasonable and inclusive and build a community of shared destiny and common interests among all.

Friends,

In strengthening international industrial cooperation, China will abide by the following principles:

First, a balanced approach to interests and principles. In our cooperation with other developing countries, we will stick to the balanced approach to interests and principles proposed by President Xi Jinping. We will try our best to accommodate their practical difficulties, and give them necessary financing and other support. We also ask Chinese companies to strictly abide by the law in doing business and fulfill their social responsibilities as they invest abroad, never pursue development at the cost of the long-term interests and the environment of their host countries, and never repeat the rapacious colonial way of ""taking without giving"".

Second, win-win cooperation. In our external cooperation, we don't seek to have all benefits to ourself. Rather, we will, on the basis of voluntarism, equality and mutual benefit, take into account the practical needs of the other parties, align the development strategies of both sides and promote industrial cooperation in a pragmatic and effective way. Our aim is to maximize win-win results. As for less developed countries, we will, in light of their conditions and development potential, help them turn their advantages in natural resources and labor into real drivers for independent development.

Third, openness and inclusiveness. China offers fully transparent and open cooperation, and will not engage in vicious competition that excludes third parties. While our current partners in industrial cooperation are mostly developing countries, we also welcome other countries including developed countries to join us in helping developing countries achieve rejuvenation. We are ready to explore industrial cooperation with developed countries on a higher level.

Fourth, market-based operation. We respect the status of companies as the main players and let the market play the decisive role in allocating resources. We will act in strict accordance with market principles, follow accepted international practices and support companies in independent decision-making and sole responsibility for their own profits and losses. On the other hand, the government will fully play its part in guidance, coordination, management and service. We will further improve the institutions and mechanisms, laws and policies, and financial services to encourage and support Chinese companies in going global.

Friends,

International industrial cooperation is a systemic project that needs coordination among all parties at home and abroad. The Foreign Ministry will continue to fulfill its responsibility in developing friendly relations with other countries and foster a sound and amicable external environment for China's cooperation with other countries. At the same time, we will actively support and work with the National Development and Reform Commission, the Ministry of Commerce and other competent departments to further improve the top-level design and strategic planning, so as to provide more effective institutional safeguards, policies and financial services to encourage and support Chinese companies in going global. We will work hard to build connections for competitive and credible companies and offer them sound guidance and services. These include better information support and consular protection to uphold their lawful and legitimate rights and interests abroad.

Hebei Province has long been strong in industries, boasting abundant capacity, advanced technologies and sophisticated managerial expertise in iron and steel, cement, glass, photovoltaic and other areas. As the Belt and Road Initiative advances across the board and as China and Africa jointly implement the ""three networks and industrialization"" program in Africa, the competitive industries in Hebei face a valuable opportunity to go global. I am sure this session of the Lanting Forum offers a good beginning. Hebei will seize the opportunity, fully leverage its advantages, and make continuous progress as a pioneer in external industrial cooperation.

Thank you! ",State Councilor and Foreign Minister of the People's Republic of China,Xi Jinping,https://www.fmprc.gov.cn/mfa_eng/wjdt_665385/zyjh_665391/t1259754.shtml,,DEVELOPMENT
Russia,29-08-2014,Vladimir Putin,President of Russia Vladimir Putin addressed Novorossiya militia,"It is clear the militia has achieved a major success in intercepting Kiev’s military operation, which represents a grave danger to the population of Donbass and which has already led to the loss of many lives among peaceful residents.

As a result of the militia’s actions, a large number of Ukrainian service members who did not participate in the military operation of their own volition but while following orders have been surrounded.

I call on the militia groups to open a humanitarian corridor for Ukrainian service members who have been surrounded, so as to avoid any needless loss of life, giving them the opportunity to leave the combat area unimpeded and reunite with their families, to return them to their mothers, wives and children, and to quickly provide medical assistance to those who were injured in the course of the military operation.

For its part, the Russian side is ready and willing to provide humanitarian aid to the people of Donbass, who have been affected by this humanitarian catastrophe.

I once again call on the Ukrainian authorities to immediately stop military actions, cease fire, sit down at the negotiating table with Donbass representatives and resolve all the accumulated problems exclusively via peaceful means.",President,Vladimir Putin,http://en.kremlin.ru/events/president/transcripts/statements/46506,,INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS

WEEKLY ADDRESS: The Legacy of Nancy Reagan"," Hello, everybody. This past week, we lost an American icon and one of the most influential figures of her time – former First Lady Nancy Reagan.

Born in New York City, and raised mostly in Chicago, Nancy Davis graduated from Smith College in 1943. As an actress, she appeared in 11 films. And off-screen, she starred in a real-life Hollywood romance with the love of her life, Ronald Reagan, whom she married in 1952.

As President, I know just how important it is to have a strong life partner, and President Reagan was as lucky as I am. Nancy Reagan redefined the role of First Lady of the United States. In addition to serving as a trusted advisor to her husband, and an elegant hostess for our nation, she was a passionate advocate for issues that touched the lives of so many. She raised awareness about drug and alcohol abuse. She was a staunch supporter of America’s veterans. And after her own battle with breast cancer and a mastectomy, she spoke in personal terms about the need for women to get mammograms.

The American people were deeply moved by the love Nancy felt for her husband. And we were inspired by how, in their long goodbye, Nancy became a voice on behalf of millions of families experiencing the depleting, aching reality of Alzheimer’s disease. She brought her characteristic intelligence and focus to the twin causes of stem cell research and Alzheimer’s research. And when I signed an order to resume federal stem cell research, I was proud that she was one of the first phone calls I made. Nobody understood better than Nancy Reagan the importance of pursuing treatments that hold the potential and the promise to improve and save lives.

That’s why, last year, my administration announced the Precision Medicine Initiative to advance our ability to tailor health care and treat diseases like cancer and Alzheimer’s by accounting for individual differences in people’s genes, environments, and lifestyles. Last month, we took new actions to foster more collaboration between researchers, doctors, patients, data systems, and beyond to accelerate precision medicine. And more than 40 organizations stepped up with new commitments in this cutting-edge field. We’ve also launched the BRAIN initiative to revolutionize our understanding of how the human brain works.

Thanks to the tireless efforts of people like Nancy Reagan, I’ve never been more optimistic that we are getting closer to the day when every single patient can get the care they need and deserve. I’ve never been more optimistic that we will one day find a cure for devastating diseases like Alzheimer’s. And I can think of no better way to honor our former First Lady’s legacy than by working together, as one nation, toward that goal. Thanks, everybody.",President,Barack Obama,https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/the-press-office/2016/03/12/weekly-address-legacy-nancy-reagan,,OTHERS

Biden, Jr. on the United States Election to the Human Rights Council (HRC)","Today, I am proud that the United States was elected to serve on the UN Human Rights Council for a three year term. I am grateful for the support of nations from around the world for our campaign, and I look forward to the United States once more being a constructive voice that works to help push the Human Rights Council to live up to its mandate and to protect the values we hold dear for all people.

As I said at the UN General Assembly last month, we stand at an inflection point in history. The choices we make in the years ahead will determine the kind of world we leave to future generations. The United States stands ready to work with partners and allies to help lead the world toward a more peaceful, prosperous future, grounded in respect for human dignity. Together, we will stand up for the rights of all, including women and girls, members of LGBTQI+ communities, members of ethnic and religious minorities, those living with disabilities, and members of other marginalized groups. We will promote accountability for governments that abuse human rights. And we will stand in solidarity with, and continue to work tirelessly in support of, the activists, human rights defenders, and peaceful protestors on the front lines of the struggle between freedom and tyranny.

Defending human rights and demonstrating that democracies deliver for their people is a fundamental challenge of our time. It’s at the center of my administration’s foreign policy and it goes to the heart of who we are as a nation—and as a people. And, this December, I look forward to welcoming a diverse group of government, civil society, and private sector actors at a virtual Summit for Democracy to affirm the power of democratic governance as the best and most powerful tool we have to meet the challenges of today and unleash our full human potential.",President,Joe Biden,https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/10/14/statement-by-president-joseph-r-biden-jr-on-the-united-states-election-to-the-human-rights-council-hrc/,,OTHERS
Russia,10-03-2003 00:00,Vladimir Putin,Opening Remarks at a Meeting Dedicated to the Problems of the Agro-Industrial Sector,"Despite all the problems, difficulties and concerns we faced in the beginning, I told the Government to put together a budget for 2004 that would preserve the macro-economic stability in the country, and the basic targets following their first reading seem to be pointing that way.

Remember that this year’s budget was also drawn up with a surplus of 2.5%. And next year we are not going to just collect and spend money to the last rouble. We are again planning a surplus budget, and the extra money obtained will be channeled into a stabilisation fund, or, as they say in other countries, a fund for future generations. The idea is that in the event of an unfavourable situation on world markets we will have a so-called “safety cushion”, or money that will carry us through the rough times.

We observe the same thing in social and political affairs – although our multi-party system is only taking shape. We already have a steadily performing electoral system. We are now approaching State Duma elections and elections in ten regions: St Petersburg, Chechnya, Moscow, the Moscow Region and other parts of the Russian Federation. It is my fond desire that our sense of stability does not falter and does not create the impression that all problems are solved and no other efforts are needed and that somebody else will do something somewhere without us.

I look forward to the high political activity of our people, because that is always an important sign for the authorities – the activity itself and the population’s ranking of preferences during the course of election campaigns and in elections themselves.

I would like to finish by saying that despite a tight and involved political schedule, despite the upcoming national parliamentary and presidential elections in March, we and State Duma deputies will put together not a populist budget, but the country’s main economic law aimed at developing our economy and at reaffirming our course towards Russia’s stable development.

USA,15-10-2021 00:00,Joe Biden,Statement by President Joe Biden on Rising Retail Sales,"We learned this morning that retail sales continued to rise in September after climbing higher than expected in August as well—an increase of 14 percent compared to this time last year, and further evidence of an economy that is returning to normal. This progress is being felt broadly across our economy; department stores, book stores, furniture stores, and a wide array of other retailers all saw a substantial uptick in sales, while restaurants and bars are now up 30 percent over last year and 9 percent above their pre-pandemic levels.

This progress builds on yesterday’s news that the number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment has fallen below 300,000 for the first time since the pandemic began—a drop of more than 60 percent since I took office, and the lowest weekly figure since March 14, 2020. The signs are clear that, despite the global challenges caused by the Delta variant, our economy is on the right track. Vaccination requirements have helped us continue to bring down the number of eligible unvaccinated Americans, from nearly 100 million in July to 66 million today. That is a major reason why COVID-19 cases and unemployment are on the decline—while jobs, wages, and retail sales are all rising.

It is imperative that we take action now to ensure that the historic recovery we are experiencing today does not simply lead to a short-term boost, but that it lays the foundation for long-term prosperity. To carry this momentum forward and build an economy from the bottom up and the middle out, we must listen to the overwhelming majority of the American people and pass both the Bipartisan Infrastructure Act and the Build Back Better Act.",President,Joe Biden,https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/10/15/statement-by-president-joe-biden-on-rising-retail-sales/,,DEVELOPMENT
Russia,22-06-2016,Vladimir Putin,Vladimir Putin addressed the State Duma’s plenary session,"Colleagues,

I wanted to meet with you as the parliament’s sixth convocation comes to the end of its mandate and thank you for your work over these years. I want to thank you and say a few words about the results of your work. Of course, I want to take a look forward too at the tasks the next parliament will have before it.

But first of all, let me turn to the tragic date we are marking today. Seventy-five years ago, Nazi Germany treacherously invaded the Soviet Union and the Great Patriotic War began. By this time, as we know, the Nazis has already enslaved many European countries.

The Soviet people took the brunt of the Nazis’ force, but they met the enemy with tremendous unity and resistance, and withstood the onslaught, fighting literally to the death to protect their homeland. They drove the enemy right back to its lair, inflicted a crushing defeat on the invaders and achieved the Great Victory.

Today, we bow our heads before this heroic generation. Our fathers and grandfathers gave their lives to save Russia and all of humanity from the fascist scourge. We will always remember their sacrifice and courage. We treasure the bright memory of all who gave their lives in that war, and all our veterans who are no longer with us now. I propose that we honour their memory with a minute of silence.

(Minute of silence)

It was the Nazis who unleashed this war. Their ideology of hatred, blind faith in their own exceptional nature and infallibility, and desire for world domination led to the twentieth century’s greatest tragedy.

We know the biggest lesson of that war: it could have been prevented. It could have been stopped if efforts had been made to firmly rein in the Nazis and their accomplices’ wild ambitions in time. But this did not happen. Our country, the Soviet Union, made direct proposals for joint action and collective defence, but these proposals were simply left hanging.

The leaders of a number of Western countries chose instead to pursue a policy of containing the Soviet Union and sought to keep it in a situation of international isolation. But it was Nazism that was the real and terrible global threat. Politicians underestimated its danger, overlooked the threat and did not want to admit that enlightened Europe could give birth to a criminal regime that was growing ever stronger.

    Today, we bow our heads before this heroic generation. Our fathers and grandfathers gave their lives to save Russia and all of humanity from the fascist scourge. We will always remember their sacrifice and courage. 

The international community let its vigilance down and lacked the will and unity to prevent this war and save the lives of millions and millions of people. What other lesson do we need today to throw aside tattered old ideological differences and geopolitical games and unite our forces to fight international terrorism?

This common threat is spreading its danger before our very eyes. We must create a modern collective security system beyond blocs and with all countries on an equal footing. Russia is open to discussions on this most important issue and has repeatedly stated its readiness for dialogue.

For now though, as was the case on the eve of World War II, we see no positive response. On the contrary, NATO is stepping up its aggressive rhetoric and aggressive actions close to our borders. In this situation, we have no choice but to devote particular attention to the tasks we must address in order to increase our country’s defence capability.

I would like to thank the State Duma deputies for their deep and substantive understanding of Russia’s state interests and for knowing how to defend these interests decisively. Of course, I also want to thank you for your consolidated legislative support for the proposals on strengthening our country’s security.

Colleagues, your work and its results deserve a worthy assessment. It is particularly important that the laws you have adopted have played a big part in enabling us to fulfil our social obligations to our citizens, develop our most important economic sectors and improve our country’s political system. I want to stress this point.

    We must create a modern collective security system beyond blocs and with all countries on an equal footing. Russia is open to discussions on this most important issue.

You have accomplished a tremendous amount of work in all these areas. This successful work is the result of the efforts made by all parliamentary parties and their willingness to pursue a constructive dialogue with each other, with the Government, and with the other participants in the legislative initiative.

A truly historic result of this convocation’s work was the legal integration of Crimea and Sevastopol, which followed on your sincere and heartfelt moral support for the peninsula’s people on the eve of the referendum on joining the Russian Federation. You were active in supporting the view shared by the vast majority of Crimea and Sevastopol’s people, sometimes emotionally, and when needed, very professionally.

During this time, all parliamentary parties displayed a degree of unity of which your voters can be deservedly proud. In a very short period of time, you adopted more than 120 laws that smoothed the way for Crimea and Sevastopol’s entry into the Russian Federation. You helped people to get through the transition period’s difficulties, feel at home in Russia and know that their rights are reliably guaranteed and new opportunities have opened before them.

A readiness to consolidate for the sake of the tasks at hand and for Russia’s sake is this convocation’s distinguishing feature. It is very important now that the next parliamentary convocation continues these traditions, including this strict respect for the rules of parliamentary ethics. Continuity in law-making work is of tremendous importance.

This ensures the legislative base’s quality and also the authoritative reputation of the entire Russian jurisdiction. We should most definitely continue the practice of annual reports on the state of our country’s legislation. These reports are drafted by both chambers of the Federal Assembly together with the regional parliaments. This is a very useful practice, I think, very important work.

    A truly historic result of this convocation’s work was the legal integration of Crimea and Sevastopol, which followed on your sincere and heartfelt moral support for the peninsula’s people on the eve of the referendum on joining the Russian Federation.

I want to stress particularly that the legislative branch is an independent branch of power and no opportunist, short term interests or desire to push some decision through as fast as possible should interfere with its work. There should be no hasty or superficial approach when examining and adopting laws. I particularly emphasise this point. The key task for the new convocation in the law-making process will be to ensure a well-planned and systemic legislative process with deep and substantive discussion of draft laws.

Colleagues, I particularly want to mention your great contribution to developing our political system. You have passed a whole swathe of laws that strengthen Russia’s democratic foundations, make the political system more transparent and effective, and set higher standards for political competition.

We now have ten times more political parties than we did five years ago. But we know very well that the political system’s quality cannot be measured by the number of parties, but by their ability to influence the decision-making process regarding the issues of greatest concern to our people.

The parliamentary parties have considerable advantages, and these opportunities are deservedly earned. But during the upcoming election campaign, you will have to pass the test once again before your voters. The executive order setting the date for the State Duma election has already been signed. The election will take place under the mixed-member system on September 18th.

Let me stress that the State Duma will soon get an influx of deputies elected in single-seat districts, and this will bolster considerably the parliament’s representative functions and ties with the regions. It is very important that your work gives our people added guarantees of their social rights. These rights should be guaranteed by laws that regulate education, healthcare, and the housing and utilities sector.

    The legislative branch is an independent branch of power and no opportunist, short term interests or desire to push some decision through as fast as possible should interfere with its work. There should be no hasty or superficial approach when examining and adopting laws.

You have devoted much effort over these last years to precisely these issues, including support for motherhood and childhood. These are complicated issues of course, difficult problems, but their resolution is crucial for our country’s future. All of the different issues are important of course. Security and international affairs are important, but nothing is more important than the economy and the social sector.

We have put together an effective anti-corruption legal base over these last years, toughened requirements to all categories of civil servants, and introduced bans on opening accounts in foreign banks and possessing foreign companies’ assets.

Now we must ensure that all comply strictly with the law no matter what the office they hold. I am sure that we all share a unanimous position on this issue. I note too that the laws you have passed on strategic planning and industrial policy are extremely important, as is the law on priority development areas, for example.

The work on modernising civil law continues, including incentives for business and investment and measures to combat internet piracy. You have also passed the law on parliamentary oversight, which will most certainly raise the prestige and significance of the deputies’ work.

Improving our environmental legislation is an area of much importance today. Protecting nature and the animal and plant world and guaranteeing people’s right to a good natural environment are common tasks for all political parties. I know that during this parliament’s term you have examined draft laws on the preservation and restoration of forests and ensuring forest fire prevention. The new State Duma will have to continue this work just as actively as you have, all the more so as we have declared 2017 the Year of the Environment.

    Now we must ensure that all comply strictly with the law no matter what the office they hold. I am sure that we all share a unanimous position on this issue. 

All parliamentary parties have also shown unity on foreign policy issues. I already mentioned this. Yes, there were some attempts to play up differences between parties, but no one succeeded in splitting your unity and splitting the consolidation in our society and between your voters. At the same time, your contacts with colleagues abroad have become more intensive.

Friends, many political parties have already set dates for holding their congresses to announce candidates and present their campaign programmes. Essentially, the election campaign has begun. Ahead of you is some fierce competition, debates with opponents, and a far from easy time for all who will be taking part in these elections.

I hope that you will do everything possible to ensure that this election is honest, open, and takes place in a spirit of mutual respect. It is also my hope that you will hold a battle not of mudslinging against each other, but of ideas, the implementation of which should strengthen our country and raise our people’s living standards. I appeal to you to do this.

It is very important that all political parties realise their responsibility for preserving social stability and strive not just for the best election results, but for voters’ trust in the election’s outcome. I am sure that stability and trust are key factors and foundations for our country’s successful development.

You are all experienced people and have traversed all the difficulties of election campaigns before. But let me say again nonetheless that the most important players now are not the parties and candidates, but the voters, our country’s people. They are most important. It is they who give you the powers to decide their biggest problems so as to make our country an independent and effectively functioning state in which people can live and work in comfort and safety.

    It is very important that all political parties realise their responsibility for preserving social stability and strive not just for the best election results, but for voters’ trust in the election’s outcome. 

I am sure that you understand well the tasks before our country today. You have already demonstrated this through your work as deputies based on the principles of patriotism and service to people. You have succeeded in developing high standards of political and parliamentary culture and applying them in practice in your everyday work. It will be useful for our country and for the voters if this constructive political style becomes the distinguishing feature of this election campaign too.

You all have much work ahead of you. No matter where you will be working in the future, I wish you professional success and satisfaction, and I want to thank you once again for the very important and responsible work you have done in the Russian parliament.

Thank you very much.

Russia,27-02-2002,Vladimir Putin,Introductory Remarks at a Security Council Meeting on the situation in Chechen Republic," Good afternoon.

Our agenda includes the situation in the Chechen Republic and prospects for resolving it. Today we will be considering military, political and socio-economic problems. But in the first place, of course, we are to discuss security and law and order there.

Today it is possible to state that there is a serious stabilisation of the situation in Chechnya, and mass actions by gunmen have been practically ruled out. Yet as before we are facing the tasks of neutralising the leaders of military formations and suppressing the channels of arms supply and financing, as well as the transfer to the Chechen Republic's territory of foreign mercenaries, including from contiguous territories.

Another substantial question is ensuring timely supplies to the federal forces in Chechnya.

The next complex of questions is socio-economic. There has been progress in this area distinguishing, I would say, the last year as well. Wages, pensions, and other social benefits are being paid regularly. Health care, educational and cultural projects have been developed and implemented. So far, about 60,000 new jobs have been created.

Yet we have fallen behind on a whole series of issues. Restoration and construction remain a substantial problem. With a reasonable organisation of construction several thousand more jobs could have been created, which would have enabled us to make a step forward in dealing with one of the most serious and acute problems — unemployment in Chechnya. Furthermore, the financial flow to Chechnya was unsteady, and the reports on the fulfillment of certain points of the plan have frequently turned out to be far removed from reality.

It is obvious that unemployment, the poor condition of the social sphere and economic stagnation are in no way conducive to establishing order in the republic. This does not help either the federal agencies or the administration or the republic's local government, which is just getting on its feet.

I believe that the main source of problems is the financing mechanisms we have at present. We have held long discussions on organising the financing, but I think there are still many things that need to be discussed further and improved. The money seems to go to Chechnya in a maze-like fashion through a host of agencies and banks. Entirely different entities are responsible for the ultimate use of the funds and the slow pace of work.

The government, first of all the Ministry of Finance and the Federal Treasury, should promptly develop an effective financing mechanism to exclude both abuses and schedule disruptions.

The third set of questions is problems that relate to the possibility of political settlement. Of course, it is directly associated with the process of disarming the military formations. But the process of building up the republic’s local government is also of tremendous significance, as well as ensuring its effective operation and training staff from among the local population. The courts, prosecutor's office, and other law enforcement bodies are already working in the republic now. It is very difficult to accomplish this task. Nevertheless, on the whole, it is being accomplished quite successfully.

But normal life in Chechnya cannot be restored through the efforts of federal authorities alone. In accordance with the Russian Constitution, a constituent member of the Federation must have both local self-government and a system of republican bodies, including law enforcement bodies. It is necessary to establish an appropriate regulatory base for their operation to be effective. We know that the Constitution is being discussed in the republic now, and it is a difficult question, but I think it is absolutely timely. We have created basic conditions to make the transition to dealing with peacetime tasks — I repeat, only basic — and the aspirations of the people of Chechnya for stability, based on constitutional order, are evident. I think that we should pay due attention to this process.

In addition, it is already necessary to look far ahead now. After the Constitution has been approved, we have to restore not only order in the relations with federal structures in the republic, but also democratic election procedures.

A very important matter is the work of the media. Federal television channels, including ORT and RTR, have started broadcasting in sixteen districts of the republic. The work of the republic's radio and reception of central radio stations have been resumed. District and city newspapers are being published. At the same time the information vacuum is still being filled extremely slowly. We have discussed this many times, at all levels and in varied gatherings. This task is being solved very slowly. Information work is also lacking in the zone of counter-terrorist operations.

Finally, one more important job for the republic is migration processes. The return to Chechnya of forced migrants, particularly from the camps in Ingushetia is an essential precondition for the restoration of political and social life. And not only from Ingushetia, but also from abroad, including Georgia. Our agencies have been in contact with the Georgian colleagues. However, at present the Georgian side is not ready to provide the necessary information. I very much hope that the cooperation evolving in this sphere between the Georgian colleagues and our agencies and Emergency Situations Ministry, which must be concerned with this problem, will continue and in the end lead to positive results. In each area of work by the authorities in the Chechen Republic there are still outstanding issues and problems, and today I would ask you not only to identify the sore spots, but also to come up with practical proposals that can rectify the situation.",President,Vladimir Putin,http://en.kremlin.ru/events/president/transcripts/statements/21515,,DEVELOPMENT
USA,01-02-2021 00:00,Joe Biden,"Statement by President Joseph R. Biden, Jr. on the Situation in Burma","The military’s seizure of power in Burma, the detention of Aung San Suu Kyi and other civilian officials, and the declaration of a national state of emergency are a direct assault on the country’s transition to democracy and the rule of law. In a democracy, force should never seek to overrule the will of the people or attempt to erase the outcome of a credible election. For almost a decade, the people of Burma have been steadily working to establish elections, civilian governance, and the peaceful transfer of power. That progress should be respected.

The international community should come together in one voice to press the Burmese military to immediately relinquish the power they have seized, release the activists and officials they have detained, lift all telecommunications restrictions, and refrain from violence against civilians. The United States is taking note of those who stand with the people of Burma in this difficult hour. We will work with our partners throughout the region and the world to support the restoration of democracy and the rule of law, as well as to hold accountable those responsible for overturning Burma’s democratic transition.

The United States removed sanctions on Burma over the past decade based on progress toward democracy. The reversal of that progress will necessitate an immediate review of our sanction laws and authorities, followed by appropriate action.

USA,09-12-2017 00:00,Donald Trump,Remarks by President Trump at the Opening of the Mississippi Civil Rights Museum,"THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you very much.  Thank you.  And I do love Mississippi.  It’s a great place.

And thank you, Governor Bryant, for that kind introduction and for honoring me with this invitation to be with you today.

I also want to recognize Secretary Ben Carson and his wonderful wife, Candy, for joining us.  (Applause.)  Thank you.  Thank you, Ben.  Thank you, Candy.

I especially want to thank you, Justice Reuben Anderson — great man with a great reputation — even outside of the state of Mississippi.  I have to tell you that.  (Applause.)  So, thank you.  Thank you very much.  And you are an inspiration to us all.  Thank you, Judge.

And we’re here today to celebrate the opening of two really extraordinary museums — and I just took a tour — the Mississippi State History Museum and the Mississippi Civil Rights Museum.

To all who helped make these wonderful places possible, we are truly grateful.  We thank you.  We admire you.  It was hard work.  It was long hours.  It’s a lot of money, and I know the Governor helped with that, and that was a great thing you’ve done.  That’s a great legacy, Phil, right there.  Just that in itself.  But it really is a beautiful, beautiful place.  And it’s an honor.

These museums are labors of love — love for Mississippi, love for your nation, love for God-given dignity written into every human soul.

These buildings embody the hope that has lived in the hearts of every American for generations — the hope in a future that is more just and more free.

The Civil Rights Museum records the oppression, cruelty and injustice inflicted on the African-American community, the fight to end slavery, to break down Jim Crow, to end segregation, to gain the right to vote, and to achieve the sacred birthright of equality here.  (Applause.)  And that’s big stuff.  That’s big stuff.  Those are very big phrases.  Very big words.

Here, we memorialize the brave men and women who struggled to sacrifice, and sacrificed so much so that others might live in freedom.

Among those we honor are the Christian pastors who started the Civil Rights movement in their own churches preaching, like Reverend Martin Luther King, Jr. — a man that we have studied and watched, and admired for my entire life — that we’re all made in the image of our Lord.

Students like James Meredith, who were persecuted for standing up for their right to the same education as every other American student.  Young people, like the nine brave students who quietly sat.  And they sat very stoically, but very proudly, at the Jackson Public Library in 1961.  And, by the way, I would add the word “very bravely” — they sat very bravely.

And, finally, martyrs like Sergeant Medgar Wiley Evers — (applause) — whose brother I just met at the plane, and who I liked a lot — I have to — stand up, please.  Come on.  Stand up.  You were so nice.  I appreciate it.  (Applause.)  You were so nice.  Thank you very much.

Medgar joined the U.S. Army in 1943, when he was 17 years old.  He fought in Normandy in the Second World War.  And when he came back home to Mississippi, he kept fighting for the same rights and freedom that he had defended in the war.  Mr. Evers became a civil rights leader in his community.  He helped fellow African Americans register to vote, organize boycotts, and investigated grave injustices against very innocent people.

For his courageous leadership in the Civil Rights movement, Mr. Evers was assassinated by a member of the KKK in the driveway of his own home.

We are deeply privileged to be joined today by his incredible widow — somebody that’s loved throughout large sections of our country — beyond this area.  So I just want to say hello to Myrlie.  Myrlie.  Where is Myrlie?  (Applause.)  How are you, Myrlie?  Thank you so much.  Highly respected.  Thank you.  Thank you, Myrlie.  And his brother, Charles.  Thank you, Charles, again.

For decades, they have carried on Medgar’s real legacy — and a legacy like few people have and few people can even think of.  And I want to thank them for their tremendous service to our nation.

Less than a month before Mr. Evers’s death, he delivered a historic televised address to the people of Jackson on the issue of civil rights.

In that speech, he said the following: The African American “has been here in America since 1619.  This country is his home.  He wants to do his part to help make this city, state, and nation a better place for everyone, regardless of color or race.”

Medgar Evers loved his family, his community, and his country.  And he knew it was long past time for his nation to fulfill its founding promise: to treat every citizen as an equal child of God.  (Applause.)

Four days after he was murdered, Sergeant Evers was laid to rest in Arlington National Cemetery with full military honors.  In Arlington, he lies beside men and women of all races, backgrounds, and walks of life who have served and sacrificed for our country.  Their headstones do not mark the color of their skin, but immortalize the courage of their deeds.

Their memories are carved in stone as American heroes.  That is what Medgar Evers was.  He was a great American hero.  That is what the others honored in this museum were: true American heroes.

Today, we strive to be worthy of their sacrifice.  We pray for inspiration from their example.

We want our country to be a place where every child, from every background, can grow up free from fear, innocent of hatred, and surrounded by love, opportunity, and hope.

Today, we pay solemn tribute to our heroes of the past and dedicate ourselves to building a future of freedom, equality, justice, and peace.

And I want to congratulate your great Governor, and all of the people in this room who were so inspirational to so many others to get out and get this done.  This is an incredible tribute, not only to the state of Mississippi — a state that I love, a state where I’ve had great success — this is a tribute to our nation at the highest level.

This is a great thing you’ve done, and I want to congratulate you, and just say God bless you, and God bless America.

Thank you very much.  Thank you.  Thank you all very much.  (Applause.)",President,Donald Trump,https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefings-statements/remarks-president-trump-opening-mississippi-civil-rights-museum/,,OTHERS
Russia,26-08-2005,Vladimir Putin,Speech at a Plenary Session of the Council of the Heads of States of the Commonwealth of Independent States,"Dear friends, colleagues, and heads of state!

Russia has taken special care in preparing this summit, held during the celebrations commemorating Kazan's 1000th anniversary—the anniversary of one of the most ancient centres of Eurasian civilization. Here, the complex intertwining of both Christian and Muslim destinies, and the mutual enrichment of their cultures and traditions is especially obvious. Kazan's history and today's celebrations convincingly demonstrate that partnership and open dialogue between cultures and peoples is the best way towards both peace and progress.

The Kazan summit's agenda is not just full, it is also strategically crucial. I expect constructive and serious decisions to be made. First of all, this concerns drawing up different plans to reform the Commonwealth. Last year in Astana, we already addressed this question. During the period that followed, we put significant efforts into arriving at a joint resolution.

What are the implications of our deliberations?

First of all, members of the Commonwealth are interested in preserving the association in its entirety and, at the same time, increasing the efficiency of its structures.

Secondly, 15 years have gone by since the founding of the CIS. When determining its relevance today, it is obvious that its present goals clash with obsolete methods and structures. My colleagues have already mentioned this many times, and in different circumstances.

It is one thing to prevent chaos and a snowball effect following the disintegration of the USSR. It is yet another to work effectively towards building close relationships, in accordance with today's tendency towards development and integration.

Third, we have to develop a new model of integration, virtually in the nearest future. The model should provide adequate room for both the shared interests and the national priorities of Commonwealth states.

Russia suggests to form “A High-level Group” modelled on the UN's practice of “The Eminent Persons Group” to solve this conceptual problem. Respected members of our country and people well-acquainted with Commonwealth issues could take part in this decision-making process. Not only bureaucrats, but experts in both legal and economic spheres should represent society's point of view.

Finally, one last, fundamental point. Even though the process of reforming the Commonwealth is a long and difficult one, we must not create obstacles in areas where teamwork has already produced concrete results, where productive cooperation is already taking place. First and foremost, this refers to business partnerships and cultural cooperation.

We are witnesses to the increasing development, already on the new basis, of bilateral relations in the sphere of culture and education.

The initiators of the Forum for creative and academic intellectuals of the CIS met three days ago in Moscow. They have already asked us to support joint cultural and educational projects.

We must regenerate and put new energy into this sphere which is so important for our peoples. We must transpose positive bilateral experience to the multilateral scale. The adoption of the Declaration on cooperation in the fields of culture and education, on the eve of the anniversary of the Great Victory, undoubtedly accelerated this process.

I am convinced that the Agreement on cooperation in the cultural and educational spheres will serve as a tool for new and important projects. In this way, we will favour the development of so-called “human capital” – capital which all our countries consider the major resource for modernization and economic growth.

Shared humanistic values are also an important resource for counteracting extremist ideology, intolerance and terrorism, which threaten stability in the CIS.

During the forthcoming year, it is expedient to put in place a solid frame for cooperation in the cultural and educational spheres. There are many interesting ideas in this regard, such as helping young and talented academics, creating modern research centres, developing national languages, creating sports federations, and holding Olympics.

I will close this address by touching on some questions that we discussed while meeting in small groups.

We agreed that the following CIS summit will take place in Minsk.

Let me inform you that the heads of the delegations, aware of the rigid formal schedule of these festive events, charged me to speak, and unless they have any remarks, precisions, propositions or additional information following my speech, we can begin signing the documents.",President,Vladimir Putin,http://en.kremlin.ru/events/president/transcripts/statements/23136,,INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS
China,07-09-2013 00:00,Xi Jinping,Promote Friendship Between Our People and Work Together to Build a Bright Future,"Your Excellency President Nazarbayev,
President of Nazarbayev University,
Dear Faculty Members and Students,
Ladies and Gentlemen,
Dear Friends,

Good morning. I have come to Kazakhstan, China's great neighbor, on a state visit at the invitation of President Nazarbayev. It is my great pleasure today to come to Nazarbayev University and meet with all of you.

Let me begin by conveying the sincere greetings and best wishes of the Chinese people to the friendly people of Kazakhstan, the faculty members and students of this university and all the friends present today.

As a Kazakh proverb goes, ""The history of a land is the history of its people."" Since independence, Kazakhstan, under the leadership of President Nazarbayev, has seen sustained political stability, robust economic growth, significantly higher living standards and markedly growing international influence.

The city of Astana, where we are today, has grown into a beautiful, modern city in less than two decades. It is a success story written by the people of Kazakhstan on their magic land. Standing here, I could see both the hard work and ingenuity of the Kazakh people and the bright future ahead of them.

Ladies and Gentlemen,

Dear Friends,

Over 2,100 years ago during China's Han Dynasty, a Chinese envoy Zhang Qian was sent to Central Asia twice with a mission of peace and

friendship. His journeys opened the door to friendly contacts between China and Central Asian countries as well as the Silk Road linking east and west, Asia and Europe.

Shaanxi, my home province, is right at the starting point of the ancient Silk Road. Today, as I stand here and look back at that episode of history, I could almost hear the camel bells echoing in the mountains and see the wisp of smoke rising from the desert. It has brought me close to the place I am visiting.

Kazakhstan, sitting on the ancient Silk Road, has made an important contribution to the exchanges between the Eastern and Western civilizations and the interactions and cooperation between various nations and cultures. This land has borne witness to a steady stream of envoys, caravans, travelers, scholars and artisans travelling between the East and the West. The exchanges and mutual learning thus made possible have contributed to the progress of human civilization.

The ancient city of Almaty is also on the ancient Silk Road. In Almaty, there is a Xian Xinghai Boulevard, which got its name from a true story. At the outset of the Great Patriotic War in 1941, Xian, a renowned Chinese composer, arrived in Almaty after much travail. By then, he was worn down by poverty and illness and had no one to turn to. Fortunately, the Kazakh composer Bakhitzhan Baykadamov took care of Xian and provided him with the comfort of a home.

It was in Almaty that Xian composed his famous works Liberation of the Nation, Sacred War and Red All over the River. He also wrote a symphony Amangeldy based on the exploits of the Kazakh national hero. These pieces served as a rallying call to fight Fascists and proved immensely popular with the local people.

Throughout the millennia, the people of various countries along the ancient Silk Road have jointly written a chapter of friendship that has been passed on to this very day. The over 2,000-year history of exchanges demonstrates that on the basis of solidarity, mutual trust, equality, inclusiveness, mutual learning and win-win cooperation, countries of different races, beliefs and cultural backgrounds are fully capable of sharing peace and development. This is the valuable inspiration we have drawn from the ancient Silk Road.

Ladies and Gentlemen,

Dear Friends,

Over the past 20 years and more, the relations between China and Eurasian countries have developed rapidly and the ancicnt Silk Road has gained fresh vitality. In a new way, it is taking the mutually beneficial cooperation between China and Eurasian countries to a new height.

A near neighbor is better than a distant relative. China and Central Asian countries are friendly neighbors connected by common mountains and rivers. China highly values its friendship and cooperation with these countries and takes them as a foreign policy priority.

At present, China's relations with Central Asian countries face a golden opportunity of development. We hope lo work with these countries to strengthen trust, friendship and cooperation, and promote common development and prosperity so as to bring benefits to our people.

- We need to pass on our friendship from generation to generation and always be good neighbors living in harmony. China is committed to the path of peaceful development and the independent foreign policy of peace. We respect the development paths and domestic and foreign policies chosen independently by the people of every country. We will in no circumstances interfere in the internal affairs of Central Asian countries. We do not seek to dominate regional affairs or establish any sphere of influence. We stand ready to enhance communication and coordination with Russia and all Central Asian countries to strive to build a region of harmony,

- We need to firmly support and trust each other and be sincere and good friends. To render each other firm support on major issues concerning core interests such as sovereignty, territorial integrity, security and stability is the essence and an important part of China's strategic partnership with Central Asian countries. We will deepen trust and cooperation with Central Asian countries bilaterally and within the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) to combat the ""three forces"" of terrorism, separatism and extremism as well as drug trafficking and transnational organized crime to create a favorable environment for the economic development and the well-being of the people in this region.

- We need to vigorously enhance practical cooperation and be good partners of win-win cooperation. Both China and Central Asian countries are at a crucial stage of development with unprecedented opportunities and challenges. We have all set medium- to long-term development goals based on our national conditions. Our strategic goals are the same, which is to ensure sustained and stable economic development, build a prosperous and strong nation and achieve national revitalization. Therefore, we need to enhance practical cooperation across the board, turn our good political relations, geographical proximity and economic complementarity into drivers of practical cooperation and sustained growth, and build a community of shared interests and mutual benefit.

- We need to expand regional cooperation with a more open mind and broader vision and achieve new glories together. The world is going through faster economic integration and regional cooperation is booming. The Eurasian region has quite a few regional cooperation organizations. The members and observers of the Eurasian Economic Community (EAEC) and the SCO are from Eurasia, South Asia and West Asia. By intensifying cooperation between the SCO and the EAEC, we will create even more space for development.

Ladies and Gentlemen,

Dear Friends,

To forge closer economic ties, deepen cooperation and expand development space in the Eurasian region, we should take an innovative approach and jointly build an ""economic belt along the Silk Road"". This will be a great undertaking benefitting the people of all countries along the route. To turn this into a reality, we may start with work in individual areas and link them up over time to cover the whole region.

First, we need to step up policy communication. Countries should have full discussions on development strategies and policy response, work out plans and measures for advancing regional cooperation through consultation in the spirit of seeking common ground while reserving differences, and give the policy and legal ""green light"" to regional economic integration.

Second, we need to improve road connectivity. The SCO is working on an agreement on transportation facilitation. If signed and implemented at an early date, it will open up a major transportation route connecting the Pacific and the Baltic Sea. Building on that, we will actively discuss the best way to improve cross-border transportation infrastructure and work toward a transportation network connecting East Asia, West Asia and South Asia to facilitate economic development and travel in the region.

Third, we need to promote unimpeded trade. The proposed ""economic belt along the Silk Road"" is inhabited by close to 3 billion people and represents the biggest market in the world with unparalleled potential. The potential for trade and investment cooperation between the relevant countries is enormous. We should discuss a proper arrangement for trade and investment facilitation, remove trade barriers, reduce trade and investment cost, increase the speed and quality of regional economic flows and achieve win-win progress in the region.

Fourth, we need to enhance monetary circulation. China and Russia have already had sound cooperation on settling trade in local currencies, and have gained gratifying results and rich experience. There is no reason not to share this good practice with others in the region. If our region can realize local currency convertibility and settlement under current and capital accounts, it will significantly lower circulation cost, increase our ability to fend off financial risks and make our region more competitive economically in the world.

Fifth, we need to increase understanding between our people. Amity between the people holds the key to good relations between states. To have productive cooperation in the above-mentioned areas, we need the support of our people. We should encourage more friendly exchanges between our people to enhance mutual understanding and traditional friendship and build strong public support and a solid social foundation for regional cooperation.

Dear Faculty Members and Students,

Young people are the future of a nation. The great Kazakh poet and philosopher Abay Qunanbayev once noted, ""The world is like an ocean and our time is like strong wind. Waves in the front are the cider brother while those behind are the younger brother. Driven by wind, the waves from behind constantly press on those in the front. This has been the case since ancient times."" Seeing so many young glowing faces in the audience, I could not but recall with fond memories my own life in university. It was such an unforgettable time of youth!

The Kazakh people often say, ""Knowledge brings light to the world; without it, confusion will reign."" Indeed, knowledge is power. Young people are in the very prime of life, the best time to acquire knowledge, build character and develop ability. I am sure that the young people to graduate from this university will become future pillars in Kazakhstan's national revitalization.

To facilitate youth exchanges within the SCO framework, China will, in the coming ten years, provide 30,000 government scholarships to SCO member states and invite 10,000 teachers and students from Confucius Institutes in these countries to China for study tours. I hope you will seize these opportunities to come to China for study and exchange.

I also wish to invite 200 faculty members and students from Nazarbayev University to go to China next year and attend summer camp activities.

Ladies and Gentlemen,

Dear Friends,

Young people are the mainstay of friendship between our people. The common interest and ideal they hold for life all bring them together in true friendship. Here let me share with you two touching stories involving Chinese and Kazakh people.

Back in the early 1950s, a Chinese young man working in Xinjiang met a pretty girl called Valentina at a local hospital. They fell in love, got married and had a son. However, due to the political climate and for other reasons, Valentina returned to her home country when their son was only six years old. When the boy grew up, he tried all means to find his mother but to no avail. In 2009, at the age of 61, he finally found out that his mother was living in Almaty. He visited his 80-year-old mother there and took her to China for sightseeing. This happy family reunion, though overdue for half a century, is a strong testament to the friendship between our people.

The other story is about a young Kazakh student whose name is Ruslan. You may know that the RH-negative blood type is called ""panda blood"" in China because it is as scarce as a panda. It is very hard for RH-negative patients to find compatible blood source. Ruslan, who studied at Hainan University in China, happens to be RH-negative. Since 2009, he has been donating blood twice a year, helping to save Chinese patients of his same blood type. When praised by his Chinese friends, he simply said, ""I feel this is what I should do. It is my duty to help others.""

The stories 1 have just told are two episodes from the epic of friendly exchanges between our people, yet they fully demonstrate how close the Chinese and Kazakh people are to each other.

I believe that young people from China and Kazakhstan, including those of you in the audience, are the future envoys of friendship between our two countries. You will contribute your youth and energy to the growth of China-Kazakhstan comprehensive strategic partnership.

Ladies and Gentlemen,

Dear Friends,

China and Kazakhstan are friendly neighbors as close as lips and teeth. Our 1,700-kilometer long common border, two millennia of interactions and extensive common interests not only bind us closely together, but also promise a broad prospect for bilateral ties and mutually beneficial cooperation. Let us join hands to carry on our traditional friendship and build a bright future together.

Thank you.",President,Xi Jinping,https://www.fmprc.gov.cn/mfa_eng/wjdt_665385/zyjh_665391/t1078088.shtml,,INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS
Russia,23-09-2005,Vladimir Putin,Introductory Remarks at Meeting with the Leaders of the Regions in the Southern Federal District,"Good afternoon, dear colleagues!

We have gathered here today in order to discuss the problems facing Russia’s southern regions. I propose that we focus our attention on two problems – problems that we keep returning to constantly – social and economic development in the southern regions, and the security issue.

You know that the federal authorities provide the Southern Federal District with considerable financial support. Indeed, its volume has increased 3.5 times in per capita terms over the last four years. A number of projects aimed at developing the regional and social infrastructure are now underway. But despite this increased federal aid, the gap between the Southern Federal District’s economic indicators and the average national indicators is not getting any less.

The region’s potential clearly does not correspond to its economic and social state of affairs. The district’s natural competitive advantages – and they do exist, as we have discussed many times -– and its great human potential are not being used effectively. The district’s gross regional product is less than half the Russian national average today, and people’s incomes are 1.5 times lower.

The unemployment rate is still high. I do emphasise, however, that we are talking about average indicators here. The different regions that make up the Southern Federal District have different situations. Some, despite the various problems they face, are finding solutions and developing their own resources, actively attracting investment and encouraging business activity. Others, unfortunately, are in a worse situation and many rely exclusively on the federal budget. But, as I said, even the considerable increase in federal support is not enough to ensure sustainable economic growth and resolve the acute social problems the region faces.

In this respect, the biggest priority for the federal and regional authorities is to put in place the conditions for rapid economic growth within the southern regions. Achieving this goal depends to a very great extent on effective, responsible and well-organised cooperation between the federal and regional authorities.

One of the most acute problems facing the district is the rigidity, over-organisation and regulation and excessive administrative intervention in business life in many of its regions. The local markets are in the grip of monopolies and are essentially closed to anyone coming in from outside, and the local authorities are often used as an instrument for unfair competition, and, in other words, become corrupted. We know that this problem is not specific to the southern regions and affects the entire country, but I would like to draw particular attention to the situation in the south.

The practice of granting individual tax breaks and other privileges is widespread, as is unjustified preferential treatment in the allocation of contracts, financial and material resources. As a rule it is the interests of individual civil servants or of clans that are behind these practices. This administrative arbitrariness undermines people’s belief in the possibility of opening their own business and successfully pursuing an honest business. It is enough to say that the number of small and medium-sized enterprises is lower in the Southern Federal District than on average in the rest of the country, and five of the southern regions have seen a noticeable drop in the number of such businesses.

Bureaucratic pressure pushes business life into the shadows, resulting in unpaid taxes, falling revenue for regional budgets and, as a consequence, a lower level of social protection for citizens.

I am absolutely convinced that our work on improving the system of inter-budgetary relations and the division of powers should create incentives for the regional and local authorities – incentives to develop the regional economy and to show more independence and initiative. But at the same time we need to ensure a mechanism for the political and legal responsibility of the regional and local authorities for the final result of their work in economic development, in developing their regions’ taxation base and in resolving social problems.

It would be unfair to blame only the shortcomings in the regional authorities’ work for the current situation. There are, for example, problems with the development and implementation of federal targeted programmes. I agree with many of my colleagues here today on this point. We have discussed it many times. We are lacking a set of clear rules, rules that follow a single logic, for allocating federal investment. This sometimes leads to a chaotic dispersal of resources between different agencies and regions.

It is important that we draw up clear and transparent rules for providing financial aid to the regions and municipalities and that we also establish clear responsibility at all the different levels of authority for the quality of investment projects and, most importantly, for their implementation, for the end result.

I wanted to touch on another important issue that I mentioned at the start of our meeting. It is clear that the economic and social situation in the south of Russia, more than any other part of the country, depends on being able to guarantee public security. The continued activity by terrorist groups and other extremist groups is seriously destabilising the situation in the region with the result that investment attractiveness has fallen and people do not feel properly protected. Organised crime, corruption and the growing drugs trade are all major sources of financial support for terrorists.

I would point out the Southern federal District has the greatest concentration of law enforcement officers not only in Russia but also in Europe and North America: there are 1,200 law enforcement officers for every 100,000 inhabitants. At the same time, there are a lot of questions regarding how effectively the law enforcement agencies are used and what results are gained from budget spending on law enforcement activity. The number of law enforcement personnel is growing all the time, sometimes, I think, to the detriment of the quality and professional training of officers. The lack of clear limits of authority and duplication of work dilute the sense of personal responsibility for the law enforcement services and their heads. Instead of carrying out their primary functions, the law enforcement agencies exercise functions not part of their duties and sometimes carry out unjustified intervention in economic life.

The conclusion is clear: we need to take serious measures to increase the results of the law enforcement agencies’ work, not just throughout the country as a whole, but in the Southern Federal District in particular. I count on cooperation by the federal and regional authorities in this work.

I have no doubt that you will raise these and other issues and problems in your speeches. I would like to hear your concrete proposals on the subjects I have mentioned. ",President,Vladimir Putin,http://en.kremlin.ru/events/president/transcripts/statements/23187,,DEVELOPMENT

And I thank you and the Director of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, Tracy — where is Tracy?  She — there you go, Tracy.  Thank you very much — appreciate it — for joining us in this service.
 
Look, today — today’s special guests — to all of you: It is my honor to congratulate the 21 of you for — who earned the title of — that our democracy, in every — is equal to being President — it’s of the same consequence: citizen — citizen of the United States of America.
 
You have each come to America from different circumstances and different reasons and 16 different nationalities.
 
But like previous generations of immigrants, there is one trait you all share in common: courage.  It takes courage to get up and leave everything you know and go to another place, no matter where it is.  You know, the only homes you’ve ever known, the lives, the loved ones who weren’t able to come — for a new start in the United States of America.
 
If I could hold a second and just point out that I — I’m often asked by — by world leaders that I’m with, particularly autocrats: How can I define America? 
 
I was with Xi Jinping in — on the Tibetan Plateau, and he asked me that when I traveled with him 17,000 miles.  And it was a private meeting — just he and I and a contemporaneous translator.  He said, “Can you define America for me?”  I said, “Yeah, I can, in one word — one word: possibilities.”  Possibilities.  It’s what America is built on.  It’s one of the reasons why we’re viewed sometimes as being somewhat egotistical.  We believe anything is possible in America.  Anything is possible in America.
 
I think about my own family’s journey here — at least two thirds of it came from — got on a coffin ship in the Irish Sea, back in 1849, having no idea whether they’d make it across the Atlantic to the United States, then to the col- — to the United States of America, but certain if they did, they could do better.  And they did.  They did better, and they eventually built a life and raised a family in Scranton, Pennsylvania, over generations.
 
And here I stand on the shoulders and sacrifices of my great-great-grandfather, my great-grandfather, my — and just all that they did because they believed — they believed like you believe: Anything is possible.
 
So I want to thank you all for choosing us, and I mean that sincerely.  Thank you for choosing the United States of America, believing that America is worthy of your aspirations, worthy of your dreams.
 
Making this journey, you have done more than move to a new place.  I’ve often said that America is the only nation in the world founded on an idea.  Every other nation in the world is founded on the basis of either that — geography or ethnicity or religion.  You can define every — almost everyone else based on those characteristics, but you can’t define America.  I defy you to tell me what constitutes an American.  You can’t do it.  We’re an incredibly diverse democracy.
 
But there is one thing that does define us a country: We were founded on an idea that, “We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men [and women] are created equal…endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights…Life, Liberty, [and] the pursuit of Happiness.”  It sounds corny to Americans, as we learn this in grade school and high school.  We’ve never fully lived up to it, but we’ve never, ever, ever walked away from it.  Every generation opens that aperture a little bit wider. 
 
You know, they go back — as I said, since our nation’s founding, the quintessential idea in America has been nurtured and enriched and advanced by the contributions and sacrifices of so many people — almost all of whom were immigrants.  Native Americans were, in fact, the only people who were here — only people who were here.
 
And so, folks, you know, it’s dreams of immigrants like you that built America and continue to inject new energy, new vitality, new — new strength.  We’ve seen that most clearly during this pandemic, with immigrants as frontline workers and as scientists and researchers on the frontlines of finding vaccines. 
 
Another defining moment of our nation in the past year was NASA landing Perseverance Rover on Mars, flying the Ingenuity helicopter above its surface as I talked to them — what is considered a sort of outer-space Wright brothers moment. 
 
I spoke to the team about this historic mission while it was underway, which includes immigrants.  The team was made up of immigrants who told me they grew up looking at the stars — literally, not a joke; I’m not making this up.  That’s what they told me in our conversation.  Looking at the stars and believing only America could take them there.  Well — and we see it each and every single day.
 
Folks, among you are six members of the United States military.  I ask you all to please stand.  Thank you, thank you, thank you for service (inaudible).  (Applause.)  Thank you. 
 
Folks — please sit.  Please sit down.
 
I was telling our new citizens, in the other room before we came in, that one of my most — I don’t know how to say it — fulfilling moments was, as Vice President, when I went over to Saddam Hussein’s god-awful, gaudy palace.  And there were, I think, 167 men and women in uniform standing in that palace.  As my wife who — I think, I’m not sure of this — may be the only First Lady or Second Lady to go into a warzone — an active war zone.  She was with me, and we both stood there as I was able to swear in every one of those military officers as U.S. citizens. 
 
And I thought to myself — I thought to myself, “What incredible justification for all the things that Saddam didn’t believe in.”  And they stood — and there were a number there who had won Silver Stars — not — like you, not citizens when you join — won Silver Stars, Bronze Stars, Conspicuous Service Medals, Purple Hearts.  And I got to swear them in in the palace of a dictator.
 
Also among this incredible group that’s here are healthcare workers and frontline workers who went above and beyond the call in the fight against COVID-19.  They did so in hospitals and clinics, at our National Institute of Health — the NIH — at restaurants and retailers, as educators also in our schools.  I want to thank you all for risking your lives to help others keep their country and our country going. 
 
And joining you today are your families.  And I want you to know and understand that this is your day as well.  I can only imagine the pride you must feel.  Pride in where you come from, in who you are, in the lives you’ve built together as America — in America, and the communities that make you stronger, make us stronger. 
 
All of you represent how immigration has always been essential to America.  We’re constantly renewing ourselves.  Constantly.  When we come out of this pandemic and build an economy, we’re going to build it back better.  If we’re going to do that, we need to fix our immigration system and fully tap the talent and dynamism in our nation. 
 
I’ve kept my commitment and sent an immigration reform bill to the United States Congress.  It includes smart border management and security and a pathway to citizenship for 11 million undocumented people in America.
 
With Vice President Harris’s leadership, we’re getting at the root causes of why people are migrating for our southern border from Guatemala, Honduras, and El Salvador in the first place: the violence; the corruption; the gangs; the political instability; the hungry — the natural — the hunger; the natural disasters.
 
And I’ve made it clear that we can work together on other critical issues as well: a pathway to citizenship for DREAMers — the young people who have only known America as their home; a pathway for immigrants who are here on temporary protective status — TPS — who came from countries beset by manmade and natural-made violence and disaster; and a pathway for farmworkers who are here putting food on our tables but are not citizens.
 
Folks, in the competition for the 21st century, we need an immigration system that both reflects our values and upholds our laws.  We can do both.
 
I’ll close with this: No matter where you come from or the culture that has made us, the language we speak, or the faith we follow, one of the most basic acts of respect is inviting others into your home.
 
You know, as we close out Immigration Heritage Month and start our nation’s Fourth of July weekend, I can think of no better way to honor each occasion than by welcoming all of you into the White House — the People’s House — I might add, designed by an Irishman — (laughter) — for real — in a nation shaped by the immigrant’s heart.
 
I look forward to standing with you as you embrace your new rights and responsibilities as American citizens, and as generations have done before you.
 
So, welcome, my fellow Americans.
 
Now, before we take the Pledge of Allegiance together,
I’d like to invite one guest, Sandra Lindsay, to please come up onstage. (Applause.)
 
Sandra immigrated to Queens, New York, from Jamaica when she was 18 years old.  And over the past — I don’t believe this — 30 years — she doesn’t look 30 years old — (laughter) — she’s pursued her dream of becoming a nurse to allow her to do what she wanted to do most: give back to her new country. 
 
She earned a bachelor’s degree, then a master’s degree, then a doctorate degree, and her citizenship.   And now she’s Director of Nursing for Critical Care at a hospital on Long Island.
 
And during the height of the pandemic, she poured her heart and soul into her work to help patients fight for their lives and to keep her fellow nurses safe. 
 
With a grandson at home — prematurely — she did what she had to do: She kept her distance and kept him safe.  He is safe, but she lost an aunt and an uncle to the virus.
 
But in her pain, she didn’t lose hope.  When the time came, she was the first person in America to get fully vaccinated outside of clinical trials.  She can now hug her grandson.   She’s out there making sure her patients and folks in her community are getting vaccinated so they can get back to their lives and their loved ones.
 
Sandra, if there are any angels in Heaven — as I told you, having spent a lot of time in the ICU — they’re all nurses, male and female.  Doctors let you live; nurses make you want to live.  Make you want to live — for real. 
 
Sandra’s vaccination card and hospital scrubs and the badge that was — she wore will be included in the Smithsonian’s National Museum of American History exhibit on COVID-19.  (Applause.) 
 
And today, she’s receiving the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services’ Outstanding Americans by Choice Recognition, which recognizes the naturalized citizens who have made significant contributions to our country through civic participation, professional achievement, and responsible citizenship.
 
Sandra, thank you for representing the very best of all of us.  Thank you all in this room.  Thank you, again.  This is America.
 
Happy Fourth of July.  May God bless you all.  And may God protect our troops.  Thank you, thank you, thank you.  (Applause.)",President,Joe Biden,https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/speeches-remarks/2021/07/02/remarks-by-president-biden-in-a-naturalization-ceremony-with-essential-workers-and-military-service-members/,,OTHERS
USA,21-01-2020 00:00,Donald Trump,"Remarks by President Trump at the World Economic Forum | Davos, Switzerland","PRESIDENT TRUMP:  Well, thank you very much, Klaus.  And a very special congratulations on your 50th year hosting the Annual Meeting of the World Economic Forum.  A truly amazing achievement.

It’s an honor to address the distinguished members of this organization for the second time as President.  When I spoke at this forum two years ago, I told you that we had launched the great American comeback.  Today, I’m proud to declare that the United States is in the midst of an economic boom the likes of which the world has never seen before.

We’ve regained our stride, we discovered our spirit and reawakened the powerful machinery of American enterprise.  America is thriving, America is flourishing, and yes, America is winning again like never before.

Just last week alone, the United States concluded two extraordinary trade deals: the agreement with China and the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement — the two biggest trade deals ever made.  They just happened to get done in the same week.

These agreements represent a new model of trade for the 21st century — agreements that are fair, reciprocal, and that prioritize the needs of workers and families.  America’s economic turnaround has been nothing short of spectacular.

When I took office three years ago, America’s economy was in a rather dismal state.  Under the previous administration, nearly 200,000 manufacturing jobs had vanished, wages were flat or falling, almost 5 million more Americans had left the labor force than had gotten jobs, and more than 10 million people had been added to the food stamp rolls.

The experts predicted a decade of very, very slow growth — or even maybe negative growth — high unemployment, and a dwindling workforce, and very much a shrinking middle class.  Millions of hardworking, ordinary citizens felt neglected, betrayed, forgotten.  They were rapidly losing faith in the system.

Before my presidency began, the outlook for many nations was bleak.  Top economists warned of a protracted worldwide recession.  The World Bank lowered its projections for global growth to a number that nobody wanted to even think about.  Pessimism had taken root deep in the minds of leading thinkers, business leaders, and policymakers.

Yet despite all of the cynics, I had never been more confident in America’s future.  I knew we were on the verge of a profound economic resurgence, if we did things right — one that would generate a historic wave of investment, wage growth, and job creation.

I knew that if we unleashed the potential of our people, if we cut taxes, slashed regulations — and we did that at a level that’s never been done before in the history of our country, in a short period of time — fixed broken trade deals and fully tapped American energy, that prosperity would come thundering back at a record speed.  And that is exactly what we did, and that is exactly what happened.

Since my election, America has gained over 7 million jobs — a number unthinkable.  I wouldn’t say it, I wouldn’t talk about it, but that was a number that I had in mind.  The projection was 2 million; we did 7 [million] — more than three times the government’s own projections.

The unemployment rate is now less than 3, 4, and 5 percent.  And at 3.5 percent, that’s a number that is the lowest in more than 50 years.  The average unemployment rate for my administration is the lowest for any U.S. President in recorded history.  We started off with reasonably high rate.

For the first time in decades, we are no longer simply concentrating wealth in the hands of a few.  We’re concentrating and creating the most inclusive economy ever to exist.  We are lifting up Americans of every race, color, religion, and creed.

Unemployment rates among African Americans, Hispanic Americans, and Asian Americans have all reached record lows.  African American youth unemployment has reached the lowest it’s ever been in the history of our country.  African American poverty has plummeted to the lowest rate ever recorded.  The unemployment rate for women reached the lowest level since 1953.  And women now comprise a majority of the American workforce; that’s for the first time.

The unemployment rate for veterans has dropped to a record low.  The unemployment rate for disabled Americans has reached an all-time record low.  Workers without a high school diploma have achieved the lowest unemployment rate recorded in U.S. history.  Wages are rising across the board.  And those at the bottom of the income ladder are enjoying the percentage, by far, largest gains.

Workers’ wages are now growing faster than management wages.  Earnings growth for the bottom 10 percent is outpacing the top 10 percent — something that has not happened.  Paychecks for high school graduates are rising faster than for college graduates.

Young Americans just entering the workforce are also sharing in America’s extraordinary prosperity.  Since I took office, more than 2 million millennials have gotten jobs, and their wages have grown by nearly 5 percent annually — a number that was unthinkable.  Nobody would have ever thought it was possible three years ago.  A record number of Americans between the ages of 25 and 34 are now working.

In the eight years before I took office, over 300,000 working-age people left the workforce.  In just three years in my administration, 3.5 million people have joined the workforce.  Ten million people have been lifted off welfare in less than three years.  Celebrating the dignity of work is a fundamental pillar of our agenda.

This is a blue-collar boom.  Since my election, the net worth of the bottom half of wage earners has increased by plus-47 percent — three times faster than the increase for the top 1 percent.  Real median household income is at the highest level ever recorded.

The American Dream is back — bigger, better, and stronger than ever before.  No one is benefitting more than America’s middle class.

We have created 1.2 million manufacturing and construction jobs — a number also unthinkable.  After losing 60,000 factories under the previous two administrations — hard to believe when you hear “60,000 factories” — America has now gained, in a very short period of time, 12,000 new factories under my administration.  And the number is going up rapidly.  We’ll be beating the 60,000 number that we lost, except these will be bigger, newer, and the latest.

Years of economic stagnation have given way to a roaring geyser of opportunity.  U.S. stock markets have soared by more than 50 percent since my election, adding more than $19 trillion to household wealth, and boosting 401(k)s, pensions, and college savings accounts for millions of hardworking families.
And these great numbers are many things, and it’s despite the fact that the Fed has raised rates too fast and lowered them too slowly.  And even now, as the United States is by far the strongest economic power in the world, it’s not even close.  It was going to be close, but a lot of good things happened to us, and some not-so-good things happened to certain other places.

They’re forced to compete, and we compete with nations that are getting negative rates — something very new — meaning, they get paid to borrow money.  Something that I could get used to very quickly.  Love that.  Got to pay back your loan?  Oh, how much am I getting?

Nevertheless, we still have the best numbers that we’ve had in so many different areas.  It’s a conservative approach, and we have a tremendous upside potential, when all of the trade deals and the massive deregulation starts kicking in — which will be during this year, especially toward the end of the year.  Those trade deals are starting to kick in already.  The regulations are kicking in right now.

And I see such tremendous potential for the future.  We have not even started, because the numbers we’re talking about are massive.

The time for skepticism is over.  People are flowing back into our country.  Companies are coming back into our country.  Many of you, who I know, are coming back in with your plants and your factories.  Thank you very much.  America’s newfound prosperity is undeniable, unprecedented, and unmatched anywhere in the world.

America achieved this stunning turnaround not by making minor changes to a handful of policies, but by adopting a whole new approach centered entirely on the wellbeing of the American worker.

Every decision we make — on taxes, trade, regulation, energy, immigration, education, and more — is focused on improving the lives of everyday Americans.  We are determined to create the highest standard of living that anyone can imagine, and right now, that’s what we’re doing for our workers.  The highest in the world.  And we’re determined to ensure that the working and middle class reap the largest gains.

A nation’s highest duty is to its own citizens.  Honoring this truth is the only way to build faith and confidence in the market system.  Only when governments put their own citizens first will people be fully invested in their national futures. In the United States, we are building an economy that works for everyone, restoring the bonds of love and loyalty that unite citizens and powers nations.

Today, I hold up the American model as an example to the world of a working system of free enterprise that will produce the most benefits for the most people in the 21st century and beyond.
A pro-worker, pro-citizen, pro-family agenda demonstrates how a nation can thrive when its communities, its companies, its government, and its people work together for the good of the whole nation.

As part of this new vision, we passed the largest package of tax cuts and reforms in American history.  We doubled the child tax credit, benefitting 40 million American families and lifting 650,000 single mothers and their 1 million children out of poverty — and out of poverty quickly.

We passed the first-ever tax credit for employers who provide paid paternal leave for employees earning $72,000 less annually, and passed paid family leave for government employees as a model for the country.

We made childcare much more affordable and reduced or eliminated childcare waitlists all across the nation.  Our childcare reforms are supporting working parents and ensuring their children have access to high-quality care and education, all of which they very much deserve.

We lowered our business tax from the highest in the developed world down to one that’s not only competitive, but one of the lower taxes.

We created nearly 9,000 Opportunity Zones in distressed communities where capital gains on long-term investments are now taxed at zero, and tremendous wealth is pouring into areas that for a hundred years saw nothing.

The 35 million Americans who live in these areas have already seen their home values rise by more than $22 billion.  My administration has also made historic investments in historically black colleges and universities.  I saved HCBUs.  We saved them.  They were going out, and we saved them.

We’re removing roadblocks to success and rewarding businesses that invest in workers, families, and communities.

We’ve also launched the most ambitious campaign in history to reduce job-killing regulations.  For every new regulation adopted, we are removing eight old regulations, which will save an average of American households about $3,100 per year.  It was going to be, “for every one, we do two,” but we were able to lift that to eight, and we think that’s going to go quite a bit higher.  We still have a way to go.

Today, I urge other nations to follow our example and liberate your citizens from the crushing weight of bureaucracy.  With that, you have to run your own countries the way you want.

We’re also restoring the constitutional rule of law in America, which is essential to our economy, our liberty, and our future.  And that’s why we’ve appointed over 190 federal judges — a record — to interpret the law as written.  One hundred and ninety federal judges — think of that — and two Supreme Court judges.

As a result of our efforts, investment is pouring into our country.  In the first half of 2019, the United States attracted nearly one-quarter of all foreign direct investment in the world — think of that.  Twenty-five percent of all foreign investment all over the world came into the United States, and that number is increasing rapidly.

To every business looking for a place where they are free to invest, build, thrive, innovate, and succeed, there is no better place on Earth than the United States.

As a central part of our commitment to building an inclusive society, we established the National Council for the American Worker.  We want every citizen, regardless of age or background, to have the cutting-edge skills to compete and succeed in tomorrow’s workplace.  This includes critical industries like artificial intelligence, quantum computing, and 5G.

Under Ivanka’s leadership — who is with us today — our Pledge to America’s Workers has become a full-blown national movement with over 400 companies committing to provide new job and training opportunities to already very close to 15 million American students and workers.  Fifteen million.

America is making sweeping changes to place workers and their families at the center of our national agenda.  Perhaps the most transformative change of all is on trade reform, where we’re addressing chronic problems that have been ignored, tolerated, or enabled for decades.  Our leaders did nothing about what happened to us on trade.

Before I was elected, China’s predatory practices were undermining trade for everyone, but no one did anything about it, except allow it to keep getting worse and worse and worse.  Under my leadership, America confronted the problem head on.

Under our new phase one agreement — phase two is starting negotiations very shortly — China has agreed to substantially do things that they would not have done: measures to protect intellectual property; stop forced technology transfers; remove trade barriers in agricultural goods and on agricultural goods, where we were treated so badly; open its financial sector totally — that’s done — and maintain a stable currency, all backed by very, very strong enforcement.

Our relationship with China, right now, has probably never been better.  We went through a very rough patch, but it’s never, ever been better.  My relationship with President Xi is an extraordinary one.  He’s for China; I’m for the U.S.  But other than that, we love each other.

Additionally, China will spend an additional $200 billion over two years on American services, agriculture, and energy, and manufactured goods.  So we’ll be taking in an excess of $200 billion; could be closer to $300 billion when it finishes.  But these achievements would not have been possible without the implementation of tariffs, which we had to use, and we’re using them on others too.  And that is why most of our tariffs on China will remain in place during the phase two negotiations.  For the most part, the tariffs have been left, and we’re being paid billions and billions of dollars a year as a country.

As I mentioned earlier, we ended the NAFTA disaster — one of the worst trade deals ever made; not even close — and replaced it with the incredible new trade deal, the USMCA — that’s Mexico and Canada.

In the nearly 25 years after NAFTA, the United States lost 1 in 4 manufacturing jobs, including nearly 1 in 4 vehicle-manufacturing jobs.  It was an incentive to leave the country.  The NAFTA agreement exemplified the decades-long failures of the international trading system.  The agreement shifted wealth to the hands of a few, promoted massive outsourcing, drove down wages, and shuttered plants and factories by the thousands.  The plants would leave our country, make the product, sell it into our country.  We ended up with no jobs and no taxes; would buy other countries’ product.  That doesn’t happen anymore.

This is the wreckage that I was elected to clean up.  It’s probably the reason I ran for President, more than any other thing, because I couldn’t understand why we were losing all of these jobs to other countries at such a rapid rate.  And it got worse and worse, and I think it’s probably the primary reason that I ran, but there are other reasons also.  And to replace with a new system that puts workers before the special interests.  And the special interests will do just fine, but the workers come first.

Our brand-new USMCA is the result of the broadest coalition ever assembled for a trade agreement.  Manufacturing, agriculture, and labor all strongly endorsed the deal.  And, as you know, it just passed in Congress overwhelmingly.  It shows how to solve the 21st century challenge we all face: protecting intellectual property, expanding digital trade, re-shoring lost jobs, and ensuring rising wages and living standards.

The United States has also concluded a great new trade deal with Japan — approximately $40 billion — and completely renegotiated our deal with South Korea.  We’re also negotiating many other transactions with many other countries.  And we look forward to negotiating a tremendous new deal with the United Kingdom.  They have a wonderful new Prime Minister and wants very much to make a deal, as they say.

To protect our security and our economy, we are also boldly embracing American energy independence.  The United States is now, by far, the number-one producer of oil and natural gas anywhere in the world, by far.  It’s not even close.

While many European countries struggle with crippling energy costs, the American energy revolution is saving American families $2,500 every year in lowering electric bills and numbers that people said couldn’t happen, and also, very importantly, prices at the pump.

We’ve been so successful that the United States no longer needs to import energy from hostile nations.  With an abundance of American natural gas now available, our European allies no longer have to be vulnerable to unfriendly energy suppliers either.  We urge our friends in Europe to use America’s vast supply and achieve true energy security.

With U.S. companies and researchers leading the way, we are on the threshold of virtually unlimited reserves of energy, including from traditional fuels, LNG, clean coal, next-generation nuclear power, and gas hydrate technologies.

At the same time, I’m proud to report the United States has among the cleanest air and drinking water on Earth — and we’re going to keep it that way.  And we just came out with a report that, at this moment, it’s the cleanest it’s been in the last 40 years.  We’re committed to conserving the majesty of God’s creation and the natural beauty of our world.

Today, I’m pleased to announce the United States will join One Trillion Trees Initiative being launched here at the World Economic Forum.  One Trillion Trees.  (Applause.)  And in doing so, we will continue to show strong leadership in restoring, growing, and better managing our trees and our forests.

This is not a time for pessimism; this is a time for optimism.  Fear and doubt is not a good thought process because this is a time for tremendous hope and joy and optimism and action.

But to embrace the possibilities of tomorrow, we must reject the perennial prophets of doom and their predictions of the apocalypse.  They are the heirs of yesterday’s foolish fortune-tellers — and I have them and you have them, and we all have them, and they want to see us do badly, but we don’t let that happen.  They predicted an overpopulation crisis in the 1960s, mass starvation in the ’70s, and an end of oil in the 1990s.  These alarmists always demand the same thing: absolute power to dominate, transform, and control every aspect of our lives.

We will never let radical socialists destroy our economy, wreck our country, or eradicate our liberty.  America will always be the proud, strong, and unyielding bastion of freedom.

In America, we understand what the pessimists refuse to see: that a growing and vibrant market economy focused on the future lifts the human spirit and excites creativity strong enough to overcome any challenge — any challenge by far.

The great scientific breakthroughs of the 20th century — from penicillin, to high-yield wheat, to modern transportation, and breakthrough vaccines — have lifted living standards and saved billions of lives around the world.  And we’re continuing to work on things that you’ll be hearing about in the near future that, even today, sitting here right now, you wouldn’t believe it’s possible that we have found the answers.  You’ll be hearing about it.  But we have found answers to things that people said would not be possible — certainly not in a very short period of time.

But the wonders of the last century will pale in comparison to what today’s young innovators will achieve because they are doing things that nobody thought even feasible to begin.  We continue to embrace technology, not to shun it.  When people are free to innovate, millions will live longer, happier, healthier lives.

For three years now, America has shown the world that the path to a prosperous future begins with putting workers first, choosing growth, and freeing entrepreneurs to bring their dreams to life.

For anyone who doubts what is possible in the future, we need only look at the towering achievements of the past.  Only a few hundred miles from here are some of the great cities of Europe — teeming centers of commerce and culture.  Each of them is full of reminders of what human drive and imagination can achieve.

Centuries ago, at the time of the Renaissance, skilled craftsmen and laborers looked upwards and built the structures that still touch the human heart.  To this day, some of the greatest structures in the world have been built hundreds of years ago.

In Italy, the citizens once started construction on what would be a 140-year project, the Duomo of Florence.  An incredible, incredible place.  While the technology did not yet exist to complete their design, city fathers forged ahead anyway, certain that they would figure it out someday.  These citizens of Florence did not accept limits to their high aspirations and so the Great Dome was finally built.

In France, another century-long project continues to hold such a grip on our hearts and our souls that, even 800 years after its construction, when the Cathedral of Notre Dame was engulfed in flames last year — such a sad sight to watch; unbelievable site, especially for those of us that considered it one of the great, great monuments and representing so many different things — the whole world grieved.

Through[Though] her sanctuary now stands scorched and charred — and a sight that’s hard to believe; when you got used to it, to look at it now, hard to believe.  But we know that Notre Dame will be restored — will be restored magnificently.  The great bells will once again ring out for all to hear, giving glory to God and filling millions with wonder and awe.

The Cathedrals of Europe teach us to pursue big dreams, daring adventures, and unbridled ambitions.  They urge us to consider not only what we build today, but what we will endure long after we are gone.  They testify to the power of ordinary people to realize extraordinary achievements when united by a grand and noble purpose.

So, together, we must go forward with confidence, determination, and vision.  We must not be timid, or meek, or fearful — but instead we must boldly seize the day and embrace the moment.  We have so many great leaders in this room — not only business leaders, but leaders of nations — and some are doing such a fantastic job.  We work together very closely.  We will draw strength from the glories of the past, and we will make greatness our common mission for the future.

Together, we will make our nations stronger, our countries safer, our culture richer, our people freer, and the world more beautiful than ever before.

Above all else, we will forever be loyal to our workers, our citizens, and our families — the men and women who are the backbone of our economies, the heart of our communities, and the soul of our countries.  Let us bring light to their lives one by one and empower them to light up the world.

Thank you very much.  God bless you.  God bless your countries.  And God bless America.  Thank you.  Thank you very much.  (Applause.)",President,Donald Trump,https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefings-statements/remarks-president-trump-world-economic-forum-davos-switzerland/,,DEVELOPMENT

Weekly Address: Playing by the Same Rules"," Hi everybody. Over the past seven years, we haven’t just been recovering from crisis, we’ve been rebuilding our economy on a new foundation for growth – growth that benefits everybody, not just folks at the top. Our businesses have created jobs for 73 straight months – 14.4 million new jobs in all.  We’ve covered another 20 million Americans with health insurance. We’ve helped more Americans afford college, and invested in industries that create good jobs that pay well, like clean energy. And wages are finally rising again. 

But there will always be more work to do. And this week, my Administration took two big steps that will help make sure your hard work is rewarded, and that everybody plays by the same rules.  

First, we’re helping more Americans retire with security and dignity. Right now, if you go to a retirement advisor for investment advice, some of them don’t have to act in your best interest. Instead of telling you the best way to save your hard-earned money, these advisors can get backdoor payments from big companies for steering you toward investments that cost more and earn you less. As a result, when you retire, you might be missing out on tens of thousands of dollars – because your advisor got paid more to give you bad advice. 

If that seems wrong, that’s because it is. That’s why the Department of Labor just finalized a rule to crack down on these kinds of conflicts of interest.  And a lot of Wall Street special interests aren’t very happy about it. But across the country, this new rule will boost working folks’ retirement savings by billions of dollars a year. And it will level the playing field for the many good advisors who do work in their clients’ best interest.  

Second, the Treasury Department took action to crack down on big corporations that change their address overseas after acquiring smaller companies, in order to reduce their tax bill here at home. It’s a loophole called “corporate inversion.”  And it means that American companies can take advantage of America’s technology, America’s infrastructure, America’s workers – but then, when it comes to paying their fair share of taxes, suddenly claim they’re not American companies after all. That’s why, this week, the Treasury Department made it more difficult for companies to exploit this loophole and stick the rest of us with the tab.  

Together, these steps build on the work we’ve already done to make our tax code fairer and consumer protections stronger. Because I believe that rather than double down on policies that allow a few at the top to play by their own rules, we should build an economy where everybody has a fair shot, everybody does their fair share, and everybody plays by the same set of rules.  

That’s what this country is all about. That’s what we’ve been working toward these past seven years.  And that’s what I’m going to keep fighting for as long as I’m your President. 

Thanks everybody. Have a great weekend. ",President,Barack Obama,https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/the-press-office/2016/04/09/weekly-address-playing-same-rules,,DEVELOPMENT

Weekly Address: It’s Time to Help Women and Working Families"," Hi, everybody.  On Friday, I had a discussion with working women in Rhode Island about the economic challenges they face in their own lives -- challenges shared by many of you.

Thanks to the work we’ve all put in, our economy has come a long way these past six years. Over the past 55 months, our businesses have added 10.3 million new jobs. For the first time in six years, the unemployment rate is below 6 percent. And on Thursday, we learned that over the past six months, our economy has grown at its fastest pace since 2003.

But the gains of a growing economy aren’t yet felt by everyone. So we’ve got to harness this momentum, and make the right choices so that everyone who works hard can get ahead.

In recent weeks, I’ve talked about these choices, from raising the minimum wage to creating new jobs in construction and manufacturing. Today, I want to focus on what I discussed with those women -- the choices we need to make to help more women get ahead in today’s economy.

Right now, women make up almost half of our workers. More women are their family’s main breadwinner than ever before. So the simple truth is, when women succeed, America succeeds. And we should be choosing policies that benefit women -- because that benefits all of us.

Women deserve fair pay. Even though it’s 2014, there are women still earning less than men for doing the same work. We don’t have second-class citizens in this country -- we shouldn’t in the workplace, either. So let’s make sure women earn equal pay for equal work, and have a fair shot at success.

Women deserve to be able to take time off to care for a new baby, an ailing parent, or take a sick day for themselves without running into hardship. So let’s make sure all Americans have access to paid family leave.

Pregnant workers deserve to be treated fairly. Even today, women can be fired for taking too many bathroom breaks, or forced on unpaid leave just for being pregnant. That’s wrong -- and we have to choose policies that ensure pregnant workers are treated with dignity and respect.

New parents deserve quality, affordable childcare. There’s nothing like the peace of mind that comes with knowing that your kids are safe while you’re at work. And the benefits that children get out of early enrichment can pay off for a lifetime. But in many states, sending your kid to daycare costs more than sending them to a public university. So let’s start demanding Pre-K for our kids.

And when most low-wage workers are women, but Congress hasn’t passed a minimum wage increase in seven years, it’s long past time that women deserve a raise. About 28 million workers would benefit from an increase in the minimum wage to ten dollars and ten cents an hour. And more than half of those workers are women. The local businesses where these workers spend their money would benefit, too. So let’s do this -- let’s give America a raise.

All of these policies are common sense. All of them are within our reach. We’ve just got to speak up and choose them. Because they’ll build a stronger America for all of us.

Thanks, and have a great weekend.",President,Barack Obama,https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/the-press-office/2014/11/01/weekly-address-it-s-time-help-women-and-working-families,,DEVELOPMENT
USA,06-10-2015,Barack Obama,"
Remarks by the President After Meeting with Agriculture and Business Leaders on the Trans-Pacific Partnership","Well, yesterday we announced a new trade agreement across the Asia Pacific region that reflects American values and gives our working families and American businesses a fair shot, creates a level playing field.  The Trans-Pacific Partnership took five years to negotiate, and I wanted to get the best possible deal done for American workers and American businesses, and that is what we have achieved.  

This agreement makes us more competitive by eliminating about 18,000 taxes, tariffs that are placed on America’s products in these other countries.  Just to give you a couple examples, Japan puts a 38-percent tax on American beef before it ever reaches market.  Malaysia currently puts a 30-percent tax on American auto parts.  Vietnam puts a tax of as much as 70 percent on every car American automakers sell in Vietnam. 

Under this agreement, all those foreign taxes will fall.  Most of them will fall to zero.  So we are knocking down barriers that are currently preventing American businesses from selling in these countries and are preventing American workers from benefitting from those sales to the fastest-growing, most dynamic region in the world.

This agreement opens up new markets for goods that are made in America.  Last year, we exported more than $2 trillion worth of goods and services, which supported about 11.7 million American jobs.  That’s the fifth straight year that we had set an export record.  But when 95 percent of the world’s markets are outside of our borders, we’ve got to do even better than that, particularly at a time when our economy is actually doing better than a lot of other countries and they want to sell stuff here.  We’ve got to make sure that we’re able to sell stuff over there.

With this trade agreement, which spans nearly 40 percent of the global economy, we’re going to be able to sell more products, more services, American agriculture, American manufacturing -- we’re going to be able to get those to markets, and American companies that produce here in the United States are not going to be disadvantaged relative to these markets.

Keep in mind that when there are high barriers in these countries, oftentimes that’s when a lot of American companies feel compelled -- if we want to reach those markets, we’ve got to go produce over there.  If the tariffs are down, if the taxes are down on goods made in America, that means U.S. companies that are investing here are able to sell over there without a disadvantage.  That’s what American leadership looks like in the 21st century.  That’s why this agreement also sets high standards for one of the fastest-growing regions of the world.

This agreement has the strongest labor standards of any trade agreement in history, including setting fair hours, prohibiting child labor, prohibiting forced labor.  It includes the highest environmental standards in history, and prevents overfishing, and makes sure that wildlife trafficking isn’t decimating wildlife that are a world treasure.

And so unlike past agreements, these standards -- high standards around labor and environment -- are actually enforceable.  If countries aren’t abiding by them, then they don’t get the benefits of selling to the United States under the terms of this agreement.  And, under this agreement, we, rather than countries like China, are writing the rules for the global economy.  

So I’ve said repeatedly that I would only sign an agreement and present an agreement to Congress if I could be absolutely certain that it was good for American workers and good for American businesses, good for American farmers and good for American ranchers, and good for American manufacturers.  We have met that standard in this agreement.

So this week marks an important step forward, but there’s going to be a long, healthy process of discussion and consultation and debate before this ever comes to an actual vote.  And we committed properly that we would post this agreement, every crossed t and dotted i, on a website so that everybody is going to be able to look at it.  We are going to be talking not just to members of Congress, but the American public and various constituencies, and governors, and mayors who are represented here about why this is good for their communities.

And so we’re going to have months before this actually comes up for a vote.  People are going to have plenty of time to go over it.  I suspect that there will be some misinformation that is propagated around this, as there usually is in these debates.  But I’m also confident that the case to be made for why this is good for America is sufficiently strong; that ultimately we’re going to get this done, and it will be an enormous achievement for us to be able to make sure that 40 percent of the world’s economy is operating under rules that don’t hurt us, but instead help make sure that American workers and American businesses are getting a fair shot, and that made in America, those products and services can be sold in places where there’s going to be significant demand.

So I want to thank everybody around this table.  This is a diverse constituency.  A lot of different groups are represented here.  We want to thank all of them for their work in getting us to this point, and now helping us get across the finish line.

Thank you very much, everybody.",President,Barack Obama,https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/the-press-office/2015/10/06/remarks-president-after-meeting-agriculture-and-business-leaders-trans,,DEVELOPMENT

Remarks by the President at Seward Harbor","We're going to go out and look at some of these spectacular fjords on one of our Coast Guard cutters.  But before we go out, I just wanted to mention that one of the things we've been trying to highlight during this trip is the changing nature of the Arctic, partly as a consequence of climate change.  There’s a whole series of strategic implications -- economic and national security -- and one of the things that we have to think about is how do we maintain our capabilities when it comes to maritime issues and commerce.  

After World War II, we had seven icebreakers -- four under the Navy, three under the Coast Guard.  Today, in part because we haven't been reinvesting, although we technically have three, operationally we really only have two, and only one heavy icebreaker.  Just to give you a sense of contrast, Russia has about 40, and 11 icebreakers either planned or under construction.  

Now, in light of the changes that are going to be taking place, and the fact that we're going to be seeing more commercial vessels going through the Arctic, even if we're on top of the climate change issues, some of the change is already happening and is going to be inevitable.  It's important that we are prepared so that whether it's for search-and-rescue missions, whether it's for national security reasons, whether it's for commercial reasons, that we have much greater capabilities than we currently have.  

So one of the things that I'm announcing today is a proposal to accelerate the construction of at least one additional heavy icebreaker, and to work with Congress to make sure that we are producing a sufficient fleet to meet our economic, commercial, maritime and national security needs. 

And this is something that's been championed by Republicans like Senator Sullivan here in Alaska, but also Democrats like Maria Cantwell in Washington.  We think that we should be able to generate some bipartisan support, although it's going to be a lot easier to do if we are not continuing to labor under the burdens of sequester that threaten our domestic priorities and investments, but also burden our military and our national security long-term investments.

These icebreakers are examples of something that we need to get online now.  They can’t wait.  And I'm looking forward to trying to work with Congress to make that happen.  

Enjoy the trip, guys.  Stay warm out there.",President,Barack Obama,https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/the-press-office/2015/09/02/remarks-president-seward-harbor,,DEVELOPMENT
Russia,12-10-2013 00:00,Vladimir Putin,Meeting with representatives of Russia’s human rights community,"Good afternoon, colleagues,

My day today is in large part devoted to defenders of the Fatherland. I have just arrived from the Defence Ministry, where I met with military defenders of the Fatherland, and my second meeting is with you, with civilians directly involved in protecting human rights.

Incidentally, I say this seriously, without any irony whatsoever. Of course, in the first case there is purely state representation, and in the second much more civilian representation. Naturally, I believe that these should supplement and complement each other.

Today there is another good reason to meet: 65 years ago, on December 10, 1948, the General Assembly of the United Nations adopted the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Today we celebrate International Human Rights Day, and I would like to sincerely congratulate you all on this occasion.

I would recall that in the near future we will celebrate one more date, the 20th anniversary of Russia’s Constitution. And in this connection I would like to draw attention to the fact that a key part of that document deals with human rights and freedoms, and that they hold a particularly sacred value in the Constitution, in our country’s basic law.

In this regard, I would like to immediately thank those colleagues who spent a long time preparing this law, not only for the fact that they themselves engaged with its text, but also for the way their work had made society more receptive to the norms it contains. First of all I am referring to one of the oldest fighters on this front: our colleague Lyudmila Alekseyeva [chairperson of the regional NGO Moscow Helsinki Group].

There are also those who were directly involved in the text itself. [Human Rights Ombudsman] Vladimir Lukin was directly involved in drawing up the Constitution; in any case, you were part of the relevant Council, and you did a lot in this sense too. Thank you very much to all of you.

This work certainly remains relevant today, and for us it is as important as work to protect citizens’ political rights and freedoms, such as voting rights and their derivatives, as well as social rights, which are equally important. This concerns the right to health, education, labour market protection and so on. All of these are equally important, and I hope that we can continue this work together.

Incidentally, I have already said many times and emphasised that the authorities and the human rights movement have exactly the same tasks. They consist in improving our citizens' lives, making them feel like full-fledged members of society, making them respect society, and ensuring that society and the state treat each of our citizens with respect.

You know that just recently a prominent human rights activist and a fighter against apartheid, Nelson Mandela, passed away. Without a doubt he was an outstanding humanist and one of the most important figures of the 20th and 21st centuries. He did a great deal to introduce humanistic principles not only to Africa, not only to his own country, but throughout the world.

I’m not going to quote his words verbatim, but he formulated one thought very well: to be free, it is not enough to merely throw off one’s chains; you also need to respect the freedom of others. This is a very profound thought and I believe that we all can and should follow these rules to the letter.

We have created relevant instruments in this field. Mr Lukin, as you know, is our Human Rights Ombudsman. But we also have two other institutions: the Commissioner for Children’s Rights and the Commissioner for Entrepreneurs’ Rights. I hope that this, as well as our other activities in this sphere, was what enabled Russia to be elected to the United Nations Human Rights Council.

This election took place just recently, on November 12, 2013. We would like to benefit from your support in this respect, bearing in mind that the work of our delegation to the UN’s Human Rights Council can and should be supported not only by career diplomats, but also by your moral and organisational support.

Colleagues, this is what I wanted to say at the outset. Perhaps we should add that this year – and you know this very well – we have more than tripled our financial support for non-profit organisations. If I remember correctly, a significant portion of these funds – 250 million rubles [$7.5 million] out of 3.2 billion rubles [$97 million] – were allocated specifically to support human rights defenders working in the political sphere.

Moreover, we organised this exactly as you suggested. We discussed this at a meting of the Presidential Council for Civil Society and Human Rights, and decided that these funds will be distributed by the human rights community itself, through one of its organisations. I hope that you are satisfied with how this work has gone.

Let me congratulate you on this occasion.",President,Vladimir Putin,http://en.kremlin.ru/events/president/transcripts/statements/19819,,OTHERS

Weekly Address: Following the President’s Plan for a Strong Middle Class"," Hi, everybody.  This week, I’ve been traveling across the country – from North Carolina to Georgia to here at Hyde Park Academy in my hometown of Chicago – talking with folks about the important task I laid out in my State of the Union Address: reigniting the true engine of America’s economic growth – a rising, thriving middle class.

Every day, we should ask ourselves three questions:  How do we bring good jobs to America?  How do we equip people with the skills those jobs require?  And how do we make sure your hard work leads to a decent living?

I believe all that starts by making America a magnet for new jobs and manufacturing.  After shedding jobs for more than 10 years, our manufacturers have added about 500,000 jobs over the past three.  What we need to do now is simple.  We need to accelerate that trend.  We need to launch manufacturing hubs across the country that will transform hard-hit regions into global centers of high-tech jobs and manufacturing.  We need to make our tax code more competitive, ending tax breaks for companies that ship jobs overseas, and rewarding companies that create jobs here at home.  And we need to invest in the research and technology that will allow us to harness more of our own energy and put more people back to work repairing our crumbling roads and bridges. 

These steps will help our businesses expand and create new jobs.  But we also need to provide every American with the skills and training they need to fill those jobs.  Let’s start in the earliest years by offering high-quality preschool to every child in America, because we know kids in these programs do better throughout their lives.  Let’s redesign our high schools so that our students graduate with skills that employers are looking for right now.  And because taxpayers can’t continue to subsidize the soaring cost of higher education, I’ve called on Congress to take affordability and value into account when determining which colleges receive certain types of federal aid. 

So those are steps we can take today to help bring good jobs to America and equip our people with the skills those jobs require.  And that brings us to the third question – how do we make sure hard work leads to a decent living?

No one in America should work full-time and raise their children in poverty.  So let’s raise the minimum wage so that it’s a wage you can live on.  And it’s time to harness the talents and ingenuity of hardworking immigrants by finally passing comprehensive immigration reform – securing our borders, establishing a responsible path to earned citizenship, and attracting the highly-skilled entrepreneurs and engineers that will help create jobs. 

These steps will help grow our economy and rebuild a rising, thriving middle class.  And we can do it while shrinking our deficits.  We don’t have to choose between the two – we just have to make smart choices. 

Over the last few years, both parties have worked together to reduce the deficit by more than $2.5 trillion – which puts us more than halfway towards the goal of $4 trillion in deficit reduction that economists say we need to stabilize our finances.  Now we need to finish the job. 

But I disagree with Republicans who think we should do that by making even bigger cuts to things like education and job training; Medicare and Social Security benefits.  That would force our senior citizens and working families to bear the burden of deficit reduction while the wealthiest are asked to do nothing more.  That won’t work.  We can’t just cut our way to prosperity. 

Instead, I’ve proposed a balanced approach; one that makes responsible reforms to bring down the cost of health care and saves hundreds of billions of dollars by getting rid of tax loopholes and deductions for the well-off and well-connected.  And we should finally pursue bipartisan, comprehensive tax reform that encourages job creation and helps bring down the deficit.

So we know what we need to do.  All the steps I’ve mentioned are commonsense.  And, together, they will help us grow our economy and strengthen our middle class. 

In the coming weeks and months, our work won’t be easy, and we won’t agree on everything.  But America only moves forward when we do so together – when we accept certain obligations to one another and to future generations.  That’s the American story.  And that is how we will write the next great chapter – together.

Thanks and have a great weekend.",President,Barack Obama,https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/the-press-office/2013/02/16/weekly-address-following-president-s-plan-strong-middle-class,,DEVELOPMENT
Russia,26-11-2002,Vladimir Putin,Speech at a Meeting of the Armed Forces Command,"Good afternoon.

In keeping with tradition, today we are reviewing the results of the year. It has been an eventful year. And it has demonstrated that reappraising the modern threats and taking them into account while modernising the entire state military organisation have been timely.

International terrorism is increasingly becoming a factor of global policy. If we are to combat it effectively, we need not only adjust our doctrinal documents but to optimise the actual structure of the armed forces and to have better interaction between the army and the law enforcement and other security agencies.

An adjusted Concept of National Security must provide the basis for and be a first step in this work. But the country needs its armed forces today, and they must be able to guarantee its security.

Permanent combat readiness units require the most serious attention. The army should be adapted to solve all these tasks within the framework of the Basic Principles of Government Policy in Military Development to 2010. It is one of the fundamental documents.

That approach applies equally to the government’s programme of armaments. Let me stress from the beginning that despite our efforts in fighting terrorism, if our troops do not have what the leading military powers in the world pride themselves on, that would nullify all our efforts in the most important area in the fight against terror.

Regarding the achievements during the current year, I would like to note the following.

First. Next year’s budget for the first time has a declassified item that includes most of the national defence spending. I think you will agree with me that it has been done above all for the benefit of the army itself. The money allocated for salaries, the payment for utility and transportation services must be put under public control.

I hope that this policy of openness will contribute to the modernisation of the armed forces.

Second. You know that the social problems of servicemen were discussed by the Government at its meeting on November 21. This year saw an improvement of the financial and social status of servicemen and veterans of the armed forces. The payment for military rank has more than doubled and the salaries of servicemen have increased by 60–80%.

Of course the increases are not sufficient to warrant claims that the social position of servicemen is excellent. But movement in the right direction is evident. We will continue to take steps in that direction to improve the social status of servicemen and address the problems that have piled up.

Therefore the task of the Defence Ministry and its local bodies is to monitor the way the allocated money is spent. It is within your powers to rule out abuses and make the spending process transparent.

Third. The experiment aimed at changing the principles of recruitment and forming a voluntary army launched in September this year is moving forward, albeit with difficulty. Some results of the pilot project in the Pskov Airborne Division have enabled us to correct our initial approaches.

Fourth. A few words about the personnel policy. I have already twice shared my views on that issue with this audience. My remarks address the issues of selection, placement and enhancement of the responsibility of the top-level and senior officers. And we have said critically that some top-level officers have exceeded their retirement age, and that there is no rotation between the central Staff of the Defence Ministry and the military units on the ground.

The Defence Ministry has drawn the necessary conclusions from that discussion.

I am aware that some serious measures have been taken in recent months to strengthen discipline in the armed forces and eradicate non-regulation relations. In connection with this, I urge you to pay special attention to preventing and stopping crime in the army, especially crime involving the use of arms. I expect that early measures will be taken to strengthen discipline and improve personnel management in the armed forces.

I would also like to mention the decisions taken by the Government on the initiative of the Defence Ministry to improve the work of military schools and their management. That effort must continue.

I have mentioned just the main areas of your work. I believe that during the course of this conference we will be able to discuss some other matters as well. The main thing is that our discussion should help to solve the tasks currently facing the Armed Forces of Russia.

Thank you for your attention.",President,Vladimir Putin,http://en.kremlin.ru/events/president/transcripts/statements/21789,,DEVELOPMENT
Russia,29-11-2018,Vladimir Putin,Meeting of the Security Council,"Good afternoon, colleagues,

Our agenda today includes a set of matters related to ensuring Russia’s energy security. This topic is extremely important and pressing.

For our country, energy – and this, as a matter of fact, includes the electricity industry, as well as oil, gas and coal production – is of particular, strategic importance. Today, unique reserves of all the key energy sources enable us to fully meet our domestic energy needs, while the impressive exports, including to countries of the European Union, the Asia Pacific region, and the CIS, bring to Russia not only tangible revenue but also enable it to remain one of the main guarantors of global energy security.

I would like to point out that recently, we have done a lot to strengthen the domestic energy sector. The Energy Strategy of Russia and a number of large-scale state programmes aimed at developing the fuel and energy sector and enhancing energy efficiency of the entire Russian economy have been approved and come into effect.

Let me also draw your attention to the fact that we should increase the support for Russian energy companies operating abroad, because – and we know this all too well – the opportunities for multilateral and global energy cooperation have often been used lately as tools of containment rather than development. In this connection, we should step up our work at international energy organisations as well as use the potential of international associations with the participation of the Russian Federation to cut short these threats.

As I have already said, attempts to impose unfair competition are having a negative effect on the long-term development of the fuel and energy sector. These include bans on the delivery of modern hydrocarbon exploration and production technology and equipment, as well as direct political pressure put on the countries that import Russian hydrocarbons.

We must assess the current and potential challenges to the Russian energy sector objectively and comprehensively so as to promptly plan countermeasures to these threats.

The updated Energy Security Strategy of Russia is designed to address these challenges. We will discuss it today. After we adopt this doctrine, we will need to adjust our strategic planning documents to its new provisions.

The fuel and energy sector and the national infrastructure as a whole need top-level security as well as the mobilisation and permanent readiness of all the agencies concerned, especially in the autumn and winter period, as we know well.

We must seriously enhance the protection of fuel and energy facilities from terrorist attacks, accidents and other potential threats. This must be done above all through the quality training of personnel, strict compliance with all the security requirements and every technological and technical detail disregarding which can result in negative developments, through improvements in the security systems as well as regular exercises and drills.

And lastly, we must work consistently to rid the energy sector of corruption, all kinds of grey schemes and criminal threats.

I would like representatives from regulatory and law enforcement agencies to share with us their proposals on stepping up work in these areas.

USA,23-09-2019 00:00,Donald Trump,"Remarks by President Trump at the United Nations Event on Religious Freedom | New York, NY","PRESIDENT TRUMP:  That’s very nice.  Thank you very much.  That’s very nice.  And I want to thank Mike.  Today, it’s a true honor to be the first President of the United States to host a meeting at the United Nations on religious freedom.  And an honor it is.  It’s long overdue.  And I was shocked when I was given that statistic that I would be the first.  That’s very sad, in many ways.  And it’s great to be with you.

I want to thank Vice President Pence for the outstanding job he’s doing.  He’s been a fantastic and valuable representative of our country.

Likewise, Secretary Mike Pompeo, Ambassador Kelly Craft, Secretary Ross, Secretary Mnuchin, Ambassador Sam Brownback all for joining us today.  And we have other representatives of our Cabinet and the administration in the room.  We’ve done a lot.

The Johnson Amendment doesn’t get spoken about enough, but I’m very proud to say that we’ve obliterated the Johnson Amendment within our country so that now we can listen to the people that we want to listen to — religious leaders — without recrimination against them.  It’s a very important thing, and I said that at the beginning and I say it now: It’s something I’m very proud of.

We’re also grateful that U.N. Secretary-General António Guterres could be here, along with so many of his friends and my friends — world leaders.  I’ve gotten to know a lot of them, and I would imagine you know all of them.  I would imagine.  If you don’t, you’re not doing your job.  (Laughter.)

And also, I want to thank my daughter Ivanka for being here.  She works so hard on all of the things that are very important to the people in this room.  So, thank you, Ivanka, for being here.  (Applause.)

The United States is founded on the principle that our rights do not come from government; they come from God.  This immortal truth is proclaimed in our Declaration of Independence and enshrined in the First Amendment to our Constitution’s Bill of Rights.  Our Founders understood that no right is more fundamental to a peaceful, prosperous, and virtuous society than the right to follow one’s religious convictions.

Regrettably, the religious freedom enjoyed by American citizens is rare in the world.  Approximately 80 percent of the world’s population live in countries where religious liberty is threatened, restricted, or even banned.  And when I heard that number, I said, “Please go back and check it because it can’t possibly be correct.”  And, sadly, it was.  Eighty percent.

As we speak, Jews, Christians, Muslims, Buddhists, Hindus, Sikhs, Yazidis, and many other people of faith are being jailed, sanctioned, tortured, and even murdered, often at the hands of their own government, simply for expressing their deeply held religious beliefs.  So hard to believe.

Today, with one clear voice, the United States of America calls upon the nations of the world to end religious persecution.  (Applause.)

To stop the crimes against people of faith, release prisoners of conscience, repeal laws restricting freedom of religion and belief, protect the vulnerable, the defenseless, and the oppressed, America stands with believers in every country who ask only for the freedom to live according to the faith that is within their own hearts.

As President, protecting religious freedom is one of my highest priorities and always has been.  Last year, our Secretary of State, Mike Pompeo, hosted the first-ever Ministerial to Advance International Religious Freedom.

In this year’s ministerial, Secretary Pompeo announced plans to create the International Religious Freedom Alliance — an alliance of likeminded nations devoted to confronting religious persecution all around the world.

I’ve appointed a special envoy to monitor and combat anti-Semitism.  We’re standing up for almost 250 million Christians around the world who are persecuted for their faith.  It is estimated that 11 Christians are killed every day for the following — I mean, just think of this: Eleven Christians a day, for following the teachings of Christ.  Who would even think that’s possible in this day and age?  Who would think it’s possible?

With us today is Pastor Andrew Brunson, who was imprisoned in Turkey for a long period of time.  Last year, my administration was thrilled to bring him back home after a very short and respectful negotiation with a very strong man — and a man who has become a friend of mine, fortunately — President Erdoğan of Turkey.

I called the President, and I said, “He’s an innocent man.”  They’ve been trying to get Andrew out for a long time — previous administration.  I don’t think they tried too hard, unfortunately.

But I want to thank President Erdoğan, and I want to thank you, Pastor, for being here with us today.  Where is Andrew?  Is he around someplace?  Thank you, Andrew.  (Applause.)

We did a good job with that negotiation, Andrew.  You got back.  It wasn’t easy.  It wasn’t pretty.  But you got back.  And we’re proud of you.  You have a great family.  And the love — when Andrew came back, the love from so many people, it was — actually, I hadn’t seen anything quite like it.

So, congratulations.  And I understand you’re doing fantastic work with your family.  Thank you very much.  Thank you, Andrew.  (Applause.)

And I also want to thank Franklin Graham because he’s been so instrumental in everything we’re doing.  He’s done such an incredible job in so many different ways, including floods and hurricanes.  And every time I go, I see Franklin there.  He’s always there before me.  I don’t know how he gets there before me.  I’m going to beat him one day.  But he’s always at these places of — really, disaster areas.  He’s right there with an incredible, large staff of volunteers that are just amazing.  Thank you very much.  And, CeCe, thank you very much.  (Applause.)  Thank you very much.  And, Paula White, thank you very much.

In July, I met with survivors of religious persecution at the White House.  And we’re honored that many of them could be here today as well.  Some of these individuals suffered as a result of state-sponsored persecution; others, at the hands of terrorists and criminals.  No matter the case, America will always be a voice for victims of religious persecution everywhere.  No matter where you go, you have a place in the United States of America.  Could I ask those folks to stand up, please?  Please, stand up.  (Applause.)  Thank you.  Thank you very much.

In recent times, the world has also witnessed devastating acts of violence in sacred places of worship.  In 2016, an 85-year-old Catholic priest was viciously killed while celebrating mass in Normandy, France.  In the past year, the United States endured horrifying anti-Semitic attacks against Jewish Americans at synagogues in Pennsylvania and California.  In March, Muslims praying with their families were sadistically murdered in New Zealand.  On Easter Sunday this year, terrorists bombed Christian churches in Sri Lanka, killing hundreds of faithful worshippers.  Who would believe this is even possible?

These evil attacks are a wound on all humanity.  We must all work together to protect communities of every faith.  We’re also urging every nation to increase the prosecution and punishment of crimes against religious communities.  There can be no greater crime than that.  This includes measures to prevent the intentional destruction of religious sites and relics.  Today, the Trump administration will dedicate an additional $25 million to protect religious freedom and religious sites and relics.

We’re also pleased to be joined today by many of the partners from the business community, as we announce a very critical initiative.

The United States is forming a coalition of U.S. businesses for the protection of religious freedom.  This is the first time this has been done.  This initiative will encourage the private sector to protect people of all faiths in the workplace.  And the private sector has brilliant leadership.  And that’s why some of the people in this room are among the most successful men and women on Earth.  They know how things get done and they know how to take care of things.  And they’re with us now for the first time, to this extent.  First time, ever.  And we’re really honored to have you in the room.  Great business leaders, great people of strength.

Too often, people in positions of power preach diversity while silencing, shunning, or censoring the faithful.  True tolerance means respecting the right of all people to express their deeply held religious beliefs.

Before I conclude, I want to once again thank all of the survivors in the room for their courage and resilience.  You’re an inspiration to the world.  You remind us that no force on Earth is stronger than the faith of religious believers.  The United States of America will forever remain at your side and the side of all who seek religious freedom.

Today, I ask all nations to join us in this urgent moral duty.  We ask the governments of the world to honor the eternal right of every person to follow their conscience, live by their faith, and give glory to God.  The United States has a vital role in this critical mission.

Secretary-General Guterres will now share a few words on the U.N’s efforts to promote religious liberty for all.  And he has been a champion of exactly what we’re in this room for.

So I want to thank everybody for being here.  God bless you.  God bless the faithful.  And God bless America.  Thank you very much.  (Applause.)  Thank you.

China,28-04-2016 00:00,H.E. Xi Jinping,Jointly Create a Better Future of Peace and Prosperity for Asia Through Dialogue and Consensus,"Foreign Ministers,
Distinguished Guests,
Ladies and Gentlemen,
Dear Friends,

Welcome to Beijing in the delightful season of late spring when the skyline is all lush green. At the outset, on behalf of the Chinese government and people and in my own name, I would like to extend my sincere welcome to the foreign ministers and representatives from CICA member states and observers and leading officials and representatives from relevant international organizations. Let me also offer my warm congratulations on the opening of the meeting.

This is the first time for China to host the CICA Foreign Ministers' Meeting, which is an important occasion for promoting security and development in Asia and strengthening CICA's capacity in the new era. The meeting, under the theme of ""promoting security through dialogue"", will help pool consensus, contribute to security in Asia, seek common development, strengthen CICA's role, and enhance trust and coordination among CICA members. This is of great significance to security and prosperity in Asia and beyond.

The world today is experiencing historic changes like never before. Peace, development and win-win cooperation represent an unstoppable trend of our time. That said, the planet where we live is not all tranquil. To maintain world peace and promote common development remains a long and arduous journey.

Asia holds a uniquely important position in the pursuit of world peace and development. Today in Asia, peace and stability is the defining trend, and development and prosperity represent the common aspirations of the people. As a world leader in economic development, Asia enjoys vibrant regional cooperation and integration and rising strategic status in the global development landscape. On the other hand, some parts of our continent are still plagued by turbulence and conflicts caused by traditional security challenges while terrorism and other non-traditional security threats are posing rising dangers to Asia. The situation cries out for ever closer regional security cooperation.

At the CICA Summit in Shanghai in 2014, I proposed a vision on common, comprehensive, cooperative and sustainable security in Asia and called for joint efforts to explore an inclusive and win-win approach to Asian security that is for all and by all. Developments in the region and the world over the past two years show that it takes concerted efforts to uphold regional security. We need to adhere to and follow through the vision on Asian security, build consensus, step up dialogue and coordination, contribute to the fostering of a security governance model with Asian features, and open up a brighter future of peace and prosperity for Asia. To this end, we need to focus our endeavor in the following areas:

First, keep to the direction of building an Asian community of common future. Countries in Asia share weal and woe and the future of our nations is closely tied with each other. We need to develop a new type of partnership featuring win-win cooperation and live together in the spirit of mutual respect, equality, mutual assistance and solidarity. We should accommodate reasonable concerns of others while pursuing our own interests, promote common development while seeking our own development, respect security of others while safeguarding our own security, and join hands in advancing peace, stability and prosperity in the region. We need to deepen security cooperation and confidence-building in military, political, economic, people-to-people, cultural, environmental protection and other fields as well as in tackling emerging threats and challenges, so as to open up new prospects for security and development in Asia.

Second, cement the foundation for exchanges and mutual learning among different civilizations. Asia is home to a diversity of nations, religions and cultures, and countries vary in social system, development path and economic development level. Our perceptions and concerns on relevant security issues may not always be the same. Given such a reality, we need to scale up exchanges and communication and turn the diversity of Asia into an impetus for more exchanges and cooperation, and facilitate inclusiveness, mutual learning and common development of different civilizations, to make joint contribution to maintaining regional peace and stability. We can together explore channels and platforms, such as an Asia Civilization Dialogue Conference to pool wisdom and strength and solidify the foundation for comprehensive regional security governance.

Third, uphold mutual understanding and mutual accommodation and peaceful settlement of disputes through dialogue and consultation. As a Chinese adage reads, ""he who cherishes virtue prospers and he who favors might perishes."" The law of the jungle goes against the trend of the time and belligerence cannot lead to peace. Only mutual understanding and mutual accommodation will bring about stability and only commitment to justice can ensure lasting security. We need to uphold peaceful settlement of disputes through dialogue and consultation in accordance with international law. We need to enhance trust, resolve disagreements and promote security through dialogue. Faced with complex regional hotspot issues, relevant parties need to stay calm and commit to peace, refrain from taking actions that may escalate the situation, promote crisis management through rules-making, and de-escalate tension by strengthening mutual trust, with a view to defusing crisis through political means and promoting gradual resolution.

Fourth, gradually explore the building of a security architecture that fits regional conditions. There exist multiple security cooperation frameworks in Asia, and they all contribute to regional security in their own way. Asian countries have long cherished the Asian way of mutual respect, consensus-building and accommodation of each other's comfort levels. We should uphold and promote this approach, strengthen coordination among regional security frameworks, and gradually channel cooperation toward the same or similar goals to create synergy and work for practical results. On such basis, we may explore the building of a new architecture of regional security cooperation that reflects Asian needs. We can discuss relevant matters at such platforms as the CICA Non-governmental Forum and put forward ideas and suggestions on the principles and priorities of regional security cooperation.

People around the world yearn for cooperation and inclusiveness. And countries and peoples in Asia have the ability and see the pressing need to maintain a sound environment of security and development in Asia through dialogue and cooperation. Asians are known to be open, inclusive and visionary. We welcome countries outside the region making positive contribution to peace and stability here and working with Asian countries to promote security, stability, development and prosperity of Asia. A stable and developing Asia is a blessing, while a turbulent and declining Asia would bring nothing but trouble to the world. This is a profound lesson drawn from modern Asian history.

Ladies and Gentlemen,
Dear Friends,

China follows a foreign policy of peace. We proposed and have taken the lead in practicing a new Asian approach of common, comprehensive, cooperative and sustainable security, and have worked all along to uphold, promote and contribute to international and regional security. China is firmly committed to pursuing the peaceful development path, maintaining the international order with the purposes and principles of the UN Charter at its core, fostering a new type of international relations of win-win cooperation, and building a community of shared future for all mankind. Over the years, China has worked together with the international community to tackle security risks, challenges and crises in the region and beyond, and have made positive contributions along the way.

The world cares about Asia, and what happens in Asia impacts the whole world. Some security hotspots in Asia have recently caught the international limelight, and China has made great efforts towards their resolution.

The situation on the Korean Peninsula has been tense since the beginning of the year. China has made huge efforts to manage the situation and push for dialogue and negotiation among various parties. We are committed to denuclearization, to peace and stability on the Peninsula, and to the resolution of issues through dialogue and consultation. As a permanent member of the UN Security Council, China has implemented relevant Security Council resolutions fully and faithfully. As a close neighbor, we will never allow war or chaos on the Peninsula, as this serves nobody's interests. We hope that various parties will exercise restraint, avoid mutual provocation and escalation of tension, make joint efforts to bring the nuclear issue back to the track of dialogue and negotiation as early as possible, and work toward peace and security in Northeast Asia.

Afghanistan is undergoing a crucial phase of transition. Confronted with challenges on multiple fronts, it needs strong support of the international community. China has taken an active part in the Istanbul Process on Afghanistan, and worked hard to support peaceful reconstruction as well as the Afghan-led and Afghan-owned process of inclusive political reconciliation. We sincerely hope to see an early restoration of peace, stability and development in Afghanistan. We will, together with the international community, continue to support peace and reconstruction, political reconciliation and smooth transition in Afghanistan.

An early settlement of the Syrian issue and Palestine-Israel issue serves the interests of parties concerned and represents the common aspiration of the international community. China has always called for the peaceful settlement of relevant issues through political negotiations, actively promoted talks and reconciliation through various means, and will continue to make efforts in this direction. China played a constructive role in the conclusion of the comprehensive agreement of the Iranian nuclear issue. We will work with other parties to ensure continuous progress in its implementation.

For some time, developments in the South China Sea have attracted extensive attention. Let me stress that China is committed to maintaining peace and stability in the South China Sea. We firmly stand by our sovereignty and rights and interests in the South China Sea, and remain committed to resolving disputes peacefully through friendly consultation and negotiation with countries directly concerned. We will continue to work with ASEAN countries to make the South China Sea a sea of peace, friendship and cooperation.

Ladies and Gentlemen,
Dear Friends,

Since taking over the CICA presidency in 2014, China has earnestly performed its duties and endeavored to advance fruitful dialogue and cooperation across the board. In the next two years of our new term, we will work with other parties to raise CICA's profile in regional security and development affairs. Here, I would like to express heartfelt thanks to all of you for your great support for China's presidency.

The Chinese people are making united efforts to complete the building of a moderately prosperous society in all respects and fulfill the Chinese dream of great renewal of the Chinese nation. China's development will bring more opportunities and benefits to all countries and peoples. While pursuing the Chinese dream, the Chinese people will support people from other countries in realizing their own dreams, so that together, we will make the Asian dream of enduring peace and common prosperity come true and open up a great future for Asia.

In conclusion, I wish this meeting a complete success.

Thank you.",President,Xi Jinping,https://www.fmprc.gov.cn/mfa_eng/wjdt_665385/zyjh_665391/t1359296.shtml,,INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS
USA,18-10-2014,Barack Obama,"
Weekly Address: What You Need To Know About Ebola"," Today, I want to take a few minutes to speak with you-directly and clearly-about Ebola: what we're doing about it, and what you need to know.  Because meeting a public health challenge like this isn't just a job for government.  All of us-citizens, leaders, the media-have a responsibility and a role to play.  This is a serious disease, but we can't give in to hysteria or fear-because that only makes it harder to get people the accurate information they need.  We have to be guided by the science.  We have to remember the basic facts.

First, what we're seeing now is not an ""outbreak"" or an ""epidemic"" of Ebola in America.  We're a nation of more than 300 million people.  To date, we've seen three cases of Ebola diagnosed here-the man who contracted the disease in Liberia, came here and sadly died; the two courageous nurses who were infected while they were treating him.  Our thoughts and our prayers are with them, and we're doing everything we can to give them the best care possible.  Now, even one infection is too many.  At the same time, we have to keep this in perspective.  As our public health experts point out, every year thousands of Americans die from the flu.

Second, Ebola is actually a difficult disease to catch.  It's not transmitted through the air like the flu.  You cannot get it from just riding on a plane or a bus.  The only way that a person can contract the disease is by coming into direct contact with the bodily fluids of somebody who is already showing symptoms.  I've met and hugged some of the doctors and nurses who've treated Ebola patients.  I've met with an Ebola patient who recovered, right in the Oval Office.  And I'm fine.

Third, we know how to fight this disease.  We know the protocols.  And we know that when they're followed, they work.  So far, five Americans who got infected with Ebola in West Africa have been brought back to the United States-and all five have been treated safely, without infecting healthcare workers. 

And this week, at my direction, we're stepping up our efforts.  Additional CDC personnel are on the scene in Dallas and Cleveland.  We're working quickly to track and monitor anyone who may have been in close contact with someone showing symptoms.  We're sharing lessons learned so other hospitals don't repeat the mistakes that happened in Dallas.  The CDC's new Ebola rapid response teams will deploy quickly to help hospitals implement the right protocols.  New screening measures are now in place at airports that receive nearly all passengers arriving from Liberia, Guinea and Sierra Leone.  And we'll continue to constantly review our measures, and update them as needed, to make sure we're doing everything we can to keep Americans safe.

Finally, we can't just cut ourselves off from West Africa, where this disease is raging.  Our medical experts tell us that the best way to stop this disease is to stop it at its source-before it spreads even wider and becomes even more difficult to contain.  Trying to seal off an entire region of the world-if that were even possible-could actually make the situation worse.  It would make it harder to move health workers and supplies back and forth.  Experience shows that it could also cause people in the affected region to change their travel, to evade screening, and make the disease even harder to track.

So the United States will continue to help lead the global response in West Africa.  Because if we want to protect Americans from Ebola here at home, we have to end it over there.  And as our civilian and military personnel serve in the region, their safety and health will remain a top priority.

As I've said before, fighting this disease will take time.  Before this is over, we may see more isolated cases here in America.  But we know how to wage this fight.  And if we take the steps that are necessary, if we're guided by the science-the facts, not fear-then I am absolutely confident that we can prevent a serious outbreak here in the United States, and we can continue to lead the world in this urgent effort.",President,Barack Obama,https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/the-press-office/2014/10/18/weekly-address-what-you-need-know-about-ebola,,INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS
USA,21-07-2014,Barack Obama,"
Statement by the President on the Situation in Ukraine and Gaza"," Good morning, everybody.  I want to make a brief statement about the tragedy in Ukraine.  Before I do, though, I want to note that Secretary Kerry has departed for the Middle East.  As I’ve said many times, Israel has a right to defend itself against rocket and tunnel attacks from Hamas.  And as a result of its operations, Israel has already done significant damage to Hamas’s terrorist infrastructure in Gaza.  I’ve also said, however, that we have serious concerns about the rising number of Palestinian civilian deaths and the loss of Israeli lives.  And that is why it now has to be our focus and the focus of the international community to bring about a cease-fire that ends the fighting and that can stop the deaths of innocent civilians, both in Gaza and in Israel.

So Secretary Kerry will meet with allies and partners.  I’ve instructed him to push for an immediate cessation of hostilities based on a return to the November 2012 cease-fire agreement between Israel and Hamas in Gaza.  The work will not be easy.  Obviously, there are enormous passions involved in this and some very difficult strategic issues involved.  Nevertheless, I’ve asked John to do everything he can to help facilitate a cessation to hostilities.  We don’t want to see any more civilians getting killed.

With respect to Ukraine, it’s now been four days since Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 was shot down over territory controlled by Russian-backed separatists in Ukraine.  Over the last several days, our hearts have been absolutely broken as we’ve learned more about the extraordinary and beautiful lives that were lost -- men, women and children and infants who were killed so suddenly and so senselessly.

Our thoughts and prayers continue to be with their families around the world who are going through just unimaginable grief.  I’ve had the opportunity to speak to a number of leaders around the world whose citizens were lost on this flight, and all of them remain in a state of shock but, frankly, also in a state of outrage. 

Our immediate focus is on recovering those who were lost, investigating exactly what happened, and putting forward the facts.  We have to make sure that the truth is out and that accountability exists. 

Now, international investigators are on the ground.  They have been organized.  I’ve sent teams; other countries have sent teams.  They are prepared, they are organized to conduct what should be the kinds of protocols and scouring and collecting of evidence that should follow any international incident like this.  And what they need right now is immediate and full access to the crash site.  They need to be able to conduct a prompt and full and unimpeded as well as transparent investigation.  And recovery personnel have to do the solemn and sacred work on recovering the remains of those who were lost.

Ukrainian President Poroshenko has declared a demilitarized zone around the crash site.  As I said before, you have international teams already in place prepared to conduct the investigation and recover the remains of those who have been lost.  But, unfortunately, the Russian-backed separatists who control the area continue to block the investigation.  They have repeatedly prevented international investigators from gaining full access to the wreckage.  As investigators approached, they fired their weapons into the air.  These separatists are removing evidence from the crash site, all of which begs the question -- what exactly are they trying to hide?

Moreover, these Russian-backed separatists are removing bodies from the crash site, oftentimes without the care that we would normally expect from a tragedy like this.  And this is an insult to those who have lost loved ones.  This is the kind of behavior that has no place in the community of nations.

Now, Russia has extraordinary influence over these separatists.  No one denies that.  Russia has urged them on.  Russia has trained them.  We know that Russia has armed them with military equipment and weapons, including anti-aircraft weapons.  Key separatist leaders are Russian citizens.  So given its direct influence over the separatists, Russia and President Putin, in particular, has direct responsibility to compel them to cooperate with the investigation.  That is the least that they can do. 

President Putin says that he supports a full and fair investigation.  And I appreciate those words, but they have to be supported by actions.  The burden now is on Russia to insist that the separatists stop tampering with the evidence, grant investigators who are already on the ground immediate, full and unimpeded access to the crash site.  The separatists and the Russian sponsors are responsible for the safety of the investigators doing their work.  And along with our allies and partners, we will be working this issue at the United Nations today. 

More broadly, as I’ve said throughout this crisis and the crisis in Ukraine generally, and I’ve said this directly to President Putin, as well as publicly, my preference continues to be finding a diplomatic resolution within Ukraine.  I believe that can still happen.  That is my preference today, and it will continue to be my preference.

But if Russia continues to violate Ukraine’s sovereignty and to back these separatists, and these separatists become more and more dangerous and now are risks not simply to the people inside of Ukraine but the broader international community, then Russia will only further isolate itself from the international community, and the costs for Russia’s behavior will only continue to increase. 

Now is the time for President Putin and Russia to pivot away from the strategy that they’ve been taking and get serious about trying to resolve hostilities within Ukraine in a way that respects Ukraine’s sovereignty and respects the right of the Ukrainian people to make their own decisions about their own lives.

And time is of the essence.  Our friends and allies need to be able to recover those who were lost.  That's the least we can do.  That's the least that decency demands.  Families deserve to be able to lay their loved ones to rest with dignity.  The world deserves to know exactly what happened.  And the people of Ukraine deserve to determine their own future. 

Thanks.",President,Barack Obama,https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/the-press-office/2014/07/21/statement-president-situation-ukraine-and-gaza,,INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS
Russia,26-01-2001,Vladimir Putin,Remarks at a Meeting of Top Members of the Russian Diplomatic Service,"Good afternoon.

I am genuinely glad to have this opportunity to visit the Foreign Ministry and take part in your meeting today. The recent months have seen many major international events which have kept us on a very tight schedule. Our conversation today is a chance to review some results and outline the range of tasks facing us.

The new foreign policy concept just presented by the Minister formulates our national interests in the world. They are related to the tasks in the field of defense and national security, and social and economic development of Russia. Perhaps for the first time in a considerable period we have a clear-cut national security and foreign policy strategy. I think it is important that in our current work we have managed to stick to the basic concepts of foreign policy and on the whole have managed to translate them into a concerted effort of many government bodies, non-governmental organisations and the business community.

You know better than anyone that the problems Russia faces in the world today are serious and large-scale. In the context of growing globalisation, which is much discussed, our country has yet to find its place in the world. In this context our strategic course is integration into the world community, the development of a broad political dialogue and mutually beneficial cooperation with all those who are willing and ready to cooperate with us.

The foreign policy priority is to create a stable and secure situation around Russia, to create conditions that would enable us to concentrate a maximum of effort and resources on meeting the social and economic challenges facing the state.

Clearly, today the arsenal of tools that we can use to influence the international situation is objectively not so large as we would like it to be and this makes it particularly important for us to forecast in advance the developments in the main areas of our foreign policy, especially where the potential for conflict is still considerable: in the Balkans, the Middle East and some other regions of the world.

Ensuring strategic stability is a key area of diplomatic efforts. We seek stable and predictable development of international relations. The fact that Washington has put on hold the deployment of the National Missile Defense system confirms that given a focused, well-thought-out and pro-active approach, with due account of the interests of our partners, real positive results can be achieved.

And there is another point I would like to make in connection with these problems. We have ratified the START II and the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty. When I say “we,” I mean our country. Russia has done everything the international community expected it to do, I stop short of using the word “demanded”, but in any case it was pressing Russia to take that step. We have done it. Now we await reciprocal steps, and I don’t think that an overwhelming majority of countries want to see a unilateral disarmament of Russia. On the contrary, in my opinion it would cause irreparable damage to the modern architecture of international relations.

This year you will be called upon to do some complicated and delicate work with our partners to preserve the 1972 Treaty. The latest statements by the officials of the new US Administration show that the dialogue can be positive. We look forward to joint work in that field.

It is also important that we have learned to uphold our interests firmly, but without any element of confrontation. We often hesitate to confront our partners with sharp questions knowing in advance that they would find them unacceptable. It is of course necessary to know and be mindful of the others’ position, but there should be no doubt as to the main benchmark: our own national interests, provided they are well argued.

Our country faces a number of challenges. They include regional conflicts, separatism, terrorism, uncontrolled migration, organised crime and others. I would like to single out the danger of international terrorism and fundamentalism of whatever stripe. We have repeatedly referred to something that is already entering international public domain: it is obvious that a terrorist “international” is emerging. And there we should work together with our partners in a coordinated way. It is in our interests to help establish effective mechanisms of international cooperation in all these areas.

The Foreign Ministry and our missions abroad should pay more attention to economic diplomacy. On the whole there is still great untapped potential in our economic work. The central staff of the Foreign Ministry often does not have a full grasp of the trade and economic issues. Let me remind you that you have long been provided with a key instrument, the Presidential Decree on the coordinating role of the Foreign Ministry in the conduct of an integrated foreign policy. That instrument could be used much more effectively than it is today.

It is necessary to build a system of promoting and upholding our economic interests abroad to guarantee the maximum returns on the Russian economy and minimise the risks involved in our integration in the world economy. I think the Foreign Ministry should pay extra attention to supporting major foreign economic projects and tying them in with national interests. We should seek to create conditions abroad for Russian business that are at least as favourable as the conditions for foreign business in Russia. To do this we have of course to know what conditions exist in this country for foreign business. And I will speak in a minute about how our diplomatic corps is informed about the processes taking place in our own country.

Another aspect is helping our regions, in particular Siberia and the Far East, to break into world markets. By the way, this calls for especially close coordination both with the local administrations, the heads of the regions and the Plenipotentiary Representatives of the President to the Federal Districts. And I would like to note that being divorced from the problems of one’s own country can lead to fatal miscalculations.

A few words are in order about the geography of our foreign policy. Our unquestioned priority is the CIS countries. Russia, as everybody understands, is a natural nucleus of integration processes within the Commonwealth. And integration as a process is not an end in itself, we don’t need it in that capacity, we don’t need it as a slogan or a catch phrase. It should bring real benefits to our country and our citizens. This has been the keynote of the regular meetings of the Supreme Council of the Union State and the Council of CIS States. As the results of these summits have shown this approach is more effective in dialogue with our partners, not only is it acceptable to them, they are interested in it themselves.

Each time I visit Commonwealth countries I meet the representatives of the Russian-speaking community. And I must say that they have many complaints about the way we work in this sphere. It applies not only to diplomatic services. It applies to the efforts of the Government in this sphere in general, but also to the diplomatic service, both in terms of information and politics, and in terms of dealing with people. We are obviously not doing enough to protect our diaspora, to protect the Russian culture and the Russian language. The millions of people who have overnight been separated from their country are not to blame. This should be the starting premise. I am aware that working with people is taxing and calls for a lot of patience and tact. The consular service has to do a huge amount of work, and this is a feature of the activities of diplomats in the CIS countries. This work calls for professional training and certain personal qualities.

There is much work to be done in Europe, traditionally one of the most important areas of our activities. Europe today is witnessing complicated dynamic processes. European structures are being transformed and the roles of major European organisations and regional forums are changing. Our relations with the European Union are becoming more important. Of course, it is not our aim today to become a member of the EU. But we must seek to make our cooperation much more effective and improve its quality. In striking contrast to the generally favourable background, there are some problems Russia faces in the Baltics, and Central and Eastern Europe. The Foreign Ministry can do more in this direction. One example is putting our relations with Poland on an even keel. The time has come to give serious thought to rectifying the situation in some other areas.

The process of rebuilding our relations with the North Atlantic bloc has been difficult. They have been thrown back after the Balkan events and I am convinced that it was not through our fault. The quality of interaction is gradually being restored, which is welcome. NATO is a real quantity in European and world politics. If we manage to build our relations in the spirit of frankness, openness and constructive interaction it would contribute substantially to European stability and our own security. I would like to stress that it is in the interests of our states. Even so, we still consider the policy of NATO expansion to be a mistake and we openly reject it in our dialogue with the Alliance.

Asia is becoming a more and more important area. Let me say from the start that it would be wrong to measure whether we have more priorities in Europe or in Asia. We cannot afford either a Western or an Eastern tilt. The reality is that a power which occupies such a geopolitical position as Russia has national interests everywhere. We should consistently adhere to that line. We should gain a firm foothold in Asian affairs. The road to this lies through intensified participation in the main integration structures in the Asia-Pacific region and, equally important, through a sustained effort to expand friendly relations and practical cooperation with the leading Asian states, in the first place with our neighbours.

I would like to dwell on a point which, I am convinced, should be a central issue for the Foreign Ministry and diplomatic missions. I am referring to the need to contribute towards a positive perception of Russia abroad. So far the situation in this sphere is anything but favourable. I won’t expand on it, you know what is happening in this sphere better than I do. I think that some people still feel that they stand to gain from cultivating the image of a dangerous Russia, which helps them to justify their buildup of military muscle and the use of force in international affairs. But, thank God, there is a growing awareness in the world that Russia has changed in a fundamental way. And that undoubtedly has an impact on the character of international relations today. All we have to do is to make competent and skilful use of it in our work, and not just to make use of it, but to promote this awareness. Influencing public sentiment abroad is emerging as one of the most pressing and relevant foreign policy tasks. We should dramatically upgrade our work in this area. We should use all the available vehicles: appearances in the media, broader contacts among NGOs, promoting the achievements of our culture and science. It is the duty of our diplomatic missions to study public sentiments and come up with ideas and do coordination work. I would like to stress the need to work more actively with the foreign mass media. Members of the Foreign Ministry must explain the Russian position on all the issues that arise both inside and outside the country.

In conclusion I think it is important and necessary to note that during the past year we had a very tight schedule, we have in fact been catching up on lost time in working out a strategy and in practical actions in the world. Russia took part in 260 international events at the summit level alone. Diplomatic activities have helped to solve many problems which in principle should have been tackled by other quarters and other means. But we have done it with your help because other resources have proved to be insufficient. You have done very intensive, responsible and effective work. And I would like to thank you for it. Thank you. ",President,Vladimir Putin,http://en.kremlin.ru/events/president/transcripts/statements/21169,,INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS
China,10-04-2014 00:00,Li Keqiang,Full text of Li Keqiang's speech at opening ceremony of Boao Forum,"Dear Guests,
Ladies and Gentlemen,
Dear Friends,

In the lovely spring, I am delighted to meet with friends from 52 countries and regions at the Boao Forum for Asia Annual Conference 2014 in the beautiful island of Hainan. On behalf of the Chinese government, I wish to extend warm congratulations on the opening of the annual conference and a hearty welcome to all forum participants.

The Boao Forum for Asia has entered its 12th year, and it has become an important platform with an Asian focus and a global vision. ""Boao"", the site of the Forum, means ""enchanting water and abundant fish"" in Chinese, and I think it is a symbol of the Forum's fruitful achievements. Attending this year's annual conference are many heads of government from Asia-Pacific and Africa, and a great number of business leaders, and think tank and media representatives. Friends, both old and new, are meeting here to discuss ways to boost development of both Asia and the world. Exchange of views will create new vision, and more interactions bring friends closer. I hope that you will be fully engaged in forum discussions, and I look forward to benefiting from your insights.

Our world today is undergoing profound changes. The international architecture faces new adjustment. Uncertainties and destabilizing factors affecting the global and regional environment are increasing. Hotspot issues emerge from time to time. The world is moving towards multi-polarity amidst twists and turns. The global economy is in profound adjustment. Developed economies have seen new changes, while emerging economies have encountered new challenges, and many countries are on different economic trajectories. The global recovery has been a slow and difficult process and growth remains lackluster. To achieve strong, sustainable and balanced growth is still a daunting challenge facing all of us.

Asia is at a crucial stage of development. Asia is one of the most dynamic regions in the world. It boasts one third of the global GDP, over 4 billion people and ample supply of labor force. It enjoys distinct advantages as a late comer and has tremendous untapped development potential. That said, most Asian countries are developing nations, with low per capita GDP and uneven regional development. Over 700 million people in Asia still live below the international poverty line. Asia is faced with the huge challenge of growing the economy and improving people's livelihood. And Asian countries have to address both old problems and new ones. Ultimately, the key to solving Asia's problems lies in development. It is development that will change the world and shape the future. Development therefore remains the top priority of Asian countries.

To sustain its development momentum under the new conditions, Asia needs to find a dynamic source of development to re-energize itself. The theme of the annual conference: ""Asia's New Future: Identifying New Growth Drivers"" cannot be more relevant and is crucial to Asia and the world. Here, I wish to share with you my views as follows:

First, we should stick to the overarching goal of common development and build an Asian community of shared interests. In the age of economic globalization, no Asian countries can achieve development in isolation from each other, still less can they pursue development as a ""zero-sum game"". Rather, with our interests closely entwined, we the Asian countries need to seek mutually beneficial cooperation where ""one plus one can make more than two"" and even produces a multiplying effect in which ""two times two makes more than four"". The impact of the international financial crisis still affects us. Macro-policy adjustments made by developed countries have added uncertainty to the environment for development. Some Asian countries have experienced economic slowdown, rising inflation, and even capital flight and currency depreciation. Pessimistic views about the prospects of emerging economies have resurfaced. Faced with these new developments and new problems, we countries in Asia should continue to act in the spirit of solidarity in face of difficulties, turn our strong economic complementarity into mutual support for each other's development, expand convergence of interests and achieve mutually beneficial coexistence and win-win development.

In the past decade and more, intra-regional trade in Asia has expanded from US$1 trillion to US$3 trillion, and its share of total trade of all Asian countries increased from 30% to 50%. Yet this is still far less than that in the EU. Regional economic integration meets the interests of all Asian countries. We need to work in unison to promote trade liberalization and investment facilitation, and upgrade regional and sub-regional cooperation. The negotiation on the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) is the largest trade agreement negotiation with the most extensive participation in Asia, and the RCEP is integration of existing mature free trade areas. Being highly inclusive and based on Asia's industrial structure, economic model and social tradition, the RCEP is a phased-in arrangement that accommodates member countries at different levels of development, and it does not exclude other regional trading arrangements. China will work with all other parties to accelerate the negotiating process. At the same time, the launching of a feasibility study on a Free Trade Area of the Asia-Pacific (FTAAP) may be considered to maximize the benefits of trade and investment in the Asia-Pacific. China takes an open position towards the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP). As long as the TPP is conducive to the development of global trade and the fostering of an equitable and open trading environment, China is happy to see its conclusion. We are committed to upholding the central role of the WTO multilateral trading system in global trade development. Both the RCEP and the TPP should become important supplements to the multilateral trading system, and these two mechanisms should go hand in hand and reinforce each other. We hope that agreement can be reached on the RCEP by 2015. As a Chinese saying goes, ""When everybody puts firewood in the fire, the flame rises high."" As long as the Asian countries make concerted efforts, we can ensure that Asia will continue to serve as an important engine driving the global economy.

Second, we should foster a general environment for integrated development and form an Asian community of common destiny. Economic integration is central to achieving common development in Asia. Asia's beautiful future hinges upon not only the development of each and every country but, more importantly, the common progress of the whole region. As a Chinese adage aptly puts it, ""A single thread cannot be spun into a cord. And a single tree cannot create a forest."" We the Asian countries need to deepen result-oriented cooperation in all fields, pursue integration through opening-up and development through integration, strengthen economic ties, seize the opportunity of innovation-driven development, and thus hold the destiny of development in our own hands.

Infrastructure connectivity is a basic condition for integrated development. Countries in the region should join hands and speed up infrastructure construction including rail, road, air and water transportation. China is ready to work with countries involved to draw up plans for building the Bangladesh-China-India-Myanmar (BCIM) Economic Corridor and the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor, and upgrade China-ASEAN FTA. China will continue to promote the important projects of the Silk Road Economic Belt and the 21st Century Maritime Silk Road this year. China is ready to intensify consultations with relevant parties in and outside Asia on the preparations for the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank and hopes that the bank can be officially launched at an early date. Industrial complementarity is a key aspect of integrated development. We the Asian countries should take advantage of our geographical proximity to deepen cooperation across the upstream, mid-stream and downstream industrial chains, and build an industrial network and economic system that draw on our respective comparative strengths. The destiny of the Asian economy hinges on reform, innovation and structural adjustment. Asian countries need to ride the global trend of new technology revolution, enhance exchanges, and draw on each other's experience to advance scientific and technological progress and personnel training, especially young people, boost the ""new economy"" featuring green development, energy, environmental protection and the internet so as to seize an advantageous position in future development and raise industrial and economic competitiveness. This will not only increase the internal impetus for achieving sustained development in our region, but also create new opportunities for global economic recovery.

Third, we should maintain the general environment of peaceful development and build an Asian community of shared responsibilities. Regional turbulence courts disaster while stability in the neighborhood brings prosperity. Asia owes its progress to a peaceful and stable regional environment, and peace and stability are the fundamental safeguards for Asia's development. Sixty years ago, China, India and Myanmar jointly initiated the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, which have become basic norms governing international relations. These principles embody Oriental wisdom and represent a major contribution to human civilization, and we should pass on the vision of peaceful coexistence from generation to generation. A close neighbor is better than a kinsman afar, and close neighbors can become best friends. To achieve peace and stability in Asia, we the Asian countries should build consensus, make active efforts and jointly fulfill our due responsibilities. We should promote security dialogue and consultation, strengthen cooperation on non-traditional security issues, including disaster management, maritime search and rescue, counter-terrorism and combating transnational crimes, and actively explore the establishment of a regional security cooperation framework in Asia.

Here I wish to emphasize that China is committed to peaceful development. We pursue a neighborhood policy of building amity and friendship, and we are firm in our resolve to uphold China's territorial sovereignty. We also follow a clear-cut policy of seeking peaceful solutions to disputes. We will give full support to initiatives that help strengthen maritime cooperation. We will not accept acts that undermine stability in the South China Sea. We Chinese believe in repaying kindness with kindness and meeting wrongdoing with justice. We value friendship and never treat friends unfairly, and we also stand by principles and firmly uphold our fundamental position. A peaceful and stable South China Sea is in the interest of all littoral countries, including China. China is ready to steadily advance consultation on a code of conduct in the South China Sea within the framework of the Declaration on the Conduct of Parties in the South China Sea, and work with other countries to ensure peace, stability and freedom of navigation in the South China Sea. China loves peace and cherishes development. It is ready to work with other countries in the region to build a peaceful, prosperous and open Asia and maintain peace, stability and tranquility in our neighborhood by enhancing political mutual trust.

Ladies and Gentlemen,

Asia's development is important to the future of the world, and China's development is closely bound up with Asia.

To keep China's economy running within a proper range is both a basic target of China's current macro-control and its medium-to-long-term policy goal. We have set this year's target of economic growth at about 7.5%. The word ""about"" indicates that there is a range for the GDP growth. As long as there is fairly sufficient employment and no major fluctuations, the actual GDP growth will be considered to be within the proper range, be it slightly higher or lower than the 7.5% target. Statistics show that urban employment continued to increase, individual income, corporate profits and fiscal revenue registered steady growth, consumer prices remained stable, growth of electricity consumption started to rise and there were positive dynamics in structural adjustment. In short, the Chinese economy has got off to a stable and good start. On the other hand, the upturn of the Chinese economy is not yet on a solid footing, downward pressure still exists, and difficulties in some fields must not be underestimated. These problems show the impact exerted on China by the complex international environment; they also reflect the deep-seated economic challenges that have become prominent and the economic slowdown that China faces.

Preparedness ensures success. Faced with this complex situation, we need to calmly assess the current developments, stay focused, and take initiatives as called for. In exercising macro-control, we will endeavor to strike a balance between aggregate supply and demand, focus on improving the economic structure, ensure proper policy intensity of macro-control in the light of changing situation and take targeted and differentiated measures as appropriate. Last year, we pursued creative thinking and methods in exercising macro-control and gained new experience in this regard. We will not resort to short-term massive stimulus policies just because of temporary economic fluctuations and we will pay more attention to sound development in the medium to long run and strive for sustained and sound economic development. With all the principles established and policy options at our disposal, we can handle all possible risks and challenges. China's development has strong resilience. We have the capabilities and confidence to keep the economy functioning within the proper range.

There are conditions in place for the Chinese economy to achieve sustained sound growth. China has a big economy and large foreign exchange reserves. With broad market space, there is much room for coordinated progress in advancing the new type of industrialization, IT application, urbanization and agricultural modernization. In particular, population in the central, western and northeastern regions accounts for over 60% of the national total, and per capita GDP has just exceeded US$5,000. Efforts to narrow the gap between urban and rural areas and among different regions will unleash huge potential of growth. We have introduced a series of policies to advance reform, adjust structure and benefit the people, and more such measures are under consideration. All these will have a sustained effect of ensuring steady growth.

Steady growth is possible only with a solid foundation just as long distance can be covered only by a vehicle with a high-powered engine. The Chinese economy has the basis for steady growth. It not only enjoys good conditions for maintaining medium to high speed growth in the time to come, but also inexhaustible impetus for sustained development. Under the theme of identifying new growth drivers, we will make multi-pronged efforts in the following three areas:

First, we will create impetus by deepening reform. The market has huge vitality and the people have indefinite creativity. We will work harder to streamline administration and delegate more power to lower level governments. We will introduce a system of listing government powers, consider the adoption of a management model based on a negative list approach, accumulate useful experience through the development of the China (Shanghai) Pilot Free Trade Zone and spread it to other areas. This will enable us to expand market access, foster a better business environment, encourage fair competition, develop a law-based economy, unleash greater dividends of reform, spark social creativity, and stabilize market expectations. Opening-up is also a kind of reform and can boost reform. We will carry out a new round of opening-up at a high level. An important part of this endeavor is to further open up the services sector, including the capital market. For example, we will actively create conditions to establish a Shanghai-Hong Kong stock exchanges connectivity mechanism, and further promote two-way opening-up and healthy development of the capital markets on the mainland and Hong Kong. We will continue to raise the level and quality of opening-up through deeper integration with the international market.

Second, we will create impetus by adjusting economic structure. We will narrow urban-rural and regional development gaps and address the unreasonable industrial structure to push forward structural adjustment through structural reform. We will speed up efforts to improve the services sector, which is our weak link, extend the pilot VAT reform to postal, telecommunications and other services sectors, use tax tools to develop producer and consumer services, and use more private capital to increase the supply of old-age support, health, tourism, cultural, sports and other services. We will implement a new type of people-centered urbanization, address the bifurcation between urban and rural areas and within cities, and grant urban residency in an orderly manner to rural people who have moved to cities. The government will increase support and use market tools to rebuild more rundown areas. We will expand development from the coastal areas to the inland regions in a phased way and nurture new economic support belts along the Yangtze River waterway and important land transportation trunks. We will push forward the construction of rail, road and other transport infrastructure in central and western regions to foster favorable conditions for industrial relocation. We will also promote the development of green industries, new energy, and energy-conserving and environment friendly technologies and products to foster new growth areas, and resolutely eliminate backward production facilities in this process to ease the resources and environmental constraints. We will increase the size of the national guidance fund for venture capital in emerging industries, leverage the role of innovation in spurring development, move industries up the value chain, and raise the productivity of factors of production.

Third, we will create impetus by improving people's livelihood. The purpose of development is to improve people's lives. The 1.3 billion Chinese represent the largest consumer market and source of demand in the world. And as people's lives improve, the domestic demand will play a greater role in driving economic growth. We need to increase people's income as the economy grows. And employment is the source of income and crucial for people's lives. We will implement a more energetic policy for employment and entrepreneurship and give greater fiscal, tax and financial support and services to university graduates and unemployed people when they seek jobs or start their own businesses. We have substantially raised the limit of annual taxable income of small and micro companies eligible for halved corporate income tax from 60,000 yuan to 100,000 yuan. We will also introduce more tax breaks to encourage individually-owned businesses and enterprises to hire more. We want to steadily raise people's incomes by creating more jobs and start-ups. We will improve the social safety net and public services so that people will have no worries. We will take a comprehensive set of policies to boost consumer spending, raise people's spending power, increase consumption of goods and services and reduce distribution costs so that consumption can provide greater support for economic development.

Having registered rapid growth over the past three decades and more, the Chinese economy has entered a new stage of improving quality and performance. We need to overcome stumbling blocks on the way forward and make steady progress towards achieving our long-term goals. We will pool the courage, vision and strength of over one billion people to write a new chapter in the ""China story"" and endeavor to realize the great Chinese dream of national renewal.

Ladies and Gentlemen,

We live in an era of interdependence. Never has the world been so closely connected as it is today; and never has Asia needed win-win cooperation so much as it does today. Success can only be achieved when the wisdom of all is pooled. We the Asian countries should work closely to uphold regional peace and stability, promote development in our region, build a common homeland for us and contribute more to world peace, development and cooperation. China will forge ahead and share weal and woe with other Asian countries in a joint effort to open up new vistas for Asia's development.

In conclusion, I wish the forum full success and all the guests coming from afar and friends attending the conference a fruitful and enjoyable stay here and good health.

Thank you!",Premier,Xi Jinping,https://www.fmprc.gov.cn/mfa_eng/wjdt_665385/zyjh_665391/t1145980.shtml,,INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS
USA,28-11-2018 00:00,Donald Trump,Remarks by President Trump at the National Christmas Tree Lighting Ceremony,"THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you.  Thank you very much.  And, Ryan, I want to thank you for doing such a beautiful job all throughout the season.  And welcome everyone.  Merry Christmas.  Special time of the year.

Melania and I are thrilled to be here today as we celebrate one of the nation’s most cherished traditions: the lighting of the National Christmas Tree.

Tonight’s ceremony is only possible because of the hard work of the many talented individuals.  They were working late at night.  They were working early in the morning.  They were working all the time.  And my sincere thanks to everyone at the National Park Service and the National Park Foundation.  Thank you very much.  Appreciate it.  (Applause.)

And let me also extend my deep appreciation to all of tonight’s wonderful entertainers.  There’s great talent.  They’re going on to big things, many of them.  I’ve seen them and they are something very special.  Thank you very much.  That was a great job tonight.  (Applause.)

And this includes one very special group that has topped Billboard charts multiple times: the Dominican Sisters, who I met backstage, from Ann Arbor, Michigan.  (Applause.)

And a very special recognition to the students who designed stunning ornaments to decorate 56 different Christmas trees here in President’s Park.  Thank you, students.  I hear you out there.  Thank you very much.  (Applause.)

And in — when they were doing the 56 trees, there were one for each state and the territories in our magnificent country.  We have truly a great, great country.  We’re very proud of it, and we love it deeply.  (Applause.)

For Christians all across our nation, around the world, this is a sacred season that begins 2,000 years ago when Jesus Christ was born.  An angel declared to the shepherds tending their flocks, “Behold, I bring you good tidings, great joy, which shall be to all people.  For unto you is a born this day in the city of David a Saviour, which is Christ the Lord.”  (Applause.)  There in Bethlehem, Mary and Joseph held in their hands the son of God; the light of the world; and, through Him, the promise of eternal salvation.

No matter one’s faith or beliefs, the Christmas season reflects all that is best in the American spirit.  This is a time of the year for rejoicing with our family and friends, for spreading charity and goodwill in our commitment all over this country in all of our communities, and for giving thanks for all of the blessings in our lives.

We are especially thankful for the countless Americans who have given their time and passion to help those in need.  Here in the audience today are a number of extraordinary foster families and guardians joined by the beautiful children they have welcomed into their homes.  And beautiful children they are.  Your devotion inspires us all.  To every child in foster care: You are the precious loved one and gift of God.  Thank you.  Thank you.  (Applause.)  Very, very special.

At this time of the year, we renew the bonds of affection between our fellow citizens, and we awaken the faith in our hearts that calls each of us to action.  As we gather loved ones, our thoughts turn to those who are rebuilding their lives after devastating wildfires, destructive hurricanes, and terrible tragedy.

We are one American family.  We hurt together, we heal together, and we will always pull through together.  This is the United States of America.  We are the best in the world, and there’s nobody close.  (Applause.)

Tonight, we honor the first responders who risked their lives to save the lives of others.  And all of America sends our profound gratitude to the incredible men and women of the United States Military. (Applause.)  And I’m proud to say our military right now is stronger than ever before.  (Applause.)

Their families are all our families, and we thank them so much for their greatness and for the incredible job they do.  Thank you to the United States Military.  Thank you very much.  (Applause.)

We ask God to watch over this nation’s heroes, and to shed his almighty grace upon our nation.  And we pray that America’s light will shine more brightly and stronger than ever.  And it will.

On behalf of Melania and myself and the entire Trump family — many of whom are with us tonight — I want to again wish you all a very, very Merry Christmas.  May this Christmas season bring peace to your hearts, warmth to your homes, cheer to your spirit, and joy to the world.  Merry Christmas, everyone.  Merry Christmas and God bless you.  Thank you.  Thank you very much.  (Applause.)",President,Donald Trump,https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefings-statements/remarks-president-trump-national-christmas-tree-lighting-ceremony/,,OTHERS
Russia,24-03-2006,Vladimir Putin,Opening Remarks at the State Council Meeting on the Development of Education in the Russian Federation,"Good afternoon, dear colleagues,

Today we are examining the issue of developing our country’s education sector.

We all know that high-level education is the starting point for economic, scientific and technological progress. Any fall behind in educational development has direct consequences for a country’s competitiveness and future.

Over these last years we have undertaken targeted and consistent action to develop the country’s education system. We have put what amount to considerable resources for our country into education development. Federal budget expenditure on education has undergone an almost five-fold increase over the last five years, while consolidated budget education expenditure has seen a three-fold increase. We are not just talking about a percentage-point increase here, but about a several-fold rise in spending. What’s more, a considerable amount of this increased spending is coming from the regional and municipal budgets.

But fundamental modernisation has still not taken place in the sector. One of the aims of the national project in the education sector is precisely to give an impulse to transformation and bring about real change. The regions have received additional funding to support teachers and talented young people, to buy new technical equipment and develop the use of information technology.

I would like to express my thanks to the country’s regions and to you, dear colleagues, for your active participation in realising this project and, of course, for your own regional initiatives and the additional funds you are contributing.

I will repeat once again the priority tasks in this sector.

First of all, all our citizens should have access to education of the best national and international standards. This is our most fundamental objective.

We also need to establish principally new evaluation criteria for education quality, criteria based on the needs of society, the economy, employers and the labour market.

Second, we need to introduce new management methods and financial mechanisms to our education sector.

The regions and the education community itself can and should be more bold and active today in introducing targeted funding based on specific student numbers. Funding should go towards the education of concrete individuals – students, pupils. After all, in education it is the final result that is important and not faceless accounts of an establishment’s functioning.

The government should allocate the necessary funds to assist the regional authorities in developing and introducing these new funding systems in schools. The objective is to make sure that budget spending is used more effectively, raise the quality of education, better protect children’s health and promote educational work.

I know that this work is already successfully underway in some regions, while many other regions are ready to begin it, and I ask you, dear colleagues, and the government, to provide the funding needed to support this work and to make it available this year already.

Third, the education system must be genuinely responsible for the results of educational work, for the all-round education of the individual. In this respect, the position of parents and civil society is extremely important, but teachers, who spend so much time in close contact with their pupils, should also take a direct interest in successful educational work.

The priority national project in the education sector also aims at giving teachers greater incentives to pursue this kind of all-round educational work. Teachers who receive decent wages are able to put more time and energy precisely into this kind of work rather than simply trying to put in as many teaching hours as possible.

Our task, I repeat, is to get the education system working on principles that match the needs of the times. How we will live tomorrow depends to a great extent on how we learn and study today.

The modern education system requires modern professionals to work in it. Qualified teachers are the real strength and driving force for quality change in our schools and higher education establishments.

People with the proper training and skills, qualified young people, are needed in the education system. They must bring with them new methods, new approaches and all the benefits of higher education learning. In this respect I think that the special support for innovative development programmes in a number of universities and other higher education establishments is fully justified.

Our country needs education centres that will serve as a yardstick for improving higher education and developing science in Russia. I hope that the considerable funds allocated to innovative work in higher education as part of the national education project will have a positive impact. I think and I hope that the Education and Science Ministry will prepare as thoroughly as it can to select higher education establishments that are genuinely pursuing innovative work and merit state support.

Now a few words on primary and secondary vocational education: today, training in professional and vocational schools has become just an interim step towards entering university. Sometimes the whole purpose of vocational and professional education at this level seems to have been lost, and yet its original purpose was to train qualified specialists for various sectors of our industry, the agri-business sector and the services sector.

We need today to analyse the content and direction of these professional and vocational education programmes and refocus them on the demands of our country’s business community and specific segments of the labour market. We also need to take into account specific demand for different types of specialists from one region to another. In this context the federal and regional authorities must work together and this is an area for our joint efforts.

We also need to continue transferring primary and secondary professional and vocational education establishments to the regional authorities. In the cases where this has already been done we have seen real practical results.

Dear colleagues,

Our country is taking an increasingly active part in international education processes. But the integration of education markets is possible only if people have access to global information systems and sources and only if education standards are compatible.

As the country holding the presidency of the G8 this year, Russia has proposed these systemic education issues as an item on the agenda for the G8 summit. Ultimately, quality education is in the interests of the world economy and integration of education systems helps bring cultures closer together, promotes understanding between peoples and countries and strengthens international stability.

Finally, it is the interests of Russia’s education system to expand our export of education services. Training specialists for other countries, after all, helps open the road to new markets for our country and the exchange of experience stimulates the joint search for new technology and investment. This is why we need to open foreign branches of Russian educational establishments, open Russian universities up more for foreign students and teachers, and reduce to a minimum the remaining restrictions on students from the CIS countries seeking to enter our higher education system. I ask the government to pay particular attention to this point. The CIS countries are our closest partners and their peoples share our education traditions, what’s more.

In conclusion I would like to stress once more that Russia has significant competitive advantages in the education sector and it should put them to advantageous use today. All the levels of state power must work together on this task in close partnership with the public.

Thank you for your attention. ",President,Vladimir Putin,http://en.kremlin.ru/events/president/transcripts/statements/23502,,DEVELOPMENT
Russia,19-07-2018,Vladimir Putin,Meeting of ambassadors and permanent representatives of Russia,"Colleagues, welcome to this traditional meeting.

First of all, I would like to express my gratitude to the leadership, staff and veterans of the diplomatic service for their efforts to protect Russia’s national interests and for their contribution to international cooperation.

The Ministry’s central office, our embassies and all other Russian missions abroad are acting professionally in a coordinated manner, fulfilling the tasks set before them. Russia is pursuing a responsible and independent foreign policy in a dynamically developing and eventful global situation.

I would like to point out that Russia’s active involvement in global affairs is driven by our priority national interest, which is to create favourable and safe conditions for the country’s breakthrough development, for attaining large-scale social and economic goals and for improving the quality of life for the people.

Our people want Russia to be a strong, independent and peaceful state. We are open to partnerships, to mutually beneficial and constructive relations with all countries and regional associations.

As a permanent member of the UN Security Council, Russia will continue to defend the fundamental principles documented in the UN Charter, which are sovereignty, equality of states, non-interference in other countries’ domestic affairs, and the just resolution of disputes. We believe that by observing international law and working together we can deal with the most complex world problems.

The world undoubtedly needs our approach to ensuring global security and stability, countering new threats and challenges.

Russia’s views on the best basis for a modern world order are supported by our allies in the CSTO, the CIS, BRICS and the SCO share. We all understand that they account for a large part of the world’s population. We have acted and will continue to act based on our principled positions when dealing with acute regional crises.

It was with Russia’s decisive role that international terrorism, ISIL and other extremist groups suffered a crushing blow in Syria. This allowed Syria to maintain its statehood and create conditions for its economic recovery and the return of refugees.

I want to once again thank our military personnel who courageously performed and continue to perform their professional duty, and, of course, diplomats who are as extensively and selflessly involved in the Syria issue.

With Russia’s active diplomatic efforts, the Astana process is moving forward. The Syrian National Dialogue Congress held in Sochi earlier this year was a significant achievement that deserves the closest attention, study and support. These efforts are laying a legitimate foundation for Syria’s revival.

Now on the agenda is the organisation of the Constitutional Committee to prepare for constitutional reform and subsequent elections, with support from the United Nations. Of course, it is extremely important that the international community intensify its efforts to provide humanitarian aid to the Syrians. We are working on this.

This is clearly important for Syria and the rest of the region, as well as for many other countries, because our active efforts can reduce the migration pressure on European countries.

Russia also proposed a solution for the Korean Peninsula involving collective efforts and dialogue. We joined forces with China to draft a plan for the gradual normalisation of the situation there.

It is good that the ideas proposed in that plan have been applied and that the sides have launched negotiations, showing respect for each other and refraining from actions that can have irreparable consequences. We hope that these positive trends, which were made possible also thanks to the contribution of US President Donald Trump, will continue to develop.

However, we have seen cases where agreements reached through concerned efforts were derailed overnight. I am referring to the unilateral US decision to withdraw from the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action on Iran’s nuclear programme.

This document is of crucial significance for global non-proliferation. Our task is to preserve this vital arrangement and to prevent the growing tension in the Middle East from getting out of control.

There is a serious risk of aggravation of the situation in south-eastern Ukraine. The reasons are the same as always: non-compliance of the Ukrainian authorities with their own commitments and refusal to settle the conflict peacefully.

Time and again, we see open disregard for the agreements, as well as an unwillingness to talk to their own people and a reliance on military scenarios. We believe that the Minsk Package of Measures provides fundamental grounds for a political settlement of this crisis.

Colleagues, our foreign policy efforts are not aimed at achieving some kind of speculative greatness or creating problems for others. Let me reiterate that what matters most is ensuring the right conditions for the sustainable development of our country.

In the years to come, Russia must not only firmly establish itself among the world’s top five economies, but also substantially improve the key standards related to the quality of life of its citizens. To achieve these strategic objectives we must make full use of our foreign policy opportunities.

It is important that we focus our efforts on achieving specific, pragmatic results, tap new markets, expand exports and gain access to advanced technology and investment, while overcoming the obstacles and limitations Russian companies face in foreign markets.

In today’s world, the principles of competition and openness in global trade are increasingly replaced by protectionism, while economic gain and expediency are swapped for partisan agendas and political pressure. Economic ties and entrepreneurial freedom are being politicised.

Against this backdrop, Russia’s foreign policy must run counter to this trend by being more economically driven and rational. Creating a space of good neighbourly relations, wellbeing, security and stability along the entire perimeter of our state border has special importance.

The Eurasian Economic Union is a key integration project for Russia. It is gratifying that our partners are guided by the same priorities as we are within the EAEU, and we implement them together quite effectively. The essence of these approaches is to use the opportunities arising from the integration processes to stimulate economic growth in all member countries so that citizens and businesses benefit from this cooperation.

We also believe in the importance of stepping up EAEU contacts with other countries. Its free trade area with Vietnam has been launched, and talks are underway with Israel, Serbia and Singapore. Consultations with Egypt and India are to begin soon. A temporary agreement paving the way to the creation of a free trade area with Iran has been signed. All in all, there are about 50 proposals aimed at establishing partnerships with the Eurasian Economic Union.

Good prospects are opening up due to joint efforts with China resulting from the Agreement on Trade and Economic Cooperation signed in May between Beijing and the Eurasian Economic Union.

The Eurasian Economic Union and the Belt and Road Initiative are efficiently complementing each other. Harmonisation of these projects can lay the foundation for establishing a Greater Eurasian Partnership – an economic cooperation space that is as free as possible from all barriers.

We should apply the same logic to developing relations with the European Union, which remains one of our major trade partners despite current difficulties. We have many overlapping economic interests with the EU. Our common transport and energy infrastructure has been developing for decades.

I would like to emphasise that all the business projects that we are implementing with Europe, including, for instance, Nord Stream 2, are solely commercial and economically viable; they are not politically charged and have no hidden agenda.

The key to providing security and safety in Europe is in expanding cooperation and restoring trust, and not in deploying new NATO bases and military infrastructure near Russia’s borders, which is what is taking place now.

We will respond appropriately to such aggressive steps, which pose a direct threat to Russia. Our colleagues, who are trying to aggravate the situation, seeking to include, among others, Ukraine and Georgia in the orbit of the alliance, should think about the possible consequences of such an irresponsible policy.

We need a new, positive agenda aimed at collaboration and attempts to find common ground. Of course, I discussed this during my meeting with the President of the United States, Mr Trump.

With our views being different on many matters, we agreed that Russia-US relations are deeply unsatisfactory and in many ways even worse than during the Cold War.

Of course, it would be naive to believe that the problems that piled up over years would be resolved in a matter of several hours. No one was counting on this. However, I believe that we have embarked on a path to positive changes.

Importantly, a full-fledged summit with an opportunity to talk directly has finally taken place. It was overall successful and led to productive agreements.

We will have to wait and see, of course, what turn the events will take, all the more so as certain forces in America are trying to downplay and disavow the results of the Helsinki summit.

To digress from the main subject, I would like to say a few words on a personal note, so to speak.

We see that there are forces in the United States that are willing to sacrifice Russia-US relations to promote their ambitions amid the domestic political strife in America. They are ready to sacrifice the interests of their businesses, which are losing multimillion-dollar contracts and the Russian market in general, as well as jobs in the United States, even though not many, but still there are jobs in place as part of cooperation with Russia. We are talking about tens of thousands, potentially hundreds of thousands, of jobs.

They are ready to sacrifice the interests of their allies in Europe and the Middle East, in particular, those of the State of Israel. Among other things, we discussed security at the Golan Heights during the operation in Syria. Apparently, no one is interested in it. They are ready to sacrifice even their own security.

I would like to say that the New START Treaty will expire in 2021. Generally speaking, we could have lived without it even several years ago, but we took the correct step when we signed it. Unless we start working right now to coordinate its extension, it will cease to exist in a year and a half. We will simply not have this treaty.

When I spoke about these forces, you know, this does not fit our political philosophy, because we have always been taught that officials working in the interests of the state, of society must think above all about and give priority to these fundamental interests. Unfortunately, there are forces in the United States that put their narrow group and party interests before national ones.

Our famous satirical writers once wrote about such people, “Miserable, wretched people!” But this is not quite so, at least not when it comes to this case. These are not miserable or wretched people. No, they are powerful and strong people who can shove – sorry for the mauvais ton – unbelievable and illogical stories in the face of millions of their citizens. Yes, they can really do this.

I am not saying this to scold or commend anyone. Absolutely not. I am saying this so that we take this into account in our practical work in the American direction. These are the facts of modern life,

Nevertheless, Russia is open to further contacts with the United States on an equal and mutually beneficial basis. This is what not only our people but the world as a whole need. As the world’s largest nuclear powers, we have special responsibility for strategic stability and security.

Colleagues, let me say a few words on a different topic. The 2018 FIFA World Cup ended just a few days ago. Not only the heads of state and government from many countries visited Russia, but also, and most importantly, hundreds of thousands of football fans from all across the world, who saw with their own eyes the real Russia: open, friendly and modern.

This is an obvious success and a breakthrough in what is known as public diplomacy. This is attributable, among other factors, to your contribution to preparing this large-scale event. I would like to thank you for your efforts.

Colleagues, it is obvious that the workload for the Foreign Ministry’s central office and all of Russia’s embassies will not subside moving forward. There is a lot of work for you ahead, and each and every one of you has immense responsibility.

Make no mistake: the country’s leadership remains committed to ensuring the material wellbeing and enhancing the professional status of diplomats, as well as improving social security for Ministry workers. A number of decisions has been taken to this effect.

At the same time, some sensitive matters, including that of pay, social guarantees for family members, retirement pensions and housing, have yet to be addressed. Of course, the Government will work on it.

I would like to ask the Government to keep these matters under control and prevent any formalistic or bureaucratic approaches. Let me emphasise that these efforts are aimed at ensuring that diplomats can exercise their professional duties in an enabling environment, which is extremely important in terms of increasing the efficiency of our foreign policy efforts in general.

USA,22-06-2013,Barack Obama,"
Weekly Address: Time for Congress to Pass Commonsense Immigration Reform"," Hi everybody.  Right now, the United States Senate is debating a bipartisan, commonsense bill that would be an important step toward fixing our broken immigration system. 

It’s a bill that would continue to strengthen security at our borders, and hold employers more accountable if they knowingly hire undocumented workers, so they won’t have an unfair advantage over businesses that follow the law.

It’s a bill that would modernize the legal immigration system so that, as we train American workers for the jobs of tomorrow, we’re also attracting the highly skilled entrepreneurs and engineers who grow our economy for everyone.

It’s a bill that would provide a pathway to earned citizenship for the 11 million individuals who are in this country illegally – a pathway that includes passing a background check, learning English, paying taxes and a penalty, then going to the back of the line behind everyone trying to come here legally.

And, a few days ago, a report from the Congressional Budget Office definitively showed that this bipartisan, commonsense bill will help the middle class grow our economy and shrink our deficits, by making sure that every worker in America plays by the same set of rules and pays taxes like everyone else.

According to this independent report, reforming our immigration system would reduce our deficits by almost a trillion dollars over the next two decades.  And it will boost our economy by more than 5 percent, in part because of businesses created, investments made, and technologies invented by immigrants. 

This comes on the heels of another report from the independent office that monitors Social Security’s finances, which says that this immigration bill would actually strengthen the long-term health and solvency of Social Security for future generations.

Because with this bill, millions of additional people will start paying more in taxes for things like Social Security and education.  That’ll make the economy fairer for middle-class families. 

So that’s what comprehensive immigration reform looks like.  Stronger enforcement.  A smarter legal immigration system.  A pathway to earned citizenship.  A more vibrant, growing economy that’s fairer on the middle class.  And a more stable fiscal future for our kids. 

Now, the bill isn’t perfect.  It’s a compromise.  Nobody is going to get everything they want – not Democrats, not Republicans, not me.  But it’s consistent with the principles that I and others have laid out for commonsense reform.  That’s why Republicans and Democrats, CEOs and labor leaders, are saying that now is the time to pass this bill.  If you agree with us, reach out to your Senators and Representatives.  Tell them that the time for excuses is over; it’s time to fix our broken immigration system once and for all.

We can do this, because we are a nation of laws and a nation of immigrants; a place enriched by the contributions of people from all over the world, and stronger for it.  That’s been the story of America from the start.  Let’s keep it going.  Thanks, and have a great weekend.",President,Barack Obama,https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/the-press-office/2013/06/22/weekly-address-time-congress-pass-commonsense-immigration-reform,,DEVELOPMENT
USA,08-09-2021 00:00,Joe Biden,Remarks by President Biden in Honor of Labor Unions,"THE PRESIDENT:  Jocelyn, thank you.  Please.  Please, please, please.  Thank you, Jocelyn. 

Please, sit down.  Thank you.  I — nothing to it, is there, Jocelyn?  Just walking in and stand at the podium, and — (laughter) — speaking at the White House.  Nothing to it.  You did a great job.  And thank you.  And thank you.

Before I really begin, I want to say that I think one of the biggest things that’s changed is — my dear mother, God bless her soul, used to say, “Out of everything bad, something good will come if you look hard enough for it.” 

And I think one of the good things that’s come out of this godawful crisis regarding COVID is ordinary people who never thought about the technician at the drugstore, never thought about the grocery store worker, never thought about what that firefighter has to do when they go in.  They don’t ask, “Do you have COVID or not?”  Never thought about the people who keep this country up and running before. 

I really mean this sincerely.  It’s not a — it’s not a political — it’s a reality. 

And I think people went, “Whoa, whoa.”  And instead of — which was a good thing — banging pots and pans when people came back from rescuing other folks, I think they began to realize, “You know, this is part of the deal.”  And to use my dad’s expression — and I mean it sincerely — and some — a few of you knew my dad — he said, “Everyone is entitled to be treated with dignity.”  And that’s what the labor union is all about: dignity.  It provides dignity for people who deserve to be treated differently. 

And I want to thank Jocelyn, and I want to thank President Shuler — Madam President.  And I know you didn’t expect to be in this role at this moment, but as I told you before, I believe that the future of American labor is in very good hands.  I really mean it.  Thank you.  (Applause.)

And I want to welcome everyone to the White House.  And I really mean that.  This is your house.  It’s not hyperbole.  It’s a fact.  This is your house.  I wouldn’t be here without you.  That’s, again, not hyperbole. 

In my White House, you’ll always be welcome.  You’ll always be welcome.  Labor will always be welcome.  You know, you’ve heard me say many times: I intend to be the most pro-union President leading the most pro-union administration in American history. 

But I think one of the reasons I’m able to do that is the public is changing, too.  You’ve changed the public; you’ve educated them a lot.

I want to thank the dues-paying members of the Laborers, Marty — (laughs) — Marty Walsh, who’s helping make sure that we keep the commitments across our entire government. 

And before I go any further, I’d like to pause for a moment of silence to honor the hundreds of union workers and essential workers who have died from COVID-19; and to honor a buddy, John Sweeney, who we lost earlier this year, and to honor a truly dear friend, Rich Trumka. 

A moment of silence, please.

(A moment of silence is observed.)

Thank you.  This is real. 

One of the things I admired about Rich is that he understood what people in this economy are really facing.  He, like most of you, felt it in his bones.  He understood what had happened to workers in this country, like you do.  I’ve got to know a lot of you really, really well.  You just feel it.  You taste it.  You understand it.

I — I get kidded by my staff for — all these years, and I say: I trust the person most who arrives at the right decision when it starts in their gut, it goes to their heart, and then they have the ability to articulate it because they — it goes to the brain.  They’re the ones that never back down.  They’re the ones that stay with you. 

The ones who arrive at it intellectually are the ones that are the ones who first — I welcome that, but they’re not the ones who stay to the end. 

And, you know, Rich understood the past and the challenges, like so many of you who lived and led through these moments.  But he also understood the future.  I think he understood who built this country and the tools that were needed to — to build it back and build it back better. 

You’ve heard me say it a hundred times: We’re the only country in the world that goes into a crisis and, when we come out of it, we’re stronger than before we went in it.  That’s by building back better.

We’re going to build back better.  We have to.  We must.  We will.  Because that’s who we are.  That’s what America is. 

On Labor Day, we honor the dignity of the American worker.  And every day, we remember that America wasn’t built by Wall Street.  They’re not all bad folks out on Wall Street.  I’m not suggesting that.  But they didn’t build America.  It was built by the middle class, and unions built the middle class.  (Applause.)

You gave — you gave workers a voice, all the way back from my Great-grandfather Blewitt who was a mining engineer, back in the days of the Molly Maguires and all the way — and folks who were treated in northeast Pennsylvania, in the coalmines.  You gave people a voice.  Molly Maguires was — they — they were a little tougher.  (Laughter.)  You gave them a hard time, and you ended up on the doorstep, in a bag.

But, you know, think about it: What are the basic things — my dad used to say, “You know, we just thought it would give people ability to just be able to take a deep breath, have a little bit of breathing room.” 

And what — what are those things?  Well, healthcare; a pension, God willing; higher wages and a safer workplace; and protections against discrimination and harassment.  That’s not asking too much. 

We fundamentally transformed how we live and how we work in this country.  The reason we have is because of the victories won by labor.  I’m going to be a bit repetitive: the 8-hour day; the weekend; you know, time and a half for overtime; safety standards; sick days — victories for all of us.  Because, I might add, you know, I noticed when you all do that, everybody benefits — (laughter) — whether they belong to a union or not.  (Applause.)  Whether they belong to a union or not. 

When unions win, workers across the board win.  That’s a fact. Families win, community wins, America wins.  We grow.  And despite this, workers have been getting cut out of the deal for too long a time. 

You know, from 1948, after the war, to 1979, productivity in America increased by more than 100 percent while the pay for American workers grew by nearly 100 percent. 

And then along came 1979, and everything began to change.  Productivity in the country has grown almost four times faster than pay since 1979.  That means the workers have been giving much more to their employers’ bottom lines than they’ve gotten back in their paychecks, breaking the basic bargain of this country.   The bargain was: If you work hard and you contribute to the welfare of the outfit you work with, you got to share in the benefits.

Well, that stopped for a long time.  So, you can carve out your piece of the middle class and make it a possibility.  That’s what got taken away for a lot of people.

Instead, some people started seeing the stock market and corporate profits and executive pay as the only measure for economic growth. 

By the way, the stock market has gone up exponentially since I’ve been President.  You haven’t heard me say a word about it.  (Laughter.)   I’m glad it’s gone up.  No problem.

But, look, let me tell you something: My measure of economic success is how families, like mine growing up — working families busting their neck — how they’re doing; whether they have a little breathing room; whether they have a job that delivers some dignity, a paycheck they can support a family on. 

In an economy — you know, in the economy my administration is building, instead of workers competing with each other for the jobs that are scarce, everybody is mad at me because now — guess what? — employers are competing to attract workers, having to raise pay.  (Applause.)

No, I’m serious.  Think about it.  That kind of competition in the market helps workers earn higher wages.  It also gives them the power to demand dignity and respect in the workplace.

Simply put, worker power is essential to building our economy back better than before — it’s just that basic — to counter corporate power, to grow the economy from the bottom up and the middle out.  I’m so tired of trickle-down. 

I ask, “When has the middle class done better that the wealthy haven’t done incredibly well?”  I can’t think of a time that all the- — when the middle class is booming and moving, everybody does well. 

And to give workers even more power, I also signed an executive order to improve competition in the economy, including calling for a ban on non-compete agreements that deny workers the right to change the job in the same field, even when there’s no real reason for a company to stop them.  It was all about suppressing wages.  That’s what it was about. 

In Congress — when Congress passed the 1935 Labor Relations Act, it didn’t just say you can have unions — it should be allowed.  That’s how it’s kind of viewed for a long time.  It said that we, the government, should encourage unions and collective bargaining, making it easier.  (Applause.)  That’s what it said.

And I believe every worker should have a free and fair choice to join a union.  The law guarantees that choice.  That belongs to workers, not to their employers or to special interests. 

That’s why I signed an executive order creating a White House Task Force on Worker Organizing and Employment [Empowerment]: to facilitate that choice whenever and wherever we can. 

Look, I want to thank Vice President Harris and Secretary Walsh — Marty — for leading that task force.  That’s why I want to see Congress pass the PRO Act and send it to my desk immediately.  That’s why I want us to extend organizing and collective bargaining rights to state and local government employees, like transit workers, first responders, healthcare workers, and other essential workers.  And guess what?  The public seems to agree with that as well.

Government should never be a barrier to workers organizing.  It’s government’s job to remove those barriers.  But it’s up to workers to make the choice whether to organize or not, whether to form a union or not.  And we need to help them understand why that can be the right choice for them.

We know the economic reasons: Union members get higher wages, better benefits, like health insurance and paid leave, protections against discrimination and harassment, and a safer and healthier workplace.

But there’s another reason — a basic American reason.  Workers who join unions gain power — power over the decisions and the decision-makers that affect their lives.  Workers’ voices are heard and heeded.  In a simple word, a union means there is democracy.  Democracy.  Organizing, joining a union — that’s democracy in action.

And it’s about dignity on the job.  But it’s also about creating good jobs.

When I came to office, our first job was to stop the economic bleeding, and it was the worst bleeding since Roosevelt.

We passed the American Rescue Plan.  That delivered shots in arms and checks in pockets, and provided that extra breathing room for working families.

It helped state and cities keep essential workers on the job, including educators, police officers, firefighters, sanitation workers.

And thanks to the part of the Rescue Plan named for Ohio labor leader Butch Lewis, over a million retirees and workers across the country — (applause) — they can trust that the pensions they worked for and sacrificed to secure will be there for them.  (Applause.)

You know, and with the bipartisan agreement we’ve reached to rebuild America’s infrastructure, we’re going to be putting hundreds of thousands of people to work, including plumbers, pipefitters, electrical workers, steel workers, so many other union workers — modernizing roads, bridges, water systems, broadband systems; capping abandoned oil and gas wells that are leaking — over 100,000 of them — making the same salary as digging that well.

It creates jobs for American workers and makes our cities and towns more resilient and better able to meet the climate crisis.

And to keep those jobs here at home, when your government spends the taxpayer’s dollar, it’s going to buying American goods made in America, by American workers.  (Applause.)

Look, over the years, the Buy America[n] Act became a hollow promise.  It’s been there for a long time.  I’m going to make it a reality.

The next stop — the next stop is dealing with the ability to — to pass the rest of my Build Back Better agenda — once-in-a-generation investments in our people, making housing more affordable; bringing down the cost of prescription drugs by giving Medicare the power to negotiate for lower prices — and you ought to thank Bernie Sanders for a lot of this.  (Applause.)  Making eldercare and childcare more affordable while improving the pay for homecare workers and childcare workers.  Providing paid family and medical leave so that no worker is forced to choose between their job and their caregiving responsibilities.  (Applause.)

You’ve all fought for all these things.  We got to make them available to every — provide two years of free, university [universal], high-quality pre-K, and high-quality pre-K — two years that are needed.

It shows that if you send a kid to school at age three, four, and five, they increase by 56 percent the possibility they’ll — no matter what the background — that they’ll go through school all 12 years and do well.

And when I asked — you know, in the Obama administration, I was asked to find out from the CEOs of the Fortune 500 what they most wanted, what they most needed, what was their greatest concern.  And over — I think it was — don’t hold me to the exact number — 348 or -47; I can’t remember the number we got to — said the single-most important thing is they needed a better-educated public. 

But guess what?  They weren’t paying for it.  (Laughter.)  And guess what?  Does anybody think if we were starting off from scratch, setting up public education, we’d say 12 years was enough for the 21st century?

So, look, we have to invest in high-quality job training and apprenticeships in fast-growing sectors; compete to give middle-class families a well-deserved tax cut for daycare and healthcare; and provide a significant monthly tax cut for working families with children.  That’s what it is. 

Everybody talks about my Child Tax Credit; it is a tax cut for ordinary folks.  (Applause.)  That’s what it is.

And as part of that, I want us to see us finally — finally — provide DREAMers, TPS recipients, farmworkers, essential workers a pathway to citizenship, bringing them out of the shadows so they can receive the protection and representation that our laws and our unions provide.  (Applause.)

Folks, we’re making progress.  Our economy has added 750,000 jobs a month on average during the past three months since I’ve been here.  Over — there are more than 4 million jobs since I took office.

In the first half of this year, our economy grew fast — at a fastest rate in 40 years.  Unemployment is down. 

My Build Back Better investments are going to allow us to keep and progress and move further in the years to come.

I just want to add one more thought in closing.

While the pandemic has prevented me from traveling as much as I’d like, I’ve had a chance to meet with many of your brothers and sisters and many of you: the proud UAW members building cars and trucks in Pennsylvania and Michigan, and noting that the mai- — the Big Three have decided that, along with the support of those unions, they’re building — going electric, so we own that market. 

Steelworkers in Portsmouth, Virginia.  I’ve met with longshoremen and firefighters in Columbus.  AFSCME workers in Allentown.  IBEW workers and ironworkers and nurses and grocery store workers in Cincinnati.  Plumbers and — and gasfitters in Maryland.  AFT teachers in Virginia.

And — and, by the way, of course I sleep with an NEA member every night.  Same one.  (Laughter and applause.)  Same one.

Jill had her first day of full-time teaching yesterday, this year.  She’s back to school. 

And, look, I’ve talked with union transit workers, machinists, laborers, and welders in Wisconsin.  We’ve had Teamsters here in the White House.  And always — the Teamsters always have my back.  And, last week, I met with the first responders in New Orleans.  And on Monday, I dropped by some of the IBEW linemen in Delaware helping recover from Hurricane Ida. 

You know, and the — the last year has taught us anything, it’s what’s essential.  And what’s essential is you.  Not a joke.  You and your union members. 

Wall Street could go on strike, but if, all of a sudden, the middle of this cont- — this Ida, every IBEW member resigned, we’d be in real trouble.

I say that to make a generic point.  I think we significantly underestimate — and I think even you guys sometimes underestimate — the incredible value you bring to the safety, security, and growth of the economy.  You know, you’re America’s heart and you’re America’s soul. 

And we all need to fight as hard for them and work as hard for them as we can. 

And I want to say, the press was very, very — not just the press — a lot of people were very, very skeptical that when I was talking about we had to deal with the environment, that labor would never help. 

Well, guess what?  Labor is the reason it’s working.  Labor stepped up.  Because they — you all understand.  And I made a promise, and I’ll keep it — that what we’re talking about here is: When you think of global warming, you think of jobs —  jobs — all the jobs we’re going to create — making us, once again, the fastest-growing — we are now — the most competitive economy in the world.

So, folks, you do it all.  I’m sorry to go on so long, but I can’t — I can’t thank you enough for all you’ve done for the country and what you’ve done for me over my career.  You’ve educated me.  You brought me along.  And you’ve — you’ve always been there.

Now, I’m supposed to stop and walk out of the room here.  (Laughter.)  I’m going to stop.  But with your permission, I’m going to walk into the room because I want to say hello to all of you. 

Thank you.  (Applause.) ",President,Joe Biden,https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/speeches-remarks/2021/09/08/remarks-by-president-biden-in-honor-of-labor-unions/,,OTHERS
